# To add a train model you need to add its wagin datas first and then assign that wagon data to which equipments/countries/continents it should show up
# a wagon data entry looks like this


# wagon_data = {
# 	entity = european_train_locomotive_01_entity # name of the entity
# 	scale = 2.5 # entity can be scaled if default entity scale is off
# 	rotation = 0.5 # entity can be rotationd if default rotation is wrong
# 	length = length of the wagon entity. wagons are attached together like a chain. this should be the chain link of chain (if wagons will interlop with each other this is smaller then entity length)
# 	shift = { 0.0 0.0 0.0 } # wagon entities should be position by 0 position being their back point (the point that will be attached to prev wagon). if not the entoty can be shifted
# }

# once wagons are defined its entity name should be put under either default, continent or a country tag
# the usage is
# default/continent/tag = {
#   equipment_type/equipment_archetype = {
#		# locomotives will be used for first wagon of the train
#		locomotives = { ... wagon_data entities defined under wagon_data }
#		# wagons are used for other wagons
#		wagons = { ... wagon_data entities defined under wagon_data }
#	}
#}

# the game will randomly pick an existing equipment to spawn a train and use that equipment type
# it will first check if any there is an existing train entry using following order
# equipment type under country
# equipment type under continent
# equipment type under default
# equipment archetype under country
# equipment archetype under continent
# equipment archetype under default

# it will do this seperately for wagons and entities
