####Here is a little preface so that this is never forgotten on how it works
####Events fired in 1857 are fired on_startup
####An on_yearly effect in on_yearly.txt will check the year/decade
####Every two years a scripted effect will be fired that contains the KDE events
####The timeline is as follows
+##1857 on_startup events fired
##1858-1859 first set of events 
##1860-1861 second set of events
##1862-1863 third set of events 


####USE THE Reverse_date_calculation Python script in toi/documentation to find out what date your event fires on
####All you have to do is enter the start date (11 May 1857) and then enter the number of days until your event fires
####You can then put that date into the Event_date_calculation python file to discover the amount of days from the start to your event(AS OF NOW THIS IS NOT FINISHED)
