 FIN_the_language_strife_desc:0 "From the moment the Grand Duchy became part of Russia, Swedish was still seen and used as the official language in Finland, much to the pleasure of the Svecomans, but to the disappointment of the Fennomans, who wanted to enforce Finnish as the offical language to strenghten the Finnish culture and identity. This conflict begins to become prevalent in our society and is hindering us at reforming our system and thwarts in the question of independence. We need to solve this issue as quickly as possible!"

Finland has fought and survived throughout the times, this time won't be any different! We shall honour old ancestors and forge a common nation for all the people of Finland!

 ### FOCUS TREE
 ### Economy-Industry
 FIN_status_of_economy:0 "The Finnish Economy"
 FIN_status_of_economy_desc:0 "If we want to modernise our outdated economy, we have to take a look at it first and see which parts of our industry can be improved and modernised."
 FIN_question_of_industralization:0 "Direction of Finnish Economy"
 FIN_question_of_industralization_desc:0 "Whilst our economy is mostly agricultural, we also have a quickly growing industrial and commercial sector. We have to decide now, whether we want to keep our focus on our strong agricultural sector and have a slower industrialisation of our country, or if we want to focus on a rapid industrialisation, like the countries in Western Europe did."
 FIN_rapid_industralization:0 "Focus on Industry"
 FIN_rapid_industralization_desc:0 "We should focus on our Industry sector, as the Western countries did. Despite it's setbacks, we have to gain more with this path than with continuing on our current path."
 FIN_slowly_industralization:0 "Focus on Agriculture"
 FIN_slowly_industralization_desc:0 "Instead of rushing down a rapid industrialisation path, where we would essentially give up our strong agriculture sector, we could slow down our industrialisation and also keep a focus on our agriculture. This would allow us to maintain a lot of workplaces for our labour force, but also to prevent the same issues that happened in already industrialised countries after their rapid industrialisation began."
 FIN_power_for_factories:0 "Power for Factories"
 FIN_power_for_factories_desc:0 "We have the option to obtain foreign blue prints for factories. This would help us massively, since we don't need to develop these plans for ourselves and could begin to build our factories earlier."
 FIN_textile_industry:0 "Textile Industry"
 FIN_textile_industry_desc:0 "One of our economic branches that could profit from our industrialisation is our Textile Industry. But for that, we will have to finance the textile mills and cotton farms in our country. But in the end, our investions will pay off, when we will be able to produce our own fabrics."
 FIN_foreign_investors:0 "Invite Foreign Investors"
 FIN_foreign_investors_desc:0 "By improving relations with Great Britain and Prussia they may be more open to the idea in investing into Finland, this would involve the iron mines in Lappi and Savo, chromium in Lappi and Uusimaa, combined with infrastructure in Pohjanmaa. All of this would be greatly benificial for the development of our industry and economy in general."
 FIN_modernisation_of_ironwork_factories:0 "Modernisation of Ironwork Factories"
 FIN_modernisation_of_ironwork_factories_desc:0 "With foreign investors and other nations now financing our economy we may be able to modernise some of our outdated equipment and factories, such as our ironwork factories. By this we could ensure that we are able to produce the needed iron. We could also use the money we gain through the iron to open up new coal mines and steel mills in our country, further accelarting industrialisation."
 FIN_tamflet_company:0 "Tamfelt Company"
 FIN_tamflet_company_desc:0 "One of the companies that are ready to be our partner in the build-up of our industry is the Tampere-based Tamfelt Company."
 FIN_sawmill_industry:0 "Sawmill Industry"
 FIN_sawmill_industry_desc:0 "Finland is a country, where most of the territory is forested. We could use that to our advantage by putting up logging camps, where we cut down the trees and use them in our industry. By that we could develop our wood industry."
 FIN_abolishtion_of_job_regulation:0 "Regulate The Workday"
 FIN_abolishtion_of_job_regulation_desc:0 "There is a issue we still need to solve in our economy, regarding the workers. Until now, there is no regulation regarding the length of workdays, forcing workers to work longer than they can rest from their work. This obviously takes a toll on the workers. We should look into this issue and try to regulate the workdays, even if it means that efficency will lower. Our workforce will be thankful for it."
 FIN_new_custom_policy:0 "New Customs Policy"
 FIN_new_custom_policy_desc:0 "Finland should seek playing a more important role in the european market by opening up our economy. We will be able to produce and export more, meaning that we will be taking more money, which we could in turn use to finance our industry again."
 FIN_dockyard_industry:0 "Future of Dockyard Industry"
 FIN_dockyard_industry_desc:0 "With our financial situation stabilised and our industry being as effective as never before, we can look into other branches to invest into. One of the branches we could invest into is our dockyard industry, where a lot of progress has been made, too, and which could allow us to increase our naval production."
 FIN_mekaniska_verkstads:0 "Mekaniska Verkstads"
 FIN_mekaniska_verkstads_desc:0 "One of the company that could help us in this regard, is the Swedish company Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads, a company, that is able to produce machines and build ships for us."
 FIN_new_agriculture_laws:0 "Allow Land Purchase"
 FIN_new_agriculture_laws_desc:0 "We should give peasents the opportunity to buy their own land, as we think that this could motivate them even more to work on their farms then. This would have a great effect on the Finnish economy and it's agriculture sector. We also believe it could promote crops, in years where no famines are approaching."
 FIN_fight_with_hunger:0 "Prevent Future Famines"
 FIN_fight_with_hunger_desc:0 "We had famines in the past, we could still have famines nowadays, and in the future as well. But if we want to lower the opportunity for something like that to happen, we could establish new farms in other regions. One step we can take is to establish farms in Uusimaa, Pohjanmaa and Savo."
 FIN_search_for_russian_investor:0 "Invite Russian Investors"
 FIN_search_for_russian_investor_desc:0 "As our overlord, the Russian Empire should invest into our economy, but depending on their policy this may not be the case. Instead, we could try to convince some Russian investors to finance some industrial branches in Finland. This could be the wood industry in Lappi, which we could expand with investions and the iron mines and infrastructure in Savo, which we could improve with Russian investments."
 FIN_fiskari_industry:0 "Fiskari Industry"
 FIN_fiskari_industry_desc:0 "The Fiskars company is interested in becoming our partner and advisor in our industry. Employing them with this task we could benefit economically and in terms of researching new technologies, e.g. in the engineering sector."
 FIN_fiskari_dominance:0 "Fiskari Corporate Branching"
 FIN_fiskari_dominance_desc:0 "Fiskars has announced that they have a interest in expanding in Finland and in opening more factories and steel works."
 FIN_finnish_industralization:0 "Finnish Industralization" 
 FIN_finnish_industralization_desc:0 "We have taken all the necessary steps to begin Industrialising and are currently in the process of doing so. This has a big effect on our former agrarian society."
 ### Economy-Infrastructure
 FIN_establishment_finnish_railways_board:0 "Establish The Rautatiejohtokunta"
 FIN_establishment_finnish_railways_board_desc:0 "Establishing the Rautatiejohtokunta (Railways Board) will let us supervise the construction and smooth operation of the railway lines, as well as track traffic and report to Finnish Diet for any proposed changes, via the high authority for roads and waterways."
 FIN_encourage_domestic_train:0 "Encourage Production of Domestic Trains"
 FIN_encourage_domestic_train_desc:0 "Since we have the industry needed for it, perhaps we should invest into the production of trains in Finland itself, making us independent from others in this regard. Producing and using Finnish trains will save us a lot of money we would use when buying foreign-produced trains. We would also ensure that our trains are up to modern standards, something we could not guarantee when using foreign trains, as they could be relunctant to sell us their most modern version."
 FIN_establish_suomen:0 "Establish the Suomen Valtiollinen Rautatielaitos"
 FIN_establish_suomen:0 "Since we began to build and improve some of our railway infrastructure, we should establish a state-owned company that is responsible for improving, maintaining and expanding the railway infrastructure in Finland. This is the birth of Suomen Valtiollinen Rautatielaitos!"
 FIN_hanko_hyvinkaa_railway:0 "Hanko - Hyvinkää Railroad"
 FIN_hanko_hyvinkaa_railway_desc:0 "Building a railway between the coastal city Hanko and Hyvinkää, right on the outskirts of Helsinki, will help us to transport our imported goods at a faster speed. It will also help our soldiers in combat, as their supply will arrive faster from our hub in Helsinki. §RWarning: §WThis decision will require the completion of level 5 infastructure in Uusimaa."
 FIN_tampere_helsinki_railway:0 "Tampere - Helsinki Railway"
 FIN_tampere_helsinki_railway_desc:0 "Building a railway between our capital city Helsinki and one of our bigger cities, Tampere, will help in the transportation of goods and other things in Uusimaa. It is a project worth investing into."
 FIN_riihimaki_saint_petersburg_railway:0 "Riihimäki - St. Petersburg Railroad"
 FIN_riihimaki_saint_petersburg_railway_desc:0 "Building a railway between Riihimäki, right on the outskirts of Helsinki and St.Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire, will ensure a better connection between Finland and Russia and make it easier to transport imported goods, that arrived in St.Petersburg into our country. Maybe we could even connect this railway with the railway that runs from Hyvinkää to Hanko and have one railway that runs all the way through Uusimaa and Karjala. §RWarning: §WThis decision will require the completion of level 5 infastructure in Karjala."
 FIN_helsinki_turku_railway:0 "Helsinki - Turku Railway"
 FIN_helsinki_turku_railway_desc:0 "Whilst we have now build railway from the outskirts of Helsinki to cities like Tampere, Hanko and St.Petersburg, we still lack a railway that connects Helsinki itself with other big cities in Finland, keeping Finland split into various, nearly unreachable, regions. And to solve this issue, our engineers propose a railway that runs from Helsinki to Turku, connecting two of the biggest cities in Finland, and perhaps even connecting Finland itself." 
 FIN_railway_start:0 "Import Transport Technologies"
 FIN_railway_start_desc:0 "If we decide to import foreign transport technologies, we would have the chance to build and improve our own railway and train models faster and more efficient. It would allow us to support our industrialisation process even more."
 FIN_state_railway_investment:0 "State Railways Investments"
 FIN_state_railway_investment_desc:0 "The question of whether Finland or a private company should take control of the construction and maintaining of railways has been brought up. The answer is simple, it is the government who should take control of these matters, as railways are a national issue, where every individual is involved in. Whilst the construction of railways will be slower than with a private company constructing it, in the end only those railways will be build that are deemed necessary and needed."
 FIN_private_railway_investment:0 "Private Railway Investments"
 FIN_private_railway_investment_desc:0 "Perhaps giving some private companies the opportunity to build our railways will help us more than constructing the railways ourselves. On the one hand we would be not be able to plan them, we would also not need to finance them, as the private companies would do that instead of us. We could also expect them to work more efficient than us, since they have a interest in finishing and putting them into service as fast as possible and bringing the invested money back in as fast as they can."
 FIN_hameenlinna_helsinki_line:0 "Hämeenlinna - Helsinki Railroad"
 FIN_hameenlinna_helsinki_line_desc:0 "With financing now secured and other railway lines around Helsinki and in Uusimaa in general, including a connection to St.Petersburg now completed, we should set our eyes towards a more ambitious construction project. Hämeenlinna is one of our industrial cities and connecting it with Helsinki secures a flow of those processed products into our capital. This railway will be important now, but in the long term as well, so we should begin with construction as fast as possible."
 ### Economy-Fleet
 FIN_new_technical_school:0 "New Technical School"
 FIN_new_technical_school_desc:0 "With our fleet destroyed, we had no opportunity to enter maritime trade and made us more dependent from Russia. But no more! As of today we will begin the rebuild of our fleet and return on the European maritime trade floor! We have already begun rebuilding the dockyard industry, which will come in handy. With a fleet and intensive trade with other countries we may be able to further lower Russian influence over our country!"
 FIN_engineering_programmes:0 "Engineering Programmes"
 FIN_engineering_programmes_desc:0 "With the usage of engineering programms we could use the knowledge of people to accelerate the production of ships and our return into trading with overseas powers."
 FIN_buy_transport_tech:0 "Acquire Transport Technologies"
 FIN_buy_transport_tech_desc:0 "We could acquire new maritime transport technologies from abroad, helping us to construct our ships even faster, which is the highest priority right now."
 FIN_trade_fleets:0 "Trade Fleets"
 FIN_trade_fleets_desc:0 "We have taken our first step towards rebuilding our merchant fleet. The basic infrastructure for rebuilding our ships is finished. With ship production beginning and a speed up in dockyard reconstruction independence tradewise is coming nearer day by day!"
 FIN_helsingin_laivatelakka_osakeyhtio:0 "Helsingin Laivatelakka Osakeyhtiö"
 FIN_helsingin_laivatelakka_osakeyhtio_desc:0 "One of the companies that want to partner us in rebuilding our merchant fleet is Helsingin Laivatelakka Osakeyhtiö. Using them our efforts will pay off definitetly and we could be able to work faster and more efficient with their help!"
 FIN_martime_trade:0 "Martime Trade"
 FIN_martime_trade_desc:0 "We have done it! With a lot of effort and help from some of our Finnish companies we have managed to rebuild our long-destroyed merchant fleet. This will definitetly help us taking a step towards our independence and away from the Russian sphere! But for now, let's use the rebuild fleet and start with trading with the other powers."
 
 ### Military-Fleet
 FIN_crimea_war_lesson:0 "Lessons of The Crimean War"
 FIN_crimea_war_lesson_desc:0 "During the Crimean War, lasting the last years, our overlord Russia played a big role in it. Our involvement in the war, on Russia's side, meant that we lost out in the end. But, as it is with all the wars, we have learned some lessons in this war and need to implement changes in the army to be able to prevent us from losing a war again!"
 FIN_suomen_meriekipassi:0 "Finnish Meriekipaasi"
 FIN_suomen_meriekipassi_desc:0 "During the Crimean War naval and coastal warfare were important parts of warfare, as seen during our fights at our coastal areas and during the bombing and invasion of Aland. Establishing and improving our navy, we could prevent our enemies to reach those territiories the next time we are fighting a war. One way of achieving this, is, of course, to design and build better ships, which was what our admiral Johan Eberhard von Schantz did! He came to us with a proposal of a new ship, the Meriekipaasi! Perhaps accepting the proposal of building this ship will help us in strenghtening our fleet?"
 FIN_expansion_of_fortresss_sveaborg:0 "Expansion of Fortress Sveaborg"
 FIN_expansion_of_fortresss_sveaborg_desc:0 "Whilst we can improve our navy and try to hinder the enemy of reaching our coasts, we also have to prepare for cases, where we will fail in doing so. One way of doing that is to expand coastal fortresses, like Fortress Sveaborg on our southern coast! If the former can't save us, the later will for sure help us to defend us. And by focusing on Finnish Marine divisions we can protect our coastlines better by storming with our Marines where the fighting needs them the most!"
 FIN_gamla_warfsbolaget_i_abo:0 "Gamla Warfsbolaget i Åbo"
 FIN_gamla_warfsbolaget_i_abo_desc:0 "The Turku-based company Gamla Warfsbolaget i Åbo has offered us to cooperate with us in the naval sector of our industry and military. Handing them our requests would have it's pros for us, as our partners could plan and build our ships, that are going to be part of our navy, much more quickly and more effective than us. The production cost would also be lower, meaning that we would still have money to invest into other parts of our industry."
 FIN_rjurik_kalevala:0 "Rjurik and Kalevala"
 FIN_rjurik_kalevala_desc:0 "With our partnership settled, we can now go ahead and begin with the construction of the Rjurik and Kalevala corvette classes. Whilst they would definitetly strenghten our navy, they also would secure our definite independence in marine matters, as we would not be dependent on the Russian navy anymore to protect ourselves!"
 ### Military-Army 
 FIN_future_of_army:0 "Future of The Army"
 FIN_future_of_army_desc:0 "With our 'success' in the Crimean War analysed now, we have seen where we should improve our military now to prevent our past failures to happen again, like they did in the last war. Perhaps we should also look how we can leave the Russian Sphere in army matters, which would lower Russian influence in our country even further, and push us further towards independence!" 
 FIN_help_from_russia:0 "Seek Russian Support"
 FIN_help_from_russia_desc:0 "Even if we want to strive towards independence and this means that we should try to improve our military independently from the Russian Empire, they are still our overlords and also still one of the five great European Powers. So maybe we should turn to them and try to reform our army with the analysis of our and their experiences of the Crimean War and to eradicate our weakpoints from the past war, even if it means to setback on our ambitions to become independent from Russia."
 FIN_guard_rifle_battalion:0 "Expansion of Finnish Guards' Rifle Battalion"
 FIN_guard_rifle_battalion_desc:0 "With Russia humiliated by surrendering in the last war, the Tsar is furious and will surely want to prevent another situation like this happening. So, we may actually have good cards, when we propose to him to allow another 50.000 men into the Finnish Guards' Rifle Battalion, which would surely strengthen our military a lot!"
 FIN_grenadier_sharpshooters:0 "Status of the Sharpshooter Battalion"
 FIN_grenadier_sharpshooters_desc:0 "Another problem we had in the Crimean War is that our equipment in the battles, so if we want to further improve our army, we also have to improve our equipment!"
 FIN_helsinki_junker_school:0 "Helsinki Junker School"
 FIN_helsinki_junker_school_desc:0 "A basic problem we encountered during the last war is that we had few officers, who actually were able to plan a strategy and providing the soldiers with one, the other armies were weakened by missing a 'compentent' officer. If we want to tackle this issue, we need to open up junker schools, like in Helsinki, so that we can teach our officers, what they have to do whilst fighting or when planning a strategy."
 FIN_milyutin_reforms:0 "Milyutin's Reforms in The Finnish Army"
 FIN_milyutin_reforms_desc:0 "In the last months we have managed to improve and strenghten our army, with the help of our gracious Russian overlords. But, as Milyutin's reforms are implemented in Finland, we have not only setback our ambitions to become independent, but also given up our integrity, by deciding to work together with our 'devil'. Let's see if it at least pays off that we have taken this step now."
 FIN_hire_foreign_instructors:0 "Hire Foreign Instructors"
 FIN_hire_foreign_instructors_desc:0 "Listening to our Russian 'overlords' has brought us into this situation, where we have a outdated army and equipment and have lost the last war. Working together with foreign instructors will help us to improve our army even more than any collaboration with Russia would do, as they would deliberatly set us back to stop us from following our path to independence!"
 FIN_learn_from_prussians:0 "Prussian Guidance"
 FIN_learn_from_prussians_desc:0 "Prussia, sometimes also called the 'Army with a State', has managed to build up their military might during the 1700s to the point that they are one of the Great Powers in Europe and one of the leading countries in Germany, in regards to the army. Perhaps working together with them will effect and motivate our army to become stronger and show us, what steps we need to take if we want to have a stronger army!"
 FIN_prussian_discipline:0 "Prussian Discipline"
 FIN_prussian_discipline_desc:0 "One of the things that makes Prussias army that strong is their strict army discipline. Perhaps we should try to emulate that. If we show the average soldier, what fighting for Finland and it's folk means, they may feel extra motivated to take the fight towards their enemies! This could even strenghten our patriotic and independence movement!"
 FIN_purchase_dreyse_rifles:0 "Purchase Prussian Weapons"
 FIN_purchase_dreyse_rifles_desc:0 "Not only do Prussian troops have a good militaristic ideal, apprenticeship and discipline, but they also have the most modern and greatest weapons of our time! As we need to modernise our equipment as well, we should take the opportunity and buy Prussias rifles. It will further strenghten our fighting spirit!"
 FIN_swedish_instructors:0 "Swedish Guidance"
 FIN_swedish_instructors_desc:0 "Even though the Swedes have repressed and colonised us since the 1100's, we should put our differences aside and look to Sweden, as they are our geological neighbour and we have fought countless wars together with them. They have shown multiple times that they are a force not to be underestimated."
 FIN_heritage_of_hakkapelitas:0 "Heritage of Hakkapeliitta"
 FIN_heritage_of_hakkapelitas_desc:0 "During the rule of the Swedish Empire in Finland the Swedes had strong cavalry stationed in Finland. After Russia made us a dominion of them, our cavalry units were dissolved. Perhaps we should seek to replicate the history we had with cavalry under the Swedish rule."
 FIN_common_manouvers:0 "Joint Military Maneuvers"
 FIN_common_manouvers_desc:0 "Now that we have improved our relations with Sweden in regard of the army, we have the opportunity to organise a Joint Military exercise with Sweden. This would help our army as they would learn more things and gain experience through it. We also got a offer from Sweden that they would be ready to sell us their cannons and rifles."
 FIN_army_reform:0 "Army Reform"
 FIN_army_reform_desc:0 "Now that we have analysed our failures in Crimea, have taken measures to prevent this from ever happening again, have reorganised and improved our army structure and equipment, we can deem our army rework finished! Another step towards independence taken!"
 
 ### Post-Famine country rebuild
 FIN_rotschild_loan:0 "Loans from Rotschild Family"
 FIN_rotschild_loan_desc:0 "A famine has struck us! Finland's agriculture economy crashed in a unpredecented way! The lack of crop means that people have to starve! We have to act quickly if we want to help and save our people. A first step of this would be boost our economy after the events that happened during the last days and to import foreign foodstuff to be able to feed our people to stop them from starving. But to do that we need money, and that's what we are lacking currently. But we are having luck (for once), as the Rotschild Bank of Frankfurt offers us a loan, with which we can finance those much needed things."
 FIN_famine_public_railway:0 "Public Railway and Infrastructure Works"
 FIN_famine_public_railway_desc:0 "Our population has a problem. Since the most of our labourers are working in the agriculture sector, 85% to be exact, most of our population has not been able to earn money due to the famine striking. But we have found a solution. The rapid growing industrial sector means that railways are getting more and more important as time goes on. As we still have to build some of these railways and expand our railway service, we could allow workers from the agriculure sector to join our workforce. This would benefit us and them. Us,  because we could finish those projects faster with a bigger workforce. Them, because they will be able to earn some much needed money, which they will need to buy substitute food, as their food was destroyed by the famine. A typical win-win situation, right?"
 FIN_pettu_bread:0 "Pettu Bread"
 FIN_pettu_bread_desc:0 "As we currently have no grain to produce our much needed food, we will have to resort to producing pettu bread, made out of bark, until we can guarantee a stable grain harvest again!"
 FIN_emergency_use_markka:0 "Emergency Use of Markka"
 FIN_emergency_use_markka_desc:0 "When the Famine first arrived and it became clear that we would not be able to sustain ourselves, because of the poor harvest, we had the opportunity to borrow loans to buy our food from Central European markets, but we foolishly refused it to prevent the Markka getting weakened by high interest rates. But as the crisis goes on and on it becomes clearer that we have to do something to be able to borrow loans to finance imported food. So, we will advice our Finance minister Johan Vilhelm Snellman to devalue the Markka, so that we can continue our course and borrow more loans!"
 FIN_ask_grain_shipment:0 "Foreign Grain Shipments"
 FIN_ask_grain_shipment_desc:0 "As our 'Overlord', the Russian Empire should help us in our fight against the famine. We will ask them if they could ship us some of their grain, so that we have some in reserve and can produce some more bread and other products, for which grain is needed."
 FIN_recover_famine_year:0 "Recover from Famine"
 FIN_recover_famine_year_desc:0 "We have had a difficult year with harvesting, as a famine did strike us, after our crops were ravaged during the last years as well. That meant that we ran out of crops, especially grain, with which we could sustain ourselves. Hunger and poverty were the result. We, as authority have reacted too late and with wrong measures, which reinforced the problems we had. But we have began to recover. Setting up emergency works we managed to further expand our railway infrastructure needed for the industrialisation and also give the farmers and workers from the agriculture sectors a job, with which they could earn some money, after the harvest was destroyed. We have taken measures to secure our grain reserves and fill them up before using them again. Fortunately, Russia was able to and willing to leave us some of their grain, with which we could produce some much needed goods, like bread, whilst we also had the opportunity to stock up our grain reserves. And at last, we also rediscovered some alternative ways of producing food, which we used, to stabilize society after the famine. But now, Finland is slowly recovering from the famine and so do her citizens."
 FIN_boost_industrialization:0 "Promote Post Famine Industralisation"
 FIN_boost_industrialization_desc:0 "The famine is finally over after a good year with a better than average harvest. Still many people, weakened by the famine, are dying of contagious diseases. Luckily for the authorities, the general population have seen the last years horrors as an act of God, not delayed and inadequate actions of the government, who they didn’t expect to do more anyway. If there has been anger, then it has been directed mainly at local officials. Social order seems not to be under any kind of threat since people are more focused on returning to normal lives again. This will sadly take time, although final numbers will probably never be known, the death toll has been horrible. Some regions report that one in five have succumbed during the last two years. Lessons have been learned, however. More programs have been launched to improve the communications in Finland and to increase the diversity of the Finnish agriculture, those hoping that recurrence of a famine like this will never happen again."
 
 ### Politics
 FIN_the_porvoo_diet:0 "The Porvoo Diet"
 FIN_the_porvoo_diet_desc:0 "At the end of the Russo-Swedish War in 1809, a legislative assembly gathered in the town of Porvoo and was attended by the four estates by then occupied Finland, the nobility, clergy, burglars and peasents. The main reason for their gathering was the establishment of our Grand Duchy of Finland as part of the Russian Empire with our former representatives taking an oath and promising loyality to Tsar Alexander, who in return promised to keep the current Finnish contitution and promised to respect the Finnish laws, rights and religion and to rule Finland according to their former rules, a promise that he did not keep. Even though the Finnish Diet was meant to reconvene after the end of the Russo-Swedish War, it didn't assemble again, even to this day!"
 FIN_the_january_comitee:0 "The January Committee"
 FIN_the_january_comitee_desc:0 "After the death of Nicholas I. and the ascendence of Alexander II. on the Russian throne, hopes for reform arose in the Finnish people. Alexander II. went to the Diet on easter day and told them about the issues in different parts of the countries and wanted to reinstate a Diet to take on the problems in Finland. A list of measures was drawn up and send to the emperor, who hesitated to convene a Diet, because it would have not been popular. It was decided then that a unconstitutional comitee should meet in January 1862 and prepare the topic needed for the diet and to prepare the diet itself. The members of the committee will bee elected and the 4 estates will have each 3 representatives in the committee."

After half a century, Swedish is still used in Finnish politics, even if only 15% speak Swedish as their first language. This remnant stems from the time, where Finland was rules by Sweden. Whilst the Svecomans have the ambition to defend the status quo, the Fennomans on the other hand want to achieve, that the Finnish and Swedish language have the same importance in politics. We have to decide now which path we want to follow in terms of language. It could boost our independence ambitions if we choose right!"

Since the release of the epic 'Kalevala' in 1835, Karelianism became a major trend in Finland and Karelia became synonomous with the idee of 'Finnishness' and authencity all over Finland, and it awankened Finnish national pride and patriotism.

 ### EVENTS
 ### Focus Tree Events ###
 finlandfocus.1.t:0 "State of The Finnish Economy"
 finlandfocus.1.d:0 "The Finnish Economy is traditionally agrarian, but with the begin of the Industrial Revolution in the last century, more and more countries industrialised and so, the idea of industrialisation reached us. And whilst our country is still mostly agricultural, with 85% of the labour force working in this sector, we have had a rapid growing industrial and commercial sector in the last years. As for the Finnish production per capita, it grew yearly around 0.4 %, although this was a minimum estimate as it did not account for livestock and some cereals."
 finlandfocus.1.a:0 "Our economy needs modernisation!"
 finlandfocus.2.t:0 "Future of Industrialisation"
 finlandfocus.2.d:0 "The time has come to choose in which direction we want to head in the next years regarding the question of the industrialisation. We have the choice between §RIndustrialising§! our economy or keeping our focus on §Gagriculture§!."
 finlandfocus.2.a:0 "Industrialisation is the way to go!"
 finlandfocus.2.b:0 "Focusing on agriculture is the right step!"
 finlandfocus.3.t:0 "Monetary Reform in Finland"
 finlandfocus.3.d:0 "This year the national Bank of Finland decided to introduce Finland's own currency, the Finnish Markka! One Markka is equal to 100 Finnish Pennies. With the introduction of the Markka, it was decided that the Markka should be linked with the Russian Rouble, and have an exchange rate of four Markka to one Rouble. The idea of a own currency for Finland, replacing the Russian Rouble and, albeit less often used, the Swedish Riksdaler, is often credited to Senator Carl Fabian Langenskiöld, also called the "father of the mark". With the introduction of it's own currency, Finland takes a further step towards independence!"
 finlandfocus.3.a:0 "Long live the Markka!"
 finlandfocus.4.t:0 "Appointment of Johan Snellman"
 finlandfocus.4.d:0 "Today, Johan Vilhelm Snellman, a Fennoman and former lecturer at the Helsinki Unitersity, was appointed senator and was made the minister of finance. Snellman is considered as a controversial figure in politics, as he was a fervent supporter of the Finnish language and culture, something that was rejected by the Svecomans, who wanted to enforce Swedish language and culture and the Tsar, as Finland was to be russified. That situation changed when Russia lost the Crimean War. Tsar Alexander II., fearing a strong sense of Scandinavian unity, wanted to strenghten the Finnish identity and language. To achieve that, he decided to promote Fennomans, like Johan Snellman, into high positions, first appointing him as chair of philosophy in the Helsinki University, before appointing him as Senator and finance minister. Snellman himself will surely have the interest to strenghten Finnish culture, language and identity as he is a Fennoman, but also a great Finnish patriot. He will surely want to support the Markka being the only currency in Finland, but not only that, as the Markka should only be tied to the silver rate, and as the minister in finance he will have authority over these cases. He also shares a close relationship with the Tsar, so we could be able to reform our currency system even further than that and to strenghten Finnish identity and Finland itself!"
 finlandfocus.4.a:0 "For Finland!"
 finlandfocus.5.t:0 "The Finnish Diet"
 finlandfocus.5.d:0 "The Finnish Diet can be described as a form of 'parliament' Finland has. It was introduced by Sweden with the four estates of Sweden (nobility, clergy, burglars and peasents) meating and discussing important issues and voting on whether the Emperor should get to decide whether he wants to implement the law the diet has voted for or not. Finland, as part of Sweden, adopted their legislative assembly without altering something. It was meant to meet every 5 years, but after the Diet of Porvoo the diet did not meet again to this day."
 finlandfocus.5.a:0 "A Parliament in Finland?!"
 finlandfocus.6.t:0 "Kielireskripti"
 finlandfocus.6.d:0 "For a long time we have been facing an issue with our identity. While for some time we have embraced our previous overlord Sweden's language and culture by force. It's time to decide ether to embrace our own way, with the guidance of our top intellectuals and and land owning peasants; Or with the old Swedish minority nobility. "
 finlandfocus.6.a:0 "I guess we should sort this situation out..." 
 finlandfocus.7.t:0 "Appointing a New Minister!"
 finlandfocus.7.d:0 "Elias Lönnrot who is the author of our great national epoch "Kalevala", has been appointed a position at the senate. This is a great day for the Fennomans!"
 finlandfocus.7.a:0 "Hurraa!"
 finlandfocus.8.t:0 "Appointing a New Minister!"
 finlandfocus.8.d:0 "Axel Olof Freudenthal who is the author of our many racial theories of Swedish superiority and Finnish inferiority has been appointed a position at the senate. This is a great day for the Svecomans, bad day for the Fennomans!"
 finlandfocus.8.a:0 "Att vi skulle vara Finländare är en absurd och befängd idé, vi är Svenskar!"
 finlandfocus.9.t:0 "Voting Rights Discussion"
 finlandfocus.9.d:0 "It has been decided. The senate has passed a bill that allows amending of the right to vote for university representatives, landowner peasants and priests. At the same time the practice, according to which the current nobles could appoint by proxy any member of the nobility as representative to the Diet of their dynasty, was also restored. The practice had abolished by Gustav III in 1778. Hopefully this should buy us people's support for our future endevours." 
 finlandfocus.9.a:0 "Absurd, voting rights for more lower class? Hmph."
 finlandfocus.10.t:0 "The Diet of 1867"
 finlandfocus.10.d:0 "The Diet of 1867 is the third diet that convenes in Finland, after the Porvoo Diet in 1809 and the Diet of 1867, four years after the last one has convened. Whilst the last diet has convened to decide on the question of the language in Finland, this one will rather be preoccupied with economical matters, like the currency of Finland. We are anticipated to see how this Diet will change the destiny of Finland!"
 finlandfocus.10.a:0 "Let's see..."
 finlandfocus.11.t:0 "Estates Representatives For Diet"
 finlandfocus.11.d:0 "With the election of the Diet now finished and the representatives gathering in the Diet, it's time to name the representatives of the 4 estates! \n\nRepresentating the nobility will: Johan Mauritz Nordenstam \nThe representative of the Klergy is: Edvard Bergenheim \nThe bailiffs are representated by: Frans Wilhelm von Frenckell \nAnd at last, the peasents' represenataive is Aukusti Mäkipeska. \n\nThe Diet will start it's work soon, but whether it will be productive or not will be decided by the ability of the richer estates, especially the nobles and bailiffs, working together with the lower estates, like peasants. Their difficult relationship and their different status with one another may lead to problems, especially if one feels superior than others..."
 finlandfocus.11.a:0 "For our future!"
 finlandfocus.12.t:0 "Passing New Knights Act"
 finlandfocus.12.d:0 "The New Knights Act was a act that should reform the internal affairs of Finland, especially the relationship between the noble family and the Finnish Diet, amongst other topics. The nobleman got the right to appoint a representative for his family line, that took his place in the Diet instead of the nobleman himself. Other issues dealt with the nobles themselves, as the act stipulated that the noblemen could not be seperated by class division. The hierachy of the military also got slightly changed, since the act demanded that a special Vice-Marshal should be appointed alongside the Grand Marshal in Finland."
 finlandfocus.12.a:0 "A good and necessary act!"
 finlandfocus.12.b:0 "We cannot risk to anger the nobles."
 finlandfocus.13.t:0 "The January Committee"
 finlandfocus.13.d:0 "After the death of Nicholas I. and the ascendence of Alexander II. on the Russian throne, hopes for reform arose in the Finnish people. Alexander II. went to the Diet on easter day and told them about the issues in different parts of the countries and wanted to reinstate a Diet to take on the problems in Finland. A list of measures was drawn up and send to the emperor, who hesitated to convene a Diet, because it would have not been popular. It was decided then that a unconstitutional comitee should meet in January 1862 and prepare the topic needed for the diet and to prepare the diet itself. The members of the committee will bee elected and the 4 estates will have each 3 representatives in the committee."
 finlandfocus.13.a:0 "We need to convene as fast as possible"
 finlandfocus.13.b:0 "We don't need a new Diet"
 finlandfocus.14.t:0 "The April Manifesto"
 finlandfocus.14.d:0 "The April Manifesto, signed at the 10th of April by Tsar Alexander II., and published in the 17th of April in Finland, dealt with the establishment of a commitee that should propose changes to the Diet of Finland. The civilians and the Finnish Senate were distressed by the announcement that such a committee would be established, as they feared that it would eventually replace the Finnish Diet. Liberals and Landowners already plan to organise protests!"
 finlandfocus.14.a:0 "We cannot allow it to happen!"
 finlandfocus.14.b:0 "Perhaps we should take a step back and see how it unfolds?"
 finlandfocus.15.t:0 "Helsinki Demonstration"
 finlandfocus.15.d:0 "The announcement of the April Manifesto has caused great outrage and protests! After the Seante failed to come up with a declaration to ask the Tsar to take a look at the legitimacy of the Manifesto itself, demonstrations were planned. On the 22nd of April, the biggest demonstration was held, the Helsinki Demonstration. Lead by students, the most active group in the demonstartions, they marched to the Senators' houses, who did not support the establishment of the committee. Even though some of the students were against the demonstration, as they feared repercussions, they were overwhelmed by the students that supported the demonstration."
 finlandfocus.15.a:0 "Haista paska!"
 finlandfocus.16.t:0 "The Diet of 1863"
 finlandfocus.16.d:0 "Alexander II. has decided to summone the Finnish Diet, as he has plans for the reform of Finland. Finland is in dire need of reforms in many parts of our politics, for example in our economy and taxation system, for which the Tsar needs our estates approval. Topics which will be discussed here are the interference of the church in state matters, most notebily in the territorial and administrative matters. A great day for Finland, who gets to decide on our own matters for the first time in half a century, after the long wait following the Porvoo Diet in 1809!"
 finlandfocus.16.a:0 "Finally, the wait for autonomy is over!"
 finlandfocus.17.t:0 "Estates Representatives For Diet"
 finlandfocus.17.d:0 "With the election of the Diet now finished and the representatives gathering in the Diet, it's time to name the representatives of the 4 estates! \n\nRepresentating the nobility will: Johan Mauritz Nordenstam \nThe representative of the Klergy is: Edvard Bergenheim \nThe bailiffs are representated by: Robert Isidor Örn \nAnd at last, the peasents' represenataive is Aukusti Mäkipeska. \n\nThe Diet will start it's work soon, but whether it will be productive or not will be decided by the ability of the richer estates, especially the nobles and bailiffs, working together with the lower estates, like peasants. Their difficult relationship and their different status with one another may lead to problems, especially if one feels superior than others..."
 finlandfocus.17.a:0 "Let's hope for the best then!"
 finlandfocus.18.t:0 "The Municipal Decree of 1865"
 finlandfocus.18.d:0 "With the municipal decree of 1865, Finland ensures a strict split between the administrative borders of the municipialities and the borders the church has established in their parts. This decree makes Finland more independent from the churches, primarily from the Russian Orthodox Church and makes them more independent from Russia."
 finlandfocus.18.a:0 "Church and State split? Is that even possible...?"
 finlandfocus.19.t:0 "Last Diet's Reforms"
 finlandfocus.19.d:0 "With the language question now solved, we have to finish the last reforms over this, before our term ends. But, for all we know, that question may not appear again in the near future."
 finlandfocus.19.a:0 "Let's hope this settles this question once and for all!"
 finlandfocus.20.t:0 "The Law of Diet"
 finlandfocus.20.d:0 "During the Diet's meeting in the year 1867, there were debates about how to reform the Finnish parliamentarian system. In the end, the Finnish Diet voted for a change in the constitution that strenghthens the Diet itself. Whilst the constitution before resembeled the Swedish charta, which in turn meant that the senat did not have the right to act actively, just by proposing laws to the sovereign, this now changes due to the senat granting itself the right to decide on new laws regarding Finland."
 finlandfocus.20.a:0 "Finally, the Diet returns..."
 finlandfocus.21.t:0 "Markka - Our Own Currency"
 finlandfocus.21.d:0 "With the introduction of Markka into Finland, we have managed to establish our own currency, albeit connected to the Russian Ruble at first, before making it dependent on the silver exchange rate. To have our own currency means that we are able to take a further step towards independence!"
 finlandfocus.21.a:0 "An independent state needs his own currency!"
 finlandfocus.22.t:0 "Fennoman flag discussion"
 finlandfocus.22.d:0 "With the certain amenities of loyal service represented to the tsar, we have the opportunity to choose a new flag to represent the current political standing within our nation, what shall we choose? Keep the current one or adopt a new one?"
 finlandfocus.22.a:0 "Lets keep the current one"
 finlandfocus.22.b:0 "Actually.. On the other hand... I like this one"
 finlandfocus.23.t:0 "Svecoman flag discussion"
 finlandfocus.23.d:0 "With the certain amenities of loyal service represented to the tsar, we have the opportunity to choose a new flag to represent the current political standing within our nation, what shall we choose? Keep the current one or adopt a new one?"

 finland.14.d:0 "Originally, the waters of the Suvanto, a 40 kilometre-long lake in Viipuri Province, gently flowed into the Vuoksi River through the Kiviniemi waterway and emptying into the vast Lake Ladoga. In 1818, a channel had been dug to drain the spring floodwaters from the Suvanto into Lake Ladoga. However, this unexpectedly had caused the formation of a whole new river, the Taipaleenjoki. This new river has in recent years begun to drain Lake Suvanto of its contents, decreasing its water level by 7 meters and drying out the Kiviniemi waterway. Today the village of Sakkola dug a new riverbed through the Kiviniemi between the convergence of the Vuoksi River and Lake Suvanto. Unfortunately, this has inadvertently caused the stream to reverse in direction, causing the formation of a new river rapid called the Vuoksi Falls and rendering the navigation of the Kiviniemi impossible."
