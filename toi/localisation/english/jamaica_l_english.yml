 DCI_jamaica.1.t: "Morant Bay Trial"
 DCI_jamaica.1.d: "A black man was put on trial in the Morant Bay courthouse, charged with trespassing on a long-abandoned sugar plantation. The poor black Jamaicans of the parish were angered by this additional example of land inequality, and marched on the courthouse under the leadership of Bogle.\n\nAlthough the march was peaceful, the proceedings were disrupted when James Geoghegon, a black spectator, angrily denounced the charges. In the police's attempts to seize him and remove him from the courthouse, a fight broke out between the police and other spectators. While pursuing Geoghegon, two policemen were beaten with sticks and stones thrown from the crowd. The local authorities will most likely convict Geoghegon and send him to prison.\n\nDomestic affairs like this are typically handled by local officials, but we have the opportunity to intervene here if we can afford to pull a few strings."
 DCI_jamaica.1.a: "We cant be bothered with domestic incidents, ignore the issue."
 DCI_jamaica.1.b: "Geoghegon only expressed his opinion, intervene in this biased trial!"
 
 DCI_jamaica.2.t: "Morant Bay Trial Aftermath"
 DCI_jamaica.2.d: "The trial continued and Geoghegon was convicted and imprisoned. The following Monday the court issued arrest warrants for several men for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police.\n\nAmong those warrants was one issued directing the arrest preacher Paul Bogle. The police were unable to arrest Bogle because of the interference by his followers."
 DCI_jamaica.2.a: "Oh"
 
 DCI_jamaica.3.t: "Morant Bay Trial Aftermath"
 DCI_jamaica.3.d: "The trial continued and Geoghegon was unfortunately convicted but his sentences where reduced and no further warrants issued as a result of our influence. The policemen where released with no charges, despite arbitrarily seizing Geoghegon for protesting."
 DCI_jamaica.3.a: "At least some good came from it..."
 
 jamaica.1.t: "Morant Bay Rebellion"
 jamaica.1.d: "The Morant Bay Protest started out in southeastern [689.GetName], who were protesting racial injustice, widespread poverty, and high poll taxes.\n\nThis then turned into an insurrection when several hundred Jamaican peasant-laborers marched into the town of Morant Bay, the capital of the predominantly sugar-growing parish of St. Thomas in the East. They then raided the police station and stole the weapons stored there. The crowd then began pelting the militia with rocks and sticks, and the militia opened fire on the protesters. This angered the crowd, who reacted violently, burning the court house and nearby buildings. More than 25 people were killed on both sides, before the militia retreated. For the next two days, the mass of rebellious black peasants took over the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-East.\n\nThe response of local authorities is to end this swiftly by suppressing the revolt and it's leaders. The only question remains, what shall we do about this insurrection?"
 jamaica.1.a: "Ignore the issue and let the local authorities handle this insurrection."
 jamaica.1.b: "The revolt will end if we appease some of their demands for racial equality."
 
 jamaica.2.t: "Morant Bay Rebellion Aftermath"
 jamaica.2.d: "According to one soldier, 'we slaughtered all before us ... man or woman or child'. In the end, the soldiers killed 439 black Jamaicans directly, and they arrested 354 more (including Paul Bogle), who were later executed, many without proper trials. Bogle was executed \"either the same evening he was tried or the next morning\". Bogle was hanged alongside 14 others, including his brother Moses.\n\nOther punishments included flogging of more than 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences. The soldiers burned thousands of homes belonging to black Jamaicans without any justifiable reason, leaving families homeless throughout the parish. This was the most severe suppression of unrest in the history of the British West Indies, exceeding incidents during slavery years."
 jamaica.2.a: "This is horrendous!"
 
 DCI_jamaica.4.t: "Morant Bay Rebellion Aftermath"
 DCI_jamaica.4.d: "After the [OWNER.GetAdjective] government assured the insurrectionists that their demands would be met, peace talks began. While not every demand could be met, popularity of social egalitarianism is on the rise."
 DCI_jamaica.4.a: "This should reduce the chance of revolts for the time being."
 
 DCI_jamaica.5.t: "The Jamaican Committee"
 DCI_jamaica.5.d: "Opponents of Eyre established the Jamaica Committee in 1866, which called for Eyre to be tried for mass murder. More radical members of the Committee wanted him tried for the murder of British subjects, such as George William Gordon, under the rule of law, stating that Eyre's actions taken under the aegis of martial law were illegal.\n\nDomestic affairs like this are typically handled by local officials, but we have the opportunity to intervene here if we can afford to pull a few strings."
 DCI_jamaica.5.a: "Let the Jamaican Committee handle this trial, we cant be bothered."
 DCI_jamaica.5.b: "Justice must be had, ensure there is a trial!"
 
 DCI_jamaica.6.t: "Jamaican Committee Aftermath"
 DCI_jamaica.6.d: "When Eyre returned to [OWNER.GetName], his supporters held a banquet in his honor while opponents condemned him as a murderer that same evening. Twice Eyre was charged with murder, but the cases never proceeded to trial."
 DCI_jamaica.6.a: "There was never a trial?! This is outrageous!"
 
 DCI_jamaica.7.t: "Jamaican Committee Aftermath"
 DCI_jamaica.7.d: "The Jamaican Committee was changed to include the Jamaican peasantry. At the conclusion of the trial, Eyre was charged with murder and hanged by the gallows the next day."
 DCI_jamaica.7.a: "So ends that man's tyranny!"
 
 jamaica.3.t: "Kingston Rebellion"
 #jamaica.3.d: "After Eyre's arrest and the instability from Morant Bay, a group of Jamaican rebels organized a revolt against the local provisional government. They have called for equal rights, independence and were met by fire from the local authorities. Some armed themselves, capturing Kingston and some local cities, even some mayors that were of color sided with them. The small rebellion has also taken the Cayman Islands and the western part of Jamaica."
 jamaica.3.a: "We need to secure the Caribbean colonies!"
 jamaica.3.b: "For Independence! (Play as Jamaica!)"
