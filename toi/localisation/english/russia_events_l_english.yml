However during the majority of Nicholas I’s rule, the Russian Imperial government lacked the funds to construct any public library whatsoever, so it was not until today that the first public library in the oblast of Ryazan was built: The Gorky Library. Being based in the populated and influential city of Gorky, it was the clear choice, having also to due with the many wealthy and educated patrons funding the project."

	 russia.6.t: "Protests Against Vodka!"
	 russia.6.d: "Prices for alcohol have always been relatively low in Russia since the times of Ivan IV, but over the recent years that prices increased gradually. In the 1830's to 1840's prices had risen to 2-3 rubles per bucket of vodka. This money is also a price for a calf.\nNow it became even worse, as prices for vodka have risen three times as large as they were in the 1850 year. This is because Russia needs to replenish its depleted budget after the Crimean War, but also it causes instability in our states, especially among the poor. Protests against that policy originally started in Kovno Governorate, in Lithuania, where local villagers took oaths to abstain from drinking any high-degree alcohol except for "medicinal purposes". However, wine and beer are still permitted. Locals, supported by the Catholic clergy, established chapters of the Brotherhood of Sobriety, a temperance society that originated in Silesia and has support from the Pope himself. That was at the end of the 1858 year\nFew months ago the situation has become even worse - peasants all around the Empire are taking oaths of abstention from vodka. Boycotts were in 91 uyezds (an area that is part of the governorate) of 32 governorates. Sales of alcohol dramatically decreased, with vodka prices dropped in 16-20 times and retailers sometimes offering vodka for free. Now members of temperance societies attack taverns and destroy alcohol stockpiles. This is going beyond the borders of good and bad..."

It slowly was boiling since the Manifesto of Emperor Alexander II from March 19, 1856, when the greater agrarian reforms were promised but the implementation was slow, and in this month peasants from the Mahtra estate in Estonia revolted against our rule! Troops were sent to bring back order..."
     russia.8.a: "What? A peasant revolt? Are we in Pugachev times again?"

     russia.9.t: "Mahtra War Ends!"
     russia.9.d: "Nearly two months ago a peasant unrest caused a rebellion against the Tsar in the Estonian governorate on the Mahtra estate. It has been handled by the regular garrison army, resulting 14 wounded and 7 casualites, with 3 of the wounded later dying from fatal wounds. A battle is not without our own loss: Our company suffered some casualties—13 wounded soldiers and 1 killed officer. 60 of 65 peasant defendants were sentenced to death by our court-martial in Tallinn, but later Baltic governor-general Suvorov reduced the sentences of 44 peasants to corporal punishment; 35 of whom were sentenced to leave to Siberia in exile; and the remaining 21 rebels released off all charges. This revolt was crushed easily by our army, but what says the next one will occur in a more densely-populated city, like Moscow. . .?

Now the Soul Tax became mostly obsolete even in a modernized state. Hence why the government is adamantly pushing to discuss it with the respective Zemstvos of the Russian Governorates. Half support graduating from lower to higher income tax which will be levied upon all the population and will leave the tax income on state budget the same, the outcome being peasants and commoners living better in cost of nobility cash. Some other commissions supported the usual income tax, but only for merchants, and some additional taxes on the nobility and peasants. The idea barley made it through, as it was laughed at due to its ineffectiveness, with the central government shutting it down almost immediately. Finally, one more proposal: property taxes instead of both soul and income taxes. If you have much property but a low income you should sell a portion of your items to have overall lower taxes. All things will be levied with those new taxes, from spoons to great estates spanning kilometers. This is an unpopular and very untraditional proposal but it gained support through the economically competent people in our realm. Maybe we should listen to them. Or we can just drop all the initiative and suffer the consequences of an inefficient tax policy. The Nobility would be pleased with that."
	 russia.20.a: "Let's not rush to do this..."

	 russiavicfocus.1.d: "Over the past few months, the Russian Empire has seen a substantial amount of German migrants settling in the Volga Region east of Moscow.

	 russiavicfocus.2.d: "The Crimean War was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to February 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain, and Sardinia. The war started in the Balkans in July 1853, when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities, which were under Ottoman suzerainty, then began to cross the Danube. Led by Omar Pasha, the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the advance at Silistra. The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts in which the military used modern technologies such as explosive naval shells, railways, and telegraphs. The war was one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and photographs. As the legend of the "Charge of the Light Brigade" demonstrates, the war quickly became an iconic symbol of logistical, medical and tactical failures and mismanagement."

The reforms carried on during Milyutin's long tenure abolished the system where children were conscripted and resulted in the levy system being introduced in Russia and military districts being created across the country. The system of military education was also reformed, and elementary education was made available to all the draftees. Milyutin's reforms are regarded as a milestone in the history of Russia: they dispensed with the military recruitment and professional army introduced by Peter the Great and created the Russian army as it continued into the 21st century. Up to Dmitry Milyutin's reforms in 1874, the Russian Army had no permanent barracks and was billeted in dugouts and shacks."

Sacking him for a replacement could prove wise to prevent separatism or calls for federalist reform but it might cause uproar or instability in the region for years to come."

	 russia.22.d: "'Russian Bulletin' has sent its new March-April issue to the Censor Department. That would be a usual publication if it hadn't the new Turgenev's novel inside, called 'Fathers and Sons'. Its idea is rotating around nihilism, an ideology of denial of every authority and even somewhat revolutionary! It can be dangerous enough for our aristocracy which already supports liberal ideas. We can give the order - and this book will be completely different, but Turgenev will be completely disappointed in our government. He is one of the most loyal writers of our Motherland and it would be a tall loss. But what if we go soft with this novel and just let it be? Of course, there will be some mimics who will call themselves 'nihilists', but... isn't it what we want to make them think? Just ensure that they are loyal, being initiative and innovative isn't a crime in Russia."
	 russia.22.a: "Let's not be strict, it's not the Nikolay era after all."
	 russia.22.b: "Better censure this 'nihilism', else we can suffer from crazy idealists raised on that book..."

	russia.23.d: "When the novel about Evgeniy Bazarov has just been written by Turgenev, we decided to censor it heavily, remove all questionable themes and never return to this. But due to the end of the Censor Department, following the new law about the press, the real book has been revealed! Now people are blaming us for hiding that 'masterpiece' from them. That led to us losing some positions in government and, what is worrying - 'nihilism' starts to spread through our population!"

	russia.24.t: "Publishment of 'Crime and Punishment'"
	russia.24.d: "Fyodor Dostoevsky has written a new book, called 'Crime and Punishment'. It tells about a poor Russian student, Rodion Raskolnikov, who tries to survive in Saint Petersburg and lends his old but only kettle to the old woman, who was a money lender. He says that this is unfair and kills her along with her silly-minded sister and then tries to merge his philosophy theory about 'the ones who have the right and the ones who don't' with the fact of murder. When he founds his love and starts a more active life, meeting many people, his conscience begins to rise slowly, leading him to surrendering to police and going to penal colony in Siberia. His love follows him and there he finally finds his salvation, throws out his ideas and starts a new life with his woman. This book, being published now in the 'Russian Bulletin', is close to the title of masterpiece and doesn't really tell about any political ideas, so we can just let it be."
	russia.24.a: "Worth of reading in spare time - Dostoevsky wrote a good piece!"
	 
	russiasiberiancolonization.5.t: "'Oblastnichestvo' Rises!"
	russiasiberiancolonization.5.d: "When Siberian students named Grigory Potanin, Nikolay Yadrintsev, Serafim Shashkov, Nikolay Naumov, Fyodor Usov and other ones came to St. Petersburg in the early 60-s, they immediately created an idea of Siberian independence or 'at least' autonomy for their region. They returned home in 1863, immediately establishing contacts with political prisoners and Polish people who were exiled after their recent rebellion. They were gathering forces and money to incite revolt in Siberia, but at this summer, in the year 1865, their plot was uncovered. Forty four members of the group were arrested and taken to prison by the Russian government in May after watch officers of the Siberian Cadet Corps searched cadet Arseny Samsonov, aged 16, for illicit items and found a proclamation entitled 'To Patriots of Siberia,' attributed to collective authorship of G. Potanin, N. Yadrintsev and other leaders of the movement. Now all of them were sent to various places around the empire for either penal labour or exile, ensuring that we won't hear of them revolting again. Their ideas got some foothold within minds of local bourgeois in Tomsk, Tobolsk and Irkutsk, but that doesn't matter, because no one questions Russian authority in those lands anymore."

    russiavicfocus.23.d: "The Russian Empire instituted the Lithuanian Press Ban to ensure that the Russian Empire could stifle any chances of Lithuanian and, by extension, Polish nationalism from growing. Having all books are written in the Latin script also approved to be written in the Cyrillic Russian/Ukrainian or “Little Russian” script. These writings had to be approved by the VCC (Vilnius Censorship Committee), which also oversaw the censorship of other cities within the Northwestern region of the Russian Empire extending to the countries of Latvia, Estonia, and Western Belarus extending out into Minsk. This Ban was also used as an attempt at the Russification of the Baltic States."
