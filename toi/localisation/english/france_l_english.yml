 FRA_decision_enact_loi_ollivier:0 "Enact the Olliver Law"
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_ollivier_desc:0 "Proposed by the liberal politician Émile Ollivier, this law will allow the repeal of the 1791 law Le Chapellier that made the rallying of peasants and workers illegal. Viewed as a first step towards a friendlier government for the poor class, its enactment will calm down the republicans and the socialist movement."
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_duruy:0 "Enact the Duruy Law"
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_duruy_desc:0 "The law proposed by Victor Duruy aims to improve schooling. After debate the law content is the following :\n- Obligation to have an elementary school in all towns with more 500 inhabitants (800 in the Falloux Law 1850)\n- Improvement of the teacher salaries\n- The towns, the Departments and France can finance elementary otherwise the parents pay to send their children.\n- Authorisation of towns to give money to hardworking children to improve school frequentation (school stays facultative to keep father liberty).\n- History and Geography are mandatory"
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_niel:0 "Enact the Niel Law"
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_niel_desc:0 "The War Minister, the Marshal Adolphe Niel shares with Napoleon III the admiration of the Prussian military administration. In Prussia all men between 20 and 40 must do military service. In France, conscription is still done by lottery and the rich can pay other to serve in their place to avoid it. Even if the number of active soldiers of both countries are comparable, the French Army must divide its soldiers between colonies and the reserve is not ready to fight. Adolphe Niel estimated that there are 200,000 French soldiers who can defend the Rhine against up to 350,000 Prussians (double with the reserve). Adolphe Niel proposed the \"Garde Nationale mobile\" a copy of the Prussian military system, but the people and the deputies don’t want it."

 FRA_latin_monetary_union_establishment:0 "Founding Treaty of Latin Monetary Union"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_establishment_desc:0 "France is, as all other nations, dependent on the exchange of trade between peoples. In the recognition of this truth, an interesting proposition has come forth from within trade commissions and economic circles...\n\nA typical inconvenience in international trade are unfixed exchange rates between currencies, as each currency follows its own standards of minting, weighing and metal composition. This leads to exchange uncertainty, as a trader in France may not get the value of goods for the weight of his coin abroad. Thusly, a proposal for a so-called 'Monetary Union' has been presented.\n\nThis 'Union' would, if agreed upon by other nations, standardize exchange rates between nations. This would make it so that coins from abroad can be exchanged for the French Franc at a set equal value, per bimetallic standard, both ways. This would make trade a much simpler and effective affair, but requires some fellow nations to participate... shall we form this Monetary Union?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_greece:0 "Ask Greece to join us!"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_greece_desc:0 "The Greeks have expressed an interest in joining the LMU, citing one of the clauses of the treaty which allows nations willing to abide by the treaty's stipulations to join the union's member states. The Kingdom of Greece lies in a valuable position to contest the waters along the Bosphorus, and letting them into the union may work just as much as a diplomatic move as an economic one... shall Greece enter the Monetary Union?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_russia:0 "Bilateral agreement with Russia"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_russia_desc:0 "While St. Petersburg has expressed no desire in joining the treaty, the interest of the equal exchange concept has not fallen on deaf ears it seems. A separate agreement may be able to be struck, however, but with exchange rates being standardized from banks of the member unions in relation to the Bank of Russia, with regards to fiscal and monetary notes. This agreement, while different, could make trade simpler for our partners in Russia."
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_spain:0 "Bilateral agreement with Spain"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_spain_desc:0 "Spain is doubtful of the implications of the treaty, and negotiations have thusfar been fruitless despite interest in the concept. A bilateral agreement might be beneficial as a replacement to union membership, even if the agreement has to be slightly slanted to the Spaniards..."
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_romania:0 "Bilateral agreement with Romania"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_romania_desc:0 "The newly founded nation of the Romani people have expressed an interest in our currency union, and is willing to enter as a member. However, disagreements in treaty application and organization has lead to unsuccessful negotiations, and Romania remains outside the agreement. Despite the concessions, perhaps we can persuade the Romanians with a modified bilateral agreement?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_austria_hungary:0 "Bilateral agreement with Austria-Hungary"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_austria_hungary_desc:0 "Vienna has expressed a clear rejection of the LMU treaty and its stipulations, reasoning that a bimetallic monetary system is not appealing to their economic interests, as their own system is that of a monometallic monetary system. Maybe we could persuade them with an agreement of equal exchange between our gold Francs and their Florin between treasuries?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_monaco:0 "Bilateral agreement with Monaco"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_monaco_desc:0 "Our small neighbour in the south, Monaco, is tied to us in a way that is inseverable. They do not want a full membership in our union, but have expressed a positive desire to make use of the LMU standard for trade between currencies. An agreement would be most beneficial for us both."
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_serbia:0 "Unilateral agreement with Serbia"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_serbia_desc:0 "The Serbians are not interested in participating directly in the union and its exchanges, but has shown to want to make use of the LMU standard for coin minting. While we can't make them abide by our standardization and exchange rate due to metal percentages being different, we could perhaps set special exchange rates between their standard and ours?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_bulgaria:0 "Unilateral agreement with Bulgaria"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_bulgaria_desc:0 "Bulgaria, much like Serbia, does not want to enter the union but does want to use the LMU standardization of minting. We could make a unilateral agreement which would exchange union currency at a rate which is equal to the value of the Bulgarian coins; all we need to know is if the Bulgarian's will agree to this or not..."

But in this century, its population has increased greatly, and now suburbs have appeared all around it, inside the Wall of Thiers, built in 1840. Haussmann had in his plan to expand the city to this wall, incorporating those small communities and redoing entirely the map of Paris' Arrondissements.

In 1821 Alexis Bouvard have gathered 40 years of observations but didn’t succeed to fix the model by supposing the addition of an unknown planet. The British John Couch Adams worked on it but it was the French Urbain Le Verrier which computed the orbit of this unknown planet in 1845. The Prussian Johann Gottfried Galle observed the planet in 1846 which will be called Neptune. Urbain Le Verrier tried to do the same thing do explain anomalies with Mercury orbit. In 1859, a doctor an amateurish astronom, Edmond Modeste Lescarbault sent a letter to Le Verrier to report an observation of a corps. Le Verrier announce this year that it is a planet and gives it the name Vulcan.  We expect further observations will confirm the 9th planet which is between Mercury and the sun."

We can listen to this ultimatum, and back down from our expansion. We also can fight the Prussians, our army might not be in the best of shapes but the Prussian army are also very disorganized, and the North German alliance is still fresh."

 latin_monetary_union.1.t:0 "Establishment of Latin Monetary Union"
 latin_monetary_union.1.d:0 "Today, the governments of France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland have made a joint statement addressing the conclusion of discussions, and the founding of a new treaty union: The Latin Monetary Union.\n\nThe Latin Monetary Union, abreviated as the LMU, seeks to unify the currency of each member-state under one standardized system of mintage. This system makes the exchange rates of coinage between the members Italy, Switzerland, Belgium and France equal. This meaning the coins are united in value and are usable without conversion in all member nations, as long as the dimensions, weight and metal compositions remain mostly identical. The Union was a proposal made by French officials, and its founding would suggest a closer cooperation between each member-state's and French economic interests in Europe.\n\nWhat will become of this union over the ages, only time will tell..."
 latin_monetary_union.1.a:0 "A union is born!"
 latin_monetary_union.2.t:0 "Ask Greece to join Latin Monetary Union"
 latin_monetary_union.2.d:0 "Our diplomats to Greece have reported a possibility to invite the Greeks into joining the FMU.\n\nFeelers among the diplomatic corps sent to Greece have gotten positive impressions of the potential prospects of a Greek entry into the FMU, and believe that giving them a direct invitation might be a good way to give off a good impression about the LMU. The Greeks are generally positive about the stipulations of the treaty, and have shown an definitive interest in the coinage standardization which the LMU offers, besides the currency having the strength of the other members economic backing.\n\nThere are many potential benefits for the Greeks if they decide to fully enter the monetary union, however, the decision ultimately falls to them."
 latin_monetary_union.2.a:0 "Send our greetings!"
 latin_monetary_union.3.t:0 "Bilateral agreement with Latin Monetary Union"
 latin_monetary_union.3.d:0 "We do not agree with all the stipulations that the LMU imposes if we were to join as a full member, thusly making the treaty undesirable for our continued interest.\n\nHowever, while we aren't interested in joining the LMU as a full member-state it would still be prudent and a definitive necessity to interact with it on an economic basis. The standardizing of mintage and coinage is an appealing idea, but perhaps there are other ways of making a set exchange rate for our treasury or currency in relations to the LMU?\n\nThis way we could trade with the LMU on more equal terms without joining the union in full."
 latin_monetary_union.3.a:0 "A bilateral agreement is desirable"
 latin_monetary_union.3.b:0 "We do not want this"
 latin_monetary_union.4.t:0 "Unilateral agreement with Latin Monetary Union"
 latin_monetary_union.4.d:0 "The LMU system of coinage is an interesting idea which could be used to our advantage, despite us not being interested in the treaty. Perhaps we could make our own standard of exchange by the LMU system for our own purposes, while getting an agreement to make use of such a system in relation to exchange rates to the LMU and other associates with similar systems? This would give us the advantage of making a coinage which is usable for trade across many nations in Europe, while being more tailored to our own purposes."
 latin_monetary_union.4.a:0 "Standardization it is!"
 latin_monetary_union.4.b:0 "Our existing coins are sufficient"

#FRANCO PRUSSIAN WAR

 third_rep_france.001.t:0 "Proclamation of the Third Republic"
 third_rep_france.001.d:0 "After the capture of Napoleon in Sedan, the deputies gathered urgently at the Bourbon Palace to decide the fate of the nation. However, under the pressure of the crowd gathered in front of the Palace, Leon Gambetta, from the top of the Town Hall, solemnly proclaimed today the birth of a new republic."
 third_rep_france.001.a:0 "Vive la République !"

 third_rep_france.002.t:0 "The Establishment of the Gouvernement Provisoire"
 third_rep_france.002.d:0 "To lead the nation against the Prussian invasion, a new "Government of National Defense", leaded by the General Trochu, have been created to lead our army and our country."
 third_rep_france.002.a:0 "We will follow his decisions"

 third_rep_france.0021.t:0 "Socialist influence is growing in France"
 third_rep_france.0021.d:0 "In this troubled period, organizations are forming everywhere in France to support the most disadvantaged, as in the capital where Republican Central Committee of the Twenty Arrondissements tries to obtain from the new government political and social measures favorable to the popular classes."
 third_rep_france.0021.a:0 "Let's keep an eye on them"

 third_rep_france.003.t:0 "Fortification of the capital"
 third_rep_france.003.d:0 "The Prussian army is advancing towards the capital, and the Parisians must prepare for the siege of the city. Fortune barricades are installed on the edge of the Seine, the bridges are blocked and the suburbs monitored"
 third_rep_france.003.a:0 "Here we go Again"

 third_rep_france.004.t:0 "Canons for the Parisians"
 third_rep_france.004.d:0 "In these times of crisis, the Parisians joined forces to buy cannons with their money to defend their city from the German invader. These weapons may help repel the enemy."
 third_rep_france.004.a:0 "These cannons will be of great help"

 third_rep_france.005.t:0 "The Parisian National Guard joigned the front"
 third_rep_france.005.d:0 "All registered voters of the city of Paris are summoned. The National Guards, numbering 590,000 soldiers, were mobilized for the rest of the war and sent en masse to the front. They also participate in the defense of Paris."
 third_rep_france.005.a:0 "All citizens must fight"

 third_rep_france.006.t:0 "The Siege of Paris"
 third_rep_france.006.d:0 "The French Army has been unable to stop the Prussian advance, and now, they surround the capital completely. This siege was something the generals knew was going to happen, but like often during this war the ineffectiveness and lack of preparation from the Army will lead to difficult times for the Parisians.\n\nHopefully, the Prussians will be pushed back soon enough."
 third_rep_france.006.a:0 "This is not over !"

 third_rep_france.007.t:0 "Entrevue de Ferrières"
 third_rep_france.007.d:0 "The war is now over for us. We have lost, and the Prussians crushed us under the might of their united German army. It is time to call the Prussian high command, and to discuss the terms for peace.\n\nThe location was chosen to be the Ferrières Castle, east of Paris. It will, and has, to stay secret, to protect the stability of the new French government, and to assure that the terms discussed will be debated fairly. The Prussian chancellor and the French foreign ministers will discuss the terms for peace, and hopefully, they will find something both sides can agree on."
 third_rep_france.007.a:0 "We hope to bring peace"

 third_rep_france.0071.t:0 "Entrevue de Ferrières"
 third_rep_france.0071.d:0 "We have received a message from the newly formed French government, we have finally made them bend the knee. Confronted to the might of the German armies, they have now asked us to discuss peace in the Ferrières Castle near Paris. This discussion with the French foreign minister will let us push our demands.\n\nWe have for decades longed for the time we could retake the lands of Alsace-Lorraine, German lands which we are legitimate to claim. On top of that, we could use the opportunity to strengthen our German unity. Beating the French Empire is a gift on its own, but this the closest we expect to have from a capitulation. We have our demands, and they'll have to accept it."
 third_rep_france.0071.a:0 "The war needs to cease, we won already after all"

 third_rep_france.0072.t:0 "Entrevue de Ferrières"
 third_rep_france.0072.d:0 "The Prussian chancellor has agreed to peace, but with horrendous terms. We shall renounce to the territory of Alsace-Lorraine, which will be transferred to the Kingdom of Prussia. Peace is vital for France, the war has destroyed a lot of lives already, but these terms are very restraining and may be problematic. But we must do what's needed to save France from an ever growing disaster. We must agree to these terms. But first, we must prepare ourselves from what might come. Let us take the time to carefully think about these terms."
 third_rep_france.0072.a:0 "Sacrifices must be made"
 third_rep_france.0072.b:0 "No way we accept the conditions"

 third_rep_france.008.t:0 "Léon Gambetta leaves Paris in a balloon"
 third_rep_france.008.d:0 "The siege of Paris won't stop our politicians from organizing the rest of the nation! The new Minister of the Interior, the socialist Léon Gambetta, has jumped into a balloon to quit the city. The aim of such a surprising move, is to organize the French Army that are awaiting orders from the government since the start of the siege.\n\nWhat could be seen as an extravagant and excentric way of leaving a city, is in reality probably the best way for him to leave, and to go behind enemy lines. Of course this isn't without risk, but Gambetta is the type of politician that would risk being shot by a Prussian, if it's to save the nation."
 third_rep_france.008.a:0 "At least it must be fun"

 third_rep_france.0081.t:0 "Government delegation sent in Tours"
 third_rep_france.0081.d:0 "The government having chosen to remain in Paris surrounded by Prussian troops and their allies, a delegation was sent to Tours to coordinate the action in the provinces under the orders of Adolphe Crémieux, Minister of Justice, accompanied by Alexandre Glais-Bizoin and Admiral Fourichon."
 third_rep_france.0081.a:0 "Hope they manage to turn the situation around"

 third_rep_france.0082.t:0 "Government delegation retreat in Bordeaux"
 third_rep_france.0082.d:0 "The Prussian advance forced the government delegation installed in the city of Tours to withdraw this morning further south to Bordeaux. Although the capital manages to repel the invaders who have besieged the city for several months now, the situation in the countryside portends the worst ..."
 third_rep_france.0082.a:0 "This is our last chance..."

 third_rep_france.0083.t:0 "Government delegation captured in Bordeaux !"
 third_rep_france.0083.d:0 "It's a catastrophe! Without warning, in the middle of the night, the Prusian army made a Perseus in the French defense and entered the city of Bordeaux where the government delegation was now prisoners of the Prussians! The signing of the armistice should be concluded in the afternoon ..."
 third_rep_france.0083.a:0 "This is the end !"

 third_rep_france.009.t:0 "Insurrections in Paris"
 third_rep_france.009.d:0 "The siege continues, and the people are getting tired of the poor performance of the newly formed government. A recent streak of military losses, due to a lack of long term planning and quick response tactics, has prompted new insurrections in the capital. Charles Delescluze has called in his newspaper to form the Commune, and to fight against the government.\n\nThis small scale uprising won't topple our government, but it has been the rallying cause for a few of our government members, like Léon Gambetta and Henri Rochefort. Rochefort wants us to accept this uprising as a normal response to a time of crisis, and let them continue. The army however, don't want to deal with internal threats at the same time as the Prussian Army."
 third_rep_france.009.a:0 "Put down this insurrection"

 third_rep_france.0101.t:0 "The Government won the plebiscite"
 third_rep_france.0101.d:0 "The Parisians have spoken! The Government of National Defense obtained a large majority in the vote and will be able to continue the fight !"
 third_rep_france.0101.a:0 "We will not fail !"

 third_rep_france.0102.t:0 "The Government loose the plebiscite"
 third_rep_france.0102.d:0 "The Parisians have spoken! The national defense government did not obtain the majority in the vote. General Trochu is expected to decide the fate of the government very soon."
 third_rep_france.0102.a:0 "This is the End"

 third_rep_france.0103.t:0 "Louis Jules Trochu steps down"
 third_rep_france.0103.d:0 "Another day, another demonstration in Paris. France has suffered again and again losses on the battlefield, and the government continues to resist the terms given by the Prussians for peace. However, these past few days have been too much for general Trochu. He has today announced his resignation from the government. The last resistant against the Prussian agreement is now gone, and the government prepares itself to sign the peace deal."
 third_rep_france.0103.a:0 "Looks like it is the End..."

 third_rep_france.0104.t:0 "French Army Defeated"
 third_rep_france.0104.d:0 "If the republican armies have been able until today to limit the Prussian advance as much as possible, today the battle took place which will seal the tragic fate of this war which has cost France so much ..."
 third_rep_france.0104.a:0 "Looks like it is the End..."

 third_rep_france.0105.t:0 "Paris Falls!"
 third_rep_france.0105.d:0 "National-Defense Government captured in Paris!"
 third_rep_france.0105.a:0 "Looks like it is the End..."

 third_rep_france.011.t:0 "Armistice signed between France and Prussia!"
 third_rep_france.011.d:0 "After months of back and forth from the French government, the armistice has been signed. During the next few days, Legislative Elections will be organized and the two countries will have to find a definitive peace agreement which will finally ends the Franco-Prussian War. At least, if everything goes as planned ..."
 third_rep_france.011.a:0 "Finally, peace...."

 third_rep_france.0111.t:0 "The Prussian army marches through Paris"
 third_rep_france.0111.d:0 "Today, as stipulated in the preliminary armistice agreement, Prussian troops marched through the streets of the French capital, to the amazement and disappointment of the Parisians, feeling the event as a real insult, reinforcing their feeling of to have been betrayed by their leaders."
 third_rep_france.0111.a:0 "What a shame !"

 third_rep_france.0112.t:0 "Our army marches through Paris"
 third_rep_france.0112.d:0 "Today, as stipulated in the preliminary armistice agreement, Prussian troops marched through the streets of the French capital, to the amazement and disappointment of the Parisians, feeling the event as a real insult, reinforcing their feeling of to have been betrayed by their leaders."
 third_rep_france.0112.a:0 "A great day for the Empire"

 third_rep_france.012.t:0 "Léon Gambetta quits the government"
 third_rep_france.012.d:0 "Léon Gambetta was one of the strongest opponant to the Paris plebiscite, and now that the government has voiced their full support of it he has deposed his letter of resignation from the French government. He was one of the most charismatic voices of the French Republic, since the days of the Empire. Now that he's gone, we can expect some very angry socialists politicians to oppose the government. We had hoped that the plebiscite would have calmed the people, it might have very well create more chaos."
 third_rep_france.012.a:0 "Good riddance"

 third_rep_france.013.t:0 "Henri Rochefort quits the government"
 third_rep_france.013.d:0 "The passionate Henri Rochefort has deposed his letter of resignation following our order to send the army to pacificy the recent insurrections. Rochefort was a great voice, bridging the gap between the communist Blanquists and the moderate government. While he often went against our main republican lines, he still was an important figure of the French Republic. But we don't need authoritarians in our new government, and Rochefort's departure will not make our job any harder than what it already is."
 third_rep_france.013.a:0 "Good riddance"

# 1871 LEGISLATIVE ELECTION

 third_rep_france.014.t:0 "First Legislative Election of the Republic"
 third_rep_france.014.d:0 "A glorious day for the republic, it's election time! These elections will decide the landscape of our first Parliament, giving an advantage to one of the four major parties present in France and powerful enough to have representatives.\n\nThe Legitimists are the monarchists, supporters of the return to a more classical French monarchy. This party has lots of supporters among the conservative circles, but isn't very popular among the population. The Modérés are, like their name suggest, more moderate conservatives. Supporters of the republic, they still have very conservative views and politics. The Liberals are centrist politicians, who are keen to pleasing everyone. Keeping stability in the new republic might not be a bad idea after all. Finally, the Radicals are socialist poltilicans, pushing for a more centralized economy and for a more welfare-centric nation. Extremly popular, it is also a party that could calm down the recent problems we have with communists insurgencies."
 third_rep_france.014.a:0 "It's democracy time."

 third_rep_france.0141.t:0 "Monarchists won the Election."
 third_rep_france.0141.d:0 "If the election seemed to oppose Monarchists, composed of the Legitimists, Orléanists and the Napoleonians, and Republicans, it was ultimately aimed at deciding the future of the conflict between pacifist monarchists and Republicans in favor of total war. Exhausted by several long months of conflict, the French finally chose peace."
 third_rep_france.0141.a:0 "The start of a new era"

 third_rep_france.015.t:0 "Adolphe Thiers elected President"
 third_rep_france.015.d:0 ""

 third_rep_france.15.t:0 "Resentment in Paris"
 third_rep_france.15.d_thiers:0 "Adolphe Thiers has been in French politics for years before becoming the President. During the July Monarchy, he erected what was later called the "Thiers Wall" to protect the city from invaders following the 1848 revolution. Not only that, but he also has shown some resentment towards the National Guards, fearing that they might rise up to oust him. Now his fears might become true. Rumors are going around that they are planning to take over the government. They are socialists at heart, the very young republic might get destroyed once again, we cannot let that happen."
 third_rep_france.15.d_gambetta:0 "Léon Gambetta is a popular figure, both for the republicans and the socialists. He is charismatic, and has made clear that nobody is going to stop his societal reforms following his election. But both the Military and the Socialists want to be assured of his policies. The military fears that he'll be too liberal, the socialist fear that he will be too conservative to please the majority. Léon Gambetta is in a tough position, and has to choose which faction he wants to help, and which faction he needs to betray."
 third_rep_france.15.d_rochefort:0 "The first President of our new Republic is not the most popular one among our socialist peers. Henri Rochefort has shown himself to be a quite ruthless and authoritarian leader, and on top of that someone who frequent Auguste Blanqui, a known hard-line marxist. The French army has already expressed their worries about this new ruler, and Patrice de Mac-Mahon has become the most prominent opponent to Rochefort among the military. Intelligence reports show the suspicious behavior of some of our war veterans."
 third_rep_france.15.a:0 "Confiscate the National Guard's cannons"
 third_rep_france.15.b:0 "Let's meet both of them"
 third_rep_france.15.c:0 "Talk with the Blanquists"
 third_rep_france.15.d:0 "Everything's fine"

 third_rep_france.16.t:0 "The [GetDateText] Uprising"
 third_rep_france.16.d:0 "Recent governmental decisions were unsatisfying for parts of the Army. The recent confiscation of the guns of our National Guard, in the hopes of controlling a situation that would have spiraled down, has made them join the socialist cause. Reports are talking about an insurrection, but lot of experts in the government are already talking about a revolution.\n\nBrace yourself Paris, the struggle is far from being over."
 third_rep_france.16.a:0 "It has begun"

 third_rep_france.17.t:0 "The [GetDateText] Military Uprising"
 third_rep_france.17.d:0 "Following the arrest of Patrice de Mac-Mahon, parts of our miltiary have risen up against our government and has declared war on our régime. Their headquarters are in Bordeaux, and they are already making offensives along the Garonne to secure their hold of Aquitaine. Our high command is completly taken by surprise, and troops are reorganized erratically with what's left of our generals and commanders. So little time after the Franco-Prussian War that humiliated France, we now have to face another conflict."
 third_rep_france.17.a:0 "France cannot escape war it seems"
 third_rep_france.17.b:0 "We cannot let the Socialists take over!"

 third_rep_france.18.t:0 "The Meeting"
 third_rep_france.18.d:0 "The communist group of Auguste Blanqui has been a pain for the French government since it was called to replace the imperial regime. However, recent problematic military moves has prompted the need for a political deal, a compromise.\n\nBlanqui proposed that we should get rid of general Patrice de Mac-Mahon. The illustrious military officier is also a staunch legitimist, and a man with great influence on the army. While we can't accuse him of conspiracy, it is true that we could remove him swiftly, resolving the problem very elegantly. However, our army is already at its weakest point in decades, some may even say centuries, and thus removing one of the most efficient military officer from our army might completly destroy us. This is an ultimatum in disguise, either we remove Mac-Mahon and face a possible military uprising, or we let him continue and we face a socialist uprising. There's no right solution here."
 third_rep_france.18.a:0 "We'll be sure to eliminate Mac-Mahon"
 third_rep_france.18.b:0 "We don't want to make our military weaker than it already is"

 third_rep_france.19.t:0 "The [GetDateText] Military Coup"
 third_rep_france.19.d:0 "The disastrous French government hasn't managed to keep its own Army under their command. In a move only outshined by the continuous conflict against Prussia, parts of the French Army, led by general Patrice de Mac-Mahon, has risen up and has called their own government of national salvation down in Aquitaine. We now have another enemy to face, our own army, and without these key miltiary commanders we are now even weaker than before."
 third_rep_france.19.a:0 "Rochefort has seen it coming"

 third_rep_france.20.t:0 "The Worries of the Socialists"
 third_rep_france.20.d:0 "The socialists have called upon us to stregthen the basics of our nascent democracy, and to protect at all cost the social liberties gained by the end of the rule of the Emperor. It is too early to make rock-strong promises, but it's probably what's needed to keep our nation in one piece. However, giving in too much to them might anger an already frustrated army."
 third_rep_france.20.a:0 "Of course, we'll stay true to our beliefs"
 third_rep_france.20.b:0 "Some sacrifices are needed to create a strong nation"
 third_rep_france.20.c:0 "The future of France is not socialist"

 third_rep_france.21.t:0 "The Worries of the Army"
 third_rep_france.21.d:0 "The army has strong conservative values, and even among the most loyal to Trochu's provisionnal government, there's a fear of leaning in too much towards the socialists. They want reassurance that the new government will protect French values and traditions, and will continue to support efforts to stregthen the army and its budget moving forward."
 third_rep_france.21.a:0 "We won't forget about our values and tradition"
 third_rep_france.21.b:0 "We trust the democratic process"
 third_rep_france.21.c:0 "We must march forward towards progress"

 third_rep_france.22.t:0 "The Socialists are happy with our decisions"
 third_rep_france.22.d:0 "After hearing both sides, and making our decisions, we have received reports that socialists leaders are generally happy with them. The internal peace gained from that might be temporary, but every day saved is a blessing considering the current state of the nation."
 third_rep_france.22.a:0 "Wonderful, we were able to reassure them"

 third_rep_france.23.t:0 "The Socialists are worried about our decisions"
 third_rep_france.23.d:0 "After hearing both sides, and making our decisions, we have received reports that socialists leaders are weary of the positions we have taken. Demonstrations are already being organized, and it seems that our move to create a fairer system might have resulted in a loss of faith from them."
 third_rep_france.23.a:0 "We cannot please everyone"

 third_rep_france.24.t:0 "General strike in Paris"
 third_rep_france.24.d:0 "The recent positions taken by the government has prompted strikes in the capital. Organized by socialists, these are targeted towards the government, who it seems cannot please them. The size of the strike is worrying though, and reports are talking about an even bigger demonstration being prepared soon. Who knows what the future holds, but the Republic isn't off to a great start."
 third_rep_france.24.a:0 "Worrying"

 third_rep_france.25.t:0 "The Army is happy with our decisions"
 third_rep_france.25.d:0 "Our positions have pleased the influential military commanders in our Army. We can't afford losing the support from our only defense against the Prussian threat, and such reports reassures the government in its actions and decisions. There might be some hope for France after all."
 third_rep_france.25.a:0 "Wonderful, we were able to reassure them"

 third_rep_france.26.t:0 "The Army is worried about our decisions"
 third_rep_france.26.d:0 "The revent decisions taken by the government about the worries of its people and army hasn't been popular among the influencial military commanders. While some are just losing their faith, others are already talking about "incompetency", and could become problematic in our ongoing conflict against the Prussians."
 third_rep_france.26.a:0 "We cannot please everyone"

 third_rep_france.27.t:0 "Military demonstrations in Paris"
 third_rep_france.27.d:0 "Is was obvious, some among the military are now refusing to fight, called our government "illegitimate" and "uneffective". Our military has been weakened enough, we don't need such demonstrations, but it seems that we have lost them for good now. Negotiations were tried, but ultimatly failed. It seems that we must live with an even more weakened Army."
 third_rep_france.27.a:0 "Worrying"
