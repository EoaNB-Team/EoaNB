However, French intelligence discovered the king of Belgium, Leopold II, attempting to covertly form a colonial state in the Congo Basin! Many European powers decided to begin colonization of their own so that no one power would control the entirety of the Dark Continent. However, the relative peace in Europe that that has been enjoyed for so long may disappear through conflicts in Africa, and the many woven threads of alliance may trigger an even larger war. A conference should probably be organized to regulate trade and colonization in Africa before the situation gets out of hand. However, it might be equally advantageous not to; we could obtain excuses for war on the European continent because of conflicts far away..."

We may have fueled the fires of colonialism there and happily supported it, but we were foolish to think conflicts would not arise. Luckily, our longtime ally, Portugal, has approached us with a plan to solve the problem. They ask us to help organize a meeting in Berlin of the great European powers and the USA to discuss the African continent, make agreements on trade through it, and ensure that wars in Europe aren't caused by disagreements in Africa. We have a few options on the handling and organization of this historic conference. We can agree completely to their proposal and attend the meeting, ask that it takes place in Paris instead (which might make the French happy), or dismiss it completely and trust in the security of our island should conflicts arise."

It had been a week since the provisional legislature of the Dakota Territories had been forced to declare independence from the rapidly crumbling 'United States'.\n\nLess than a month since the collapse had started, all from petty squabbles in the far away capital. Wilmot sighed, this position was only ever supposed to be temporary. It had not even been recognised by the US government. An official appointment had been planned by DC, but now...\n\nWilmot glanced at the paperwork spread out on the rough surface of his desk. That was definitely not happening, not after a crisis that had destroyed the union. He picked up a report on the last raid from one of the Sioux tribes. It falls to me to hold the territory together, somehow.\nHow had it come to this?"

Finally, making a decision, Wilmot spoke."

We want that which is owed, the money and rights that were promised to us and what YOUR government have reneged on again and again.'\n\n'That government is gone' Wilmont replied 'This new government offers integration.'\n\n'Integration? you think we want to be like you.' Cuts in another elder\n\n'No, i want to make a republic for both natives and Europeans, for all who call this land home.'\n\n'And we are to just believe this, after all the promises your people have made us were broken. After all the missed payments.'\n\n'And if we were to obtain those lost funds, would you join then.'\n\n'all of it?', the elders huddled together for a second, rapid words in Sioux flying back and forth. 'then that may bring the others to accept this deal.'\n\n'Then we will pay this price. On condition that you bring the others in to join us in building a republic.'\n\n'Then we await what is ours.' The Elders exit the room, leaving Wilmont to sit there and wonder where his little republic would get the funds from."

 POLITICS_AKAN_COUNCILS_DESC:0 "The Akan people are one meta-ethnicity and consider themselves to be one nation, but are made up of over thirty sub-groups and historically formed political entities on regional scale. These states, known as “Aman” in the Akan (also called Twi) language, would be ruled by kings, (“Ahemfo” in Akan) and territory would be given to various clans who ruled their respective states.\n The Akan are a matrilineal people, and in addition to tracing lineage through mothers, Akan kings would often have female co-rulers known as Queen-mothers who typically served as figureheads but sometimes fulfilled the role of the king themselves. Especially unique, however, was the ability for both noble and non-noble individuals to become sub-chiefs, which were non-hereditary roles granted to people based on their ability to fulfill the job. \n Elements of the Akan people’s unique political organization were often transferred to nations conquered by or allied to the Akan, and even the British attempted to impose the system on some of its West African dominions due to its perceived efficiency."
 #POLITICS_AL_ZUBAYR_RAHMA_MANSUR_DESC:0 "Infamous slave trader turned pasha and Sudanese governor Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur began his trade empire in 1856, establishing a network of trading forts and engaging heavily in the sale of both ivory and slaves. With his personal army, Rahma gained control over territory spanning much of Southern Sudan (and parts of modern-day Chad and the Central African Republic) at his empire’s peak. Initially coming into conflict with Egypt, Rahma successfully fended off a mercenary invasion ordered by Isma’il Pasha, but agreed to incorporate his domain into the Egyptian Khedivate in exchange for being named Governor of the region and having his control over the territory acknowledged.\n\nRahma would later find himself at odds with the British Empire, which was expanding its control over Sudan and attempting to suppress the slave trade. He gained a reputation as a nemesis of British General Charles Gordon, both militarily supporting Gordon’s enemies and trying to negotiate with him. Rahma would surprisingly receive the title of Governor of Sudan on Gordon’s recommendation, had this title revoked due to his participation in the slave trade, and was finally allowed to return to Sudan for the final years of his life after being imprisoned by the British due to alleged disloyalty."
 POLITICS_DOST_MUHAMMAD_KHAN_DESC:0 "Dost Mohammad Khan, Afghanistan’s first Emir under the Barakzai dynasty, ruled the Emirate of Afghanistan during a characteristically tumultuous period of his country’s history.\nAs a member of the influential Barakzai clan in the Durrani Empire, Dost Mohammad and his brother Wazir Fateh Khan fought and lost to the Sikh Empire at the Battle of Attock. After their loss to the Sikhs, a former Durrani Emir had Wazir assassinated. In response, the Barakzai clan successfully rebelled against the Durranis, and having risen to become the clan’s most powerful member, Khan ascended to the Afghan throne in 1826 after the Barakzai victory.\nBeing caught between British and Russian imperial interests, Khan was forced to engage in political maneuvering to maintain Afghanistan’s independence. Initially trying and failing to cooperate with Russia, he then tried to form an alliance with Great Britain, also to no avail. Wanting to exert influence over Afghanistan, the British captured Kabul and deposed Khan in 1839, triggering the First Anglo-Afghan War. Miraculously, the Afghans won the war and restored Khan to the throne in 1842.\nDuring his second reign, Khan reaffirmed hostility towards the British and allied with his former enemy, the Sikhs. However, the defeat and annexation of the Sikh Empire into British India caused him to again reverse course, joining the British in their invasion of Persia and annexing Herat, and refraining from supporting the Indian Rebellion of 1857."
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_COGHLAN_DESC:0 "Son of renowned British naval officer Jeremiah Coghlan, Sir William Marcus Coghlan had an extensive military career of his own. He commanded several artillery detachments belonging to the Indian Army and fought in various campaigns in Afghanistan and Pakistan. \nCoghlan was appointed to be the colonial administrator of Aden in 1854, and recruited a highly capable staff to help him manage the colony. Coghlan attempted to found a school in the colony and oversaw the Protectorate’s annexation of the island of Perim in 1857."
 POLITICS_TEWODROS_II_DESC:0 "Born Kassa Hailegiorgis in 1818, Tewodros II was not of royal lineage. In fact, Kassa began his career as a “shifta,” (rebel or outlaw) rebelling against the weak authority of the then greatly divided Ethiopian state. Amidst a decades-long period of great instability, limited central authority, and civil war in Ethiopia known as the Zemene Mesafint, Kassa managed to garner a great deal of followers and control an army which repeatedly defeated the forces of the reigning regent Ali II. Kassa’s rise to power culminated after his capture of Ali II’s mother, Empress Menen Liben Amede, and the military victory over his last remaining rivals which cemented his control over all of Ethiopia; in 1855, he was crowned Emperor Tewodros II, ending an 80-year period of instability and strife.\nAs Emperor, Tewodros pursued an extensive agenda of centralization and modernization, which made him many enemies out of regional nobles who were greatly threatened by their loss of regional power and new technology. Tewodros directly appointed regional governors, reincorporated autonomously operating territories in an effort to reunify the Empire, and established a professional standing army, among other major reforms."
