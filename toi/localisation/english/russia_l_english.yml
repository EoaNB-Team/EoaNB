 RUS_idea_tsarist_vodka_monopoly_desc: "Ever since Ivan IV enforced a state monopoly over the vodka industry, Russian Tsars have greatly profited from the sale of vodka – the monetary benefits of this monopoly were so great that sometimes the lower nobles were rewarded vodka production rights instead of land or any other legal privileges. Sadly, vodka itself has had a damaging effect on the Russian society, for it is a poison to the soul and body. Whereas the western societies are energetic and ambitious, our society is subdued by this sinful drink. Alcohol is deeply rooted in Russian culture and it’ll take great effort to change this fact."

After the annexation of most minors by Russia, Abkhazia and Mingrelia seem doomed to get annexed by Russia as they can barely maintain a tiny army, have a population largely fed up with the feudal rule and are themselves obsolete. It will take a miracle to save Georgia from complete extinction..."

As a joint effort of both the Ministries of Education and Finance, the IRTS brought together capable scholars, scientists, engineers and innovators into one umbrella organization with the sole purpose of progress. It's main objective focused solely on Russia's economy, improving and innovating on methods of manufacturing and production. With many conflicted and confused about their tasks and purposes, one question remains to be answered: What should the focus of the IRTS be?"

 RUS_decision_category_milyutin_reforms_desc: "Our defeat in the Crimean war was brought to us because of our disorganized and obsolete military, which was pretty much the same as 50 years before - in the times of Napoleon! No one doubts that we defeated him, but more than 40 years of stagnation aren't healthy for anything. This mustn't last any longer, and that's why our new Minister of War, Dmitry Milytin, made an extensive report, which declared new goals for the Russian military: reorganize the army structure, make it smaller at expense of the non-combat units, make mobilization go faster and units get to their combat state quicker, make army less bulky in times of peace, create the system of military districts, arrange rearmament, make soldiers more literate and so on. Some reforms can be fired at the same time, but consequences will be more harsh then usual ones and will last longer."

 RUS_decision_mayevskys_artillery_desc: "Our cannons are still produced by the standards of the beginning of the century, while there were many innovations secured by the Western powers. One of those would be rifled guns with new construction, still loading from the front but having more accuracy and firing range, proposed by N.V. Mayevsky."
 RUS_decision_baranovskys_artillery: "Baranovsky's Artillery Model"
 RUS_decision_baranovskys_artillery_desc: "Despite having pretty good rifled cannons of Mayevsky construction, we still need the newer ones, as advancements in artillery technologies go even hastier than before. That's why V.S. Baranovsky made a new cannon... and it's surprisingly good! Every foreign spy is trying to get to know how we managed to do it, but this gun caused a new wave of innovations just by appearing!"
 RUS_decision_new_military_districts: "New Military Districts"
 RUS_decision_new_military_districts_desc: "Our army is too vast and hierarchial to manage it in the times of peace, so Milyutin proposed a new system of organization - military districts will take place of the armies, while armies and army corps are no longer present without war. This will help us to get rid of excessive administrative expenses on the upkeep of those thousands of officers."
 RUS_decision_medical_corps: "Medical Corps"
 RUS_decision_medical_corps_desc: "Medical Corps is a new institution in Russian Imperial Army, which aims to make soldiers more healthy and lower the rate of non-combat losses. It isn't too efficient, because our doctors still aren't that educated as they should be, but at least we are trying to ease the life of our soldiers in their camps and make more wounded come back to arms and less cripples come to their homes."

We should adopt this new type of armament and make use of it!"

 RUS_decision_austro_italo_french_war_desc: "Despite our neutral cause in the recently broken Austro-Italo-French war, we want France to consider us friendly, that's why we stationed some of our troops on the border of the traitorous Austria, to help the French in their war. Also we sent military observers, in other words - legal spies - to the warring states, overlooking Austrian, Sardinian and French armies, extorting new experience from that and finding out, how real army is organized, to prepare our army for the reforms."

 ### Russian Leaders
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_II_DESC: "Born in the great city of Moscow, 1818, Alexander II  (born Alexander Nikolayevich) was the eldest son and heir of Tzar Nicholas I and his spouse, Princess Charlotte of Prussia. His parent's marriage, despite being formed purely for political purposes amongst the Russian and Prussian royalty, was a prosperous one. From birth, Alexander was given the title of Tsesarevich, which has been traditionally given to the heirs of the Russian throne.\n\n The upbringing and early education of Alexander seemed inconducive to creating a great reformer. Indeed, the opposite, as currently seen throughout Russia, was true. At the time of his upbringing, the court and political atmosphere was intensely conservative under his father's authoritarian rule. Dissent from any corner, regardless of rank, was severely punishable. Even Alexander, who was dearest to his family and all of Russia, was cautious around his belligerent father.\n\n Alexander's father was nothing if not practical in the upbringing of his successor. Nicholas had an uneventful upbringing as merely a second to the throne. He was determined to not let Alexander suffer the same fate and provided him with tutors, such as the great reformer Mikhail Speransky and romantic poet Vasily Zhukovsky, as well as military advisor General Karl Merder. This combination led to Alexander being well-prepared and more liberal than his father. \n\n While traversing Western Europe in 1839, Alexander was in search of a royal wife. After a stop in Baden where his parents were advocates for the marriage of the princess, but the Tsesarevich showed no interest, an unexpected stop in Hesse proved well as he would find love in Duke Ludwig IIs Daughter, Marie. Despite some early objections from his mother and a long engagement because of Marie's youth, Alexander and Marie married on April 28, 1841. Their first child, the Grand Duchess Alexandra, was born in August 1842 but died of meningitis at a young age. In September 1843, Nicholas was born and was deemed heir, then followed in 1845 by Alexander, Vladimir in 1847, and Alexei in 1850. \n\n Alexander has shed some light on the crippled and corrupted state of Russia after the fallout of the Crimean War some years ago. Still ongoing, the Tsar has been pushing for liberation of Serfdom across the state, with many more reforms expected."
