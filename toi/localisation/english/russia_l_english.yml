It's main objective focused solely on Russia's economy, improving and innovating on methods of manufacturing and production.

No one doubts that we defeated him, but more than 40 years of stagnation aren't healthy for anything. This mustn't last any longer, and that's why our new Minister of War, Dmitry Milytin, made an extensive report, which declared new goals for the Russian military: reorganize the army structure, make it smaller at expense of the non-combat units, make mobilization go faster and units get to their combat state quicker, make army less bulky in times of peace, create the system of military districts, arrange rearmament, make soldiers more literate and so on. Some reforms can be fired at the same time, but consequences will be more harsh then usual ones and will last longer."

### Russian Leaders
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_II_DESC:0 "Born in the great city of Moscow, 1818, Alexander II  (born Alexander Nikolayevich) was the eldest son and heir of Tzar Nicholas I and his spouse, Princess Charlotte of Prussia. His parent’s marriage, despite being formed purely for political purposes amongst the Russian and Prussian royalty, was a prosperous one. From birth, Alexander was given the title of Tsesarevich, which has been traditionally given to the heirs of the Russian throne.\n\n The upbringing and early education of Alexander seemed inconducive to creating a great reformer. Indeed, the opposite, as currently seen throughout Russia, was true. At the time of his upbringing, the court and political atmosphere was intensely conservative under his father’s authoritarian rule. Dissent from any corner, regardless of rank, was severely punishable. Even Alexander, who was dearest to his family and all of Russia, was cautious around his belligerent father.\n\n Alexander’s father was nothing if not practical in the upbringing of his successor. Nicholas had an uneventful upbringing as merely a second to the throne. He was determined to not let Alexander suffer the same fate and provided him with tutors, such as the great reformer Mikhail Speransky and romantic poet Vasily Zhukovsky, as well as military advisor General Karl Merder. This combination led to Alexander being well-prepared and more liberal than his father. \n\n While traversing Western Europe in 1839, Alexander was in search of a royal wife. After a stop in Baden where his parents were advocates for the marriage of the princess, but the Tsesarevich showed no interest, an unexpected stop in Hesse proved well as he would find love in Duke Ludwig IIs Daughter, Marie. Despite some early objections from his mother and a long engagement because of Marie’s youth, Alexander and Marie married on April 28, 1841. Their first child, the Grand Duchess Alexandra, was born in August 1842 but died of meningitis at a young age. In September 1843, Nicholas was born and was deemed heir, then followed in 1845 by Alexander, Vladimir in 1847, and Alexei in 1850. \n\n Alexander has shed some light on the crippled and corrupted state of Russia after the fallout of the Crimean War some years ago. Still ongoing, the Tsar has been pushing for liberation of Serfdom across the state, with many more reforms expected."
