victoria.12.d:0 "In 1860 much of the interior of Australia remained uncharted. Some Victorians, made wealthy from the gold rushes, were prepared to fund exploratory expeditions. They had three goals: scientific discovery, seeking new grazing land and finding a route for an overland telegraph line. South Australian explorer John McDouall Stuart had already discovered productive grazing country during several expeditions from Adelaide to north of Lake Eyre by the late 1850s. The Victorian Government and the Royal SOciety of Victoria, spurred by a desire to maintain Victoria's position as the 'most advanced' colony, funded the Victorian Exploring Expedition and set it the task of being the first to traverse Australia from south to north. The expedition, one of the most expensive in Australian history, was led by Robert O'Hara Burke, an Irishman with no exploration experience or skills in surverying or navigation. It was lavishly equipped with items including 50 gallons of rum to revive tired camels (there were 27 of them), and an oak table.

Coranderrk's residents fought against efforts to control their lives. Their sustained resistance is often cited as among the first Indigenous campaigns for land rights and self-determination. In June 1863, 2300 acres were gazeted as a reserve for Coranderrk Aboriginal Station. Indigenous testimony shows that Coranderrk was product and profitable.

Given the tension between Catholics and Protestants in Australia this was a provocative gesture.

The legislation made Victoria the first Australian colony (and one of the first jurisdictions in the world) to offer free, secular and compulsory education to its children. Children between the ages of six and fifteen were obliged to attend school and their education was free. In addition, all government funding to church schools ceased. Most of the religious denominations, with the exception of the Roman Catholics, allowed their schools to form part of this new system. The Education Act, although contentious and accused of being politically motivated, was the first of its kind in the Australian colonies, and Victoria became one of the first regions in the world to offer free, secular and compulsory education."

The main hall of the Exhibition presented a very difference appearance to that which it were on the previous evening. The last exhibits to arrive had reached their appointed places, there was no trace of the confusion which a few hours before reigned supreme, and when the aisles were filled with the dense trhong of visitors, the eye could not rest upon a fairer picture, for apart from the ornamental efects of some of the mere artistically disposed wares, the original decorations of the walls were aided by a profusion of flags, which ran in a parti-coloured line from end to end of the building, and the softened light which streamed through the stained windows heightened the effect of the various animate and inanimate groupings. Visitors began to arrive long before inaugural ceremony was begun, and these wisely availed themselves of the opportunity to inspect the exhibits before the different comparments became too croweded for that operation to be accomplished with any degree of comfort."

victoria.36.t:0 "Depression"
victoria.36.d:0 "During the 1880s, there had been a speculative boom in the Australian property market. The optimistic climate was fostered by the commercial banks, and also led to the proliferation of non-bank institutions such as building societies; as they were operating in a free banking system, there were few legal restrictions on their operations, and there was no central bank of government-provided deposit guarantees. Consequently, these banks and related bodies lent extravagantly, for property development, but following the collapse of the land boom after 1888, a large number of enterprises that had borrowed money found themselves unable to repay these debts, and many began to declare bankruptcy. Banks and non-bank institutions came under increasing financial pressure, and the full extent of the crisis became apparent when the Federal Bank of Australia failed on the 30th of Janurary 1893. The situation was particularly acute in Victoria, and on the 1st of May 1893, the Victorian government implemented a five-day bank holiday to ameliorate the financial panic and pevent any further run on the banks. By 17th May, 11 commercial bank in Sydney, Melbourne, as well as other locations in Australia, had temporarily or permanently closed their doors. -- A period of prosperity in the 1880s led to a wild speculation in land and buildings, and money poured in from England. Land companies, mortgage societies, municipal bodies, building societies, and a host of other organisations all clamoured for a share in the good things that were on offer, and probably 40,000,00 pounds flowed into Victoria during a period of six years. With so much money in circulation, a ficticious prosperity of a feverish sort resulted. The banks issued notes to the value of millions of pounds, and trade and industry flourish as never before. The reaction came quickly. Public confidence subsided just as quickly. A run commenced on the bank, and the bursting of the boom brought with it widespread disaster. 14 banks failed, twelve of those with 905 branches throughout Australia, had liabilities assessed at 166,000,000 pounds, and thousands of people lost the whole of their possessions. Bank notes in many cases became worthless, and Victoria reached the farthest depth of a financial depression. Unemployment became widespread, wages and prices dropped and bankruptcies followed one another."
