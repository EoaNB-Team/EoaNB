 AUS_focus_rely_on_senior_officers_desc: "Our senior officers represent the accumulation of all Austrian military knowledge, and we should rely on them rather than younger potentially radical officers.

 austria.401.a: "We need to redeem our reputation at all cost."
 austria.402.t: "The Fall of Alexander von Bach"
 austria.402.d: "Baron Alexander von Bach was the Austrian Minister of the Interior since 1849, known in the Austrian Empire as the man behind the centralization of the administrative authority of the Empire during the early years of Franz Joseph's reign. He then shifted more and more towards reactionary and absolutist ideas, which drastically and profoundly shaped the Austrian Empire during the 1850s, an era often called 'Bach's absolutism', or, due to his cooperation with the Catholic Church, 'Klerikalabsolutismus'.\n\nHowever, blamed for the failure of the Autrian-Sardinian War, von Bach has recently fallen from grace. His reforms were seen as one of the main reasons for the defeat, as they weakened the industrial potential of Austria and alienated many potential allies in the German Confederation. After his resignation a new man to lead the way needs to be appointed, and some degree of reform is inevitable. Count Bernhard von Rechberg seems like an obvious choice. As Austrian representative to the Federal Convention at Frankfurt and president of that institution, he looks like the ideal candidate to redeem our reputation among the German states and to assert our influence across Europe. Count Agenor Gołuchowski would be a more reformist choice. Himself a native of Galicia and the crownland's governor, he would certainly somewhat calm the nationalist agitation that is rampant across the realm, as it would signal that we are not reliant on German aristocrats for the government."

From bureaucratic issues and obvious problems in the army, to ethnic minorities demanding an ever-increasing level of autonomy, the realm was in dire need of reform.\n\nAfter consulting the Reichsrat, the Imperial Parliament, for guidance on potential reforms for the Empire, the mainly conservative body naturally suggested a return of aristocratic federalism, and the Emperor followed suit. He asked his Minister of Interior to write a new constitutional diploma to be enacted across the Empire.\n\nDespite this generous new constitution, our financial situation continues to tumble and nationalist agitation, particularly in Hungary, is worsening. The failures of our administration are becoming clearer and clearer, a weakness that has even started to attract the attention of the German Confederation, and Prussia in particular. The influential German-speaking liberals across the Empire are pushing for a revision of the constitution - and a return to a more centralized state. The constitutional diploma seems to be a failure.

The Secret Police has tracked down several 'Pro-Independence Committees' operating throughout Hungary and many more are believed to exist. These committees have been collecting funds from abroad to fund a planned revolt. In addition to that, the people too appear dissatisfied with our administration and a large part of the Magyars have refused to pay taxes. The general consensus is that an uprising appears to be planned in Hungary."
 austria.1501.a: "Worrying..."
 austria.1502.t: "The Second Hungarian Revolution"
 austria.1502.d: "Disaster has struck the monarchy. The Minister of Interior was indeed correct to assume the existence of a large network conspiring to establish an independent Hungary. Several thousand of men throughout the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen have taken up arms and have declared the 'Hungarian Republic' under the leadership of Lajos Kossuth who is currently on exile in Turin, in the [PIE.GetName]. The Hungarian revolt has been dubbed 'the Second Hungarian Revolution' and should we not crush the revolt as quickly as possible, it is very much possible that the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen will be lost from the Habsburg domains, and that the Magyars will inspire other nationalities within our empire such as Slavs or Romanians to revolt as well."
 austria.1502.a: "Crush the Revolt"
 austria.1502.b: "The Magyar Nation will rise again"
 austria.1503.t: "The Hungarian Nation"
 austria.1503.d: "The Hungarian Nation has once again proclaimed its independence. It was not a long time ago when in 1848 Hungary proclaimed its independence, under the leadership of Lajos Batthyány. The revolution, initially successful, failed miserably following Russian intervention, leading to over a decade and more of civil repression from Vienna. The Magyars have risen once again and are ready to write their own destiny: the ancestral Hungarian nation will be restored."
 austria.1503.a: "To Victory"
 austria.1504.t: "The War Begins"
 austria.1504.d: "After long and tense years of rivalry between the Kingdoms of Austria and of Hungary, war as finally broken out as Hungary declares its independence. While expected, it still comes as a shock for the Austrian nation, as the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy had become the new normal for centuries.\n\nAs both armies moves forward, Hungary will now fight for survival, and Austria, for its Kingdom."
 austria.1504.a: "Für den Kaiser"
 austria.1505.t: "The Austrians plea for peace"
 austria.1505.d: "After a long and tiresome war, the Austrian finally want to negotiate peace with the victorious Hungarian nation. While the war wasn't easily won, it still ended up a great source of pride for the Hungarian army.\n\nWhile the Austrian prepares the white flag, the Hungarian are preparing their treaties. Some among them, still wants the holding of the Croatian territory though, some even among the high command."

 austria.1505.b: "No Croatia, no deal."
 austria.1506.t: "The Treaty of Pressburg"

Austria has signed the Treaty of Pressburg, granting Hungary formal independence from Austria, and even the Croatian territory on top of that.\n\nSince the first Hungarian Revolution in 1848/49, the people of Hungary had been longing for the day they could claim themselves truly sovereign. And now, after many years of hardship and struggle, they can happily wave the Hungarian national flag in Buda."
 austria.1506.a: "The Magyar Nation is reborn!"
 #ITALIAN ORGANIZATION AFTER VICTORY IN 2IW
 austria.1601.t: "The Future of Lombardy-Venetia"
 austria.1601.d: "The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia has been ours since the Congress of Vienna in 1815, following Napoleon's defeat. The Kingdom has however been a site of often violent insurrections by Italian nationalists again the Habsburg rule and with our close victory against Piedmont the time has come to decide on how we should deal with the Kingdom. A prominent idea put forward by the Conservatives is to annex Venice into the Austrian Empire, effectively recreating the Duchy of Lombardy. A popular option amongst the more Moderates is to keep the same structure for the Kingdom while the Liberals propose to give it more autonomy, in order to satisfy the Italians."
 austria.1601.a: "Annex Venetia"
 austria.1601.b: "Enforce the Status Quo"
 austria.1601.c: "Loosen the grip on the Kingdom"
 austria.1602.t: "The Future of the Central Italian States"
 austria.1602.d: "[LVN.GetName], Modena, Parma and Tuscany have belonged to our sphere of influence since the Congress of Vienna. The Duchy of Modena and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany have been ruled by Habsburg offsprings while the Duchy of Parma has been ruled by a Bourbon, which has effectively made these three states our client states due to our ideological and military support for them. With the war now over, we can finally see what we should do with the three states. Conservatives propose we keep the status quo, which would make them susceptible to nationalist infiltrations. Liberals, on the other hand, propose that we create a confederation - the Italian League - to convince the Italians that the Habsburgs only have good intentions for Italy."
 austria.1602.a: "Create the Italian League"
 AUS_italian_league_effect_tt: "The §YItalian League§! is formed composed of §Y[LVN.GetName]§!, §YModena§!, §YParma§! and §YTuscany§!."
 austria.1602.b: "Enforce the Status Quo"
 austria.1603.t: "Cede Savoy and Nice to France?"
 austria.1603.d: "The territories of Savoy and Nice located on the border between Italy and France have always been a contentious issue. For centuries both Italian, they were annexed by the French Republic in 1792 due to their high French-speaking population, before being returned to Sardinia-Piedmont in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Now that northern Italy is firmly under our rule, we can opt to cede them to France. Doing so will increase our relations with them, which might entice France to help us in possible future struggles, but it will alienate Britain, and will anger Italian nationalists even further."
 austria.1603.a: "We need all the friends we can get."
 austria.1603.b: "It is too risky."
 austria.1604.t: "Austria Cedes Savoy and Nice"
 austria.1604.d: "On [GetDateText] our troops entered Savoy and Nice for the first time since 1815, when it was ceded to the Piedmontese. The population cheered the French troops and thousands attended the official ceremony of the handing of Chambery from Austria to France. The agreement known as the 'Franco-Austrian Agreement on Savoy of [GetYear]' was signed between Staatsminister [AUS.GetLeader] of Austria and [FRA.GetLeader] of France. With this glorious agreement, the Austrians have not only proven that they can be trusted, but in fact that they can be good friends of ours. The Emperor later declared that 'the old grudge between France and Austria has been ended, now we can only expect friendship', effectively instructing his government to consider Austria a friend, not an enemy."
 austria.1604.a: "Wonderful news."
 #FEDERALIZATION OF THE EMPIRE
 austria.1701.t: "Negotiations Begin with the Nationalities of the Empire"
 austria.1701.d: "The Austrian Empire is now heading towards forming a great Central European federation of semi-autonomous states. Historically, the Empire had always been separated into two main areas, administered by Austria (Cisleithania) and by Hungary (Transleithania).\n\nWith our new federation being drafted, we might want to give the smaller nationalities some autonomy as well. It could weaken our two nations, but in the process we will be able to create a more stable federation."
 austria.1701.a: "Negotiate only with the Magyars"
 austria.1701.b: "Negotiate with all the Nationalities"
 austria.1702.t: "The Vienna Conference"
 austria.1702.d: "Kaiser Franz Joseph has called representatives from all of the Empire to discuss the framework of the Austrian Federation in Vienna. The Vienna Conference, as it is called, will decide on the fate of the multiple minorities in the Empire. The Federation will finally resolve the issues of autonomy, and national struggles.\n\nThe Kaier has high hopes for the conference's ability to resolve the problems of the crumbling Empire. Only God knows what the future of the Empire holds, but the Kaiser will listen to each group, listening to their demands and deciding on what's the most fair for the greater good of the Empire. Hopefully, that will be enough to restore peace."
 austria.1702.a: "Let's hope all goes well"
 austria.1703.t: "The Vienna Conference Ends"
 austria.1703.d: "After many months of negotiations, the Vienna Conference finally ended. The Kaiser ha listened, and has taken his decision on every matter of interest.\n\nThe new federation will not be enacted, and the territorial changes will be made official. Autonomy for some, status-quo for others. Not everyone can be pleased in politics, but the Kaiser is confident that these new borders and administrations will at least buy him a few decades of peace.\n\nFor the better, or for the worst, Long Live the Federation and the Kaiser!"
 austria.1703.a: "The Empire is reborn"
 austria.1704.t: "Negotiate with the Magyars"
 austria.1704.d: "The biggest minority in the Austrian Empire, the Magyar has always been keen on gaining autonomy in the Kingdom. The 1848 has shown that the idea won't be abandoned until they have what they want, which is the reason for this negotiations.\n\nWe now have to decided whether or not the Austrian Crown accepts or rejects the Hungarian one. However, it seems obvious that refuing it will only lead to trouble."
 austria.1704.a: "Accept the Hungarian Crown"
 austria.1704.b: "Reject the Hungarian Crown"
 austria.1705.t: "Negotiate with the Slovaks"
 austria.1705.d: "The Slovaks are one of the many minorities in the Carpathians. Located in Northern Transleithania, right in the historically Hungarian lands, the Slovaks has asked for autonomy like many others in the Empire. Now, with the Federation being drafted, we can officially state our position on a Slovakian autonomous region.\n\nWe could accept total autonomy of the Slovaks, but giving it to Hungary might also strengthen it."
 austria.1705.a: "Enact Slovak Autonomy"
 austria.1705.b: "Keep Slovakia under Hungary"
 austria.1706.t: "Negotiate with the Transylvanians"
 austria.1706.d: "Transylvania is a province right in the middle of Hungarian Transleithania. While Transylvanians had relative autonomy, under a principality separate from the Hungarian crown, it still was formally administrated by the Hungarians.\n\nTransylvania could be a great candidate for full autonomy, which could stabilize the area, but also weaken Hungary. We could also keep the most Hungarian area of Szekerland in Hungaria, while giving the rest full autonomy."
 austria.1706.a: "Give Full Autonomy to Transylvania"
 austria.1706.b: "Give Autonomy to Transylvania Save for Szekerland"
 austria.1706.c: "Keep Transylvania under Hungary"
 austria.1707.t: "Negotiate with the Croatians"
 austria.1707.d: "Crotia had always been a source of tensions in the Austrian Empire. While Hungary claims most of it, the Croats, like many others, wanted more autonomy, and the ability to decide their fate themselves. Dalmatia has some of the most important ports of the Austrian Empire, so while Croatian autonomy will stabilize the Empire, it might also make Austrian presence in the Mediterranean weaker.\n\nWe could give Croatia only the non-Dalmatian part of the territory they claims, but we also could let it stay inside of Hungary."
 austria.1707.a: "Full Autonomy with Dalmatia"
 austria.1707.b: "Autonomy without Dalmatia"
 austria.1707.c: "Full Autonomy with Dalmatia"
 austria.1708.t: "Negotiate with the Italians"

 austria.1708.b: "Give Venice Autonomy"
 austria.1708.c: "Give Autonomy"
 austria.1708.e: "Give Venice Autonomy"
 austria.1709.t: "Negotiate with the Bohemians"
 austria.1709.d: "Bohemia is part of the Austrian administred area, Cisleithania. The Bohemians militated for the return of the Kingdom of Bohemia. The Czech politicians, often liberal, are now open to negotiate their autonomy with Austria.\n\nThe historical territory of the Kingdom of Bohemia claimed by the Czech contains a German-majority area, Sudentenland. We could allow Bohemian autonomy under the condition that Austria would keep it, but Austria could also keep the whole territory, as they could use the economic support coming from the wealthy lands of Bohemia."
 austria.1709.a: "Full Autonomy for Bohemia"
 austria.1709.b: "Sudentenland under Austria, the rest for Bohemia"
 austria.1709.c: "All of Bohemia will stay under Austria"
 austria.1710.t: "Negotiate with the Galicians"
 austria.1710.d: "The vast territory of Galicia-Lodomeria lies at the easternmost part of the Austrian-administred Cisleithania territory. Galician culture has always been at odds with the Vienna leadership. Closer to Poland than it is to Austria, they have called for autonomy for centuries. Now that the federation is being formed, they want to take their chance."
 austria.1710.a: "Give Full Autonomy to Galicia"
 austria.1710.b: "Give Cracow Autonomy but not Galicia"
 austria.1710.c: "All of Galicia will stay under Austria"
 austria.1711.t: "Negotiate with the Serbians"
 austria.1711.d: "The small province of Vojvodina is a Slavic majority region in Southern Transleithania, under official Hungary control. While they are a very small region, which wouldn't cause much trouble, we might look into making them truely autonomous. The new federation needs to take into account the needs of all of the minorities in the Empire."

It is now time to find a compromise."
 austria.2001.a: "Excellent!"
 austria.2002.t: "Restoration of the Historic Hungarian Constitution"
 austria.2002.d: "Today the Emperor has decided to effectively restore the former Hungarian constitution. Another step towards compromise between the two realms, it is part of the greater negotiations with the Hungarians. While unpopular among the Austrian Germans, this action has pleased many among the Hungarian population, which puts the negotiations on the right track."
 austria.2002.a: "One step further towards reconciliation."
 AUS_restore_hungarian_constitution_effect_tt: "This will mean that the Hungarian realm will be ruled by Emperor Franz Joseph as a separate entity from the Austrian Empire."

 austria.2004.t: "Appointing A Hungarian Prime Minister"
 austria.2004.d: "Now that Hungary had its former Constitution restored, it needs a Prime Minister to lead it. We have multiple choices for this positions, but two mens seems particularly fit for the task ahead.\n\nFerenc Deák is a liberal Hungarian nationalist. Nicknamed the "sage of the nation", he led the moderate Hungarians during the 1848 Revolution, and since then had gained even more fame after he proposed to Franz Joseph a compromise between the two nations. He had an essential role in the current compromise, but he doesn't seem keen on getting the role of Prime Minister.\n\nHowever, Count Gyula Andrássy would also be a prefect fit. A passionate revolutionary during the 1848 Revolution, he's a fervant Hungarian nationalist, and one of the most vocal voices for its autonomy in the Austrian Empire. This "greater than life" personally has gained an almost mythical reputation, even during his exile following the revolution. While anti-Habsburg, he would still be perfect to lead the nascent Hungarian autonomous realm."
 austria.2004.a: "Ferenc Deák"
 austria.2004.b: "Gyula Andrássy"
 austria.2005.t: "Franz Joseph Crowned King of Hungary"
 austria.2005.d: "Today, Kaiser Franz Joseph the First, emperor of the Austrian Empire, was crowned King of Hungary. The ceremony, the final step in this great compromise between the two kingdoms, will formalize the union of both crown.\n\nThe Austrian Empire has now been reformed into a dual-monarchy, and now that it has found peace, it can look outwards into Europe. The Austrian Empire has finally resolved one of their greatest issue."

The Congress of Vienna constituted a Polish rump state in a personal union with Russia, the rest of it was divided between us and the Prussians. Our Galician holdings are home to a number of Poles who, although loyal so far, might remember the days of Polish greatness, so we must be aware of their activities."

 AUS_idea_hungarian_revolution: "The Hungarian Revolution of 1848/49"
 AUS_idea_hungarian_revolution_desc: "After a series of defeats in the Revolution of 1848, the Austrian state came close to the brink of collapse. Hungarian nationalists, lead by their inspiring leader Lajos Kossuth, rose up in arms to regain independence for Hungary. Pressured and on the defensive on many front, the young emperor Franz Joseph, who followed his uncle Ferdinand I on the throne following the insurgency, had to call for Russian help in the name of the Holy Alliance. Tsar Nicholas I answered, and sent a 200,000 men strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian insurgents in August 1849. After the restoration of the Habsburg Monarchy to full authority, Hungary was placed under brutal martial law. Because of this a lot of Hungarians hold a strong resentment against Austria and the Austrians and are actively working to sabotage Austrian control over Hungary."

 AUS_idea_grundentlastungspatent_desc: "Serfdom had a long history in the various parts of the [AUS.GetName]. It was officially abandoned during the Revolution of 1848 across the Empire, but the question of compensation for the landowners remained. Under the stipulations of the so-called 'Grundentlastungspatent', the peasant is required to pay one third of the market value of their piece of land to their former master, while the state is covering another third. Many peasants and their families cannot afford to pay this price and are forced to migrate to the cities to look for wage labor, and even if they can pay, the last third is lost for the landowner, which makes this regulation unpopular among the wealthy."

 # Austrian Leader Descriptions #
 ################################
 
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_BACH_DESC: "Baron Alexander von Bach serves as the Interior Minister of the Habsburg Monarchy and is the de-facto leader of Austria in the matters of internal politics. The Baron comes from a family with a long history in the matter of law, and he himself is a Doctor of Laws and a loyal servant of the Empire. Ever since he took power, in 1849 during the Revolution, he has sought to depart from Metternich's over-controlling system but at the same time has kept much of Metternich's principles in practice in his Klerikalabsolutist form of governance. The Baron favors centralizing the Empire, with Vienna as the center of everything, and to maintain loyalty to the Emperor through a rigorous use of the secret police. The Baron is also, like most Conservative members of the Government, a supporter of the Catholic Church within Austria. Even though he enjoys he the support of the Emperor and of most German-Austrians, the Baron's policies have deeply dissatisfied the other ethnic groups in the Empire, and perhaps in due time it will be revealed his policies might have done more harm than good when it comes to the loyalty of Franz Joseph's subjects..."
 POLITICS_BERNHARD_VON_RECHBERG_DESC: "Born in Regensburg in 1806, Count Johann Bernhard von Rechberg und Röthenlöwen was initially supposed to pursue the same path as his father, Count Aloys, becoming a Bavarian statesman, but fate would not see it that way. After his education at the universities of Strasbourg and Munich, he incurred the displeasure of the Bavarian King Ludwig I due to Rechberg's role in a duel. Subsequently, he transferred himself to the Austrian diplomatic service in 1828. In the following years, he was a part of the Austrian diplomatic corps in the Berlin, London, and Brussels, before being appointed envoy at Stockholm in 1841 and, two years later, in Brazil.\n\nDuring the March Revolutions of 1848/49, he was appointed Austrian plenipotentiary to the Frankfurt Parliament, convening to prepare the unification of Germany, which did not go through in the end. In 1853, he entered public service in Lombardy-Venetia, assisting Radetzky and the other rulers in the civilian administration of the Habsburg-led kingdom, before returning to Frankfurt, where he spent two years as the Austrian representative and the appointed president of the German 'Bundestag'. Now, in these trying times, the Emperor thinks that von Rechberg is the best option for solving our problems after the defeat in Italy. With his experience he would also be able to steer our policy in the German Confederation, where the dissent between Austria and Prussia has been growing over the last years. Rechberg shares the values of our former State Chancellor Klemens von Metternich and is often regarded as a pupil of the latter. This has brought von Rechberg into a favorable position in 1848, when he accompanied von Metternich on a flight to England, and right after that was appointed Austrian representative to Frankfurt during the revolution.\n\nHe thinks that Austria and Prussia need to compromise and to have good relations in order to maintain conservative dominance over Germany. As Staatsminister and Foreign Secretary he will have the opportunity to implement his policies in the Empire. He has the trust of the Emperor to solve the heated situation across the realm in favor of the government and to fix the issues his predecessor has caused, especially in regards to the current situation in Germany."
 POLITICS_AGENOR_GOLUCHOWSKI_DESC: "Count Agenor Romuald Gołuchowski was appointed to replace Baron Alexander von Bach as Interior Minister. He is a Conservative and an aristocrat from Galicia and a close advisor to the Emperor, furthermore he has had a successful tenure as Governor of Galicia where he did several projects benefitting the poor region. The Count will oversee the creation of a Constitution liberal enough to satisfy the populace. Nonetheless, he might not be charismatic enough to reconcile all the different ethnic groups within the Empire..."
 POLITICS_ANTON_VON_SCHMERLING_DESC: "Anton Ritter von Schmerling is the first Liberal Interior Minister of the Austrian Empire since the Congress of Vienna. Born in Vienna he studied law and for over twenty years served as a public servant in Lower Austria. He rose to prominence during the Revolutions of 1848 when he became President of the Confederate Diet. He supported the Government of Archduke John and quelled the revolt that broke out in Frankfurt.He returned to Vienna with the collapse of the Revolutions and became Minister of Justice until his resignation in 1851. Anton von Schmerling is a Liberal and a Centralist - he believes Austria should become a fully unitary state with a parliamentary government. While his ideas are seen with suspicion from the nobility and the Conservatives, he is seen as a man who might be able to unite the different ethnic groups under German power. The Emperor has put a lot of trust in him, and it remains to be seen what von Schmerling can accomplish." 
 POLITICS_ARCHDUKE_RAINER_DESC: "Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria is one of the several senior members of the Habsburg Monarchy. The Archduke studied law in Vienna and as most male members of the Monarchy he joined the Imperial Army. He married his cousin Archduchess Marie Karoline of Austria in 1852, which was to prove a very happy marriage. The Archduke was only mildly interested in politics, but he was seen as a perfect person to continue absolutism in the Empire by the court and so was appointed as Interior Minister by Franz Joseph. The Archduke is perhaps what the Empire needs, a pragmatic leader, though like the Emperor, perhaps slightly inert. Most of the actual power falls within the Absolutist faction within the court, and it is their job to ensure all men and women in the Empire are loyal subjects to His Majesty."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_VON_BELCREDI_DESC: "Count Richard von Belcredi was appointed to replace Anton von Schmerling as the Interior Minister. The Count stems from Margraviate of Moravia, though his family descends from Lombardy, and studied law in Prague and then Vienna. Already a member of the Landtag since 1861, he is a seasoned bureaucrat and an opponent to the so called 'Compromise' with the Hungarians. The Count instead supports that the Empire becomes federalized, though in a conservative way where the local nobles retain essentially all power, in order to combat the various separatist movements. It is ultimately up to the Emperor whether Count von Belcredi will stay for long as Interior Minister, or he will be replaced with a more accommodating politician, as Anton von Schmerling was."
 POLITICS_FRIEDRICH_FERDINAND_VON_BEUST_DESC: "Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust is an odd choice for Staatsminister, he is both a Saxon and a Protestant. Despite this, he is a clear opponent of Prussia, which so gravely offended us, as well as a very competent statesman. It is hope the Count will bring to an end the negotiations with the Magyars and restore faith to the Monarchy. It is time that misfortune ends and a new period of peace and stability is ushered..."
