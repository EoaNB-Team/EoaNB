In light of this we must reorganize our cavalry to both cut down costs and improve their effectiveness in battle."

Instead, we will keep both as our current institutions to meet our own needs."
 AUS_focus_rely_on_senior_officers:0 "Rely on Senior Officers"
 AUS_focus_rely_on_senior_officers_desc:0 "Our senior officers represent the accumulation of all Austrian military knowledge, and we should rely on them rather than younger potentially radical officers. The fact that they are mostly conservative and aristocratic is simply a wonderful coincidence. If we can encourage them to stay in active service for longer, we will also save money on pensions and pay for new officers."

 AUS_focus_follow_hauslabs_ideas:0 "Follow Hauslab's Ideas"
 AUS_focus_follow_hauslabs_ideas_desc:0 "The so-called 'Stoßtaktik' is madness! Our men will throw their lives away without proper support.

While the rest of Europe upheaved their naval production during the Age of Exploration and furthered it during the Napoleonic Age, Austria sat back and promoted a "Fleet in Being" doctrine, partially due to its advantageous seafaring and rivaling neighbors to the south.

 #DOMESTIC POLICY EVENTS
 austria.401.t:0 "The Fall of Alexander von Bach"
 austria.401.d:0 "Baron Alexander von Bach was the Austrian Minister of the Interior since 1849, known in the Austrian Empire as the man behind the centralization of the administrative authority of the Empire during the early years of Franz Joseph's reign. He then shifted more and more towards reactionary and absolutist ideas, which drastically and profoundly shaped the Autrian Empire during the 1850s, an era often called 'Bach's absolutism', or, due to his cooperation with the Catholic Church, 'Klerikalabsolutismus'.\n\nHowever, blamed for the failure of the Autrian-Sardinian War, von Bach has recently fallen from grace. His reforms were seen as one of the main reasons for the defeat, as they weakened the industrial potential of Austria and alienated many potential allies in the German Confederation. After his resignation a new man to lead the way needs to be appointed, and some degree of reform is inevitable. Count Bernhard von Rechberg seems like an obvious choice. As Austrian representative to the Federal Convention at Frankfurt and president of that institution, he looks like the ideal candidate to redeem our reputation among the German states and to assert our influence across Europe. Count Agenor Gołuchowski would be a more reformist choice. Himself a native of Galicia and the crownland's governor, he would certainly somewhat calm the nationalist agitation that is rampant across the realm, as it would signal that we are not reliant on German aristocrats for the government."

From bureaucratic issues, to Hungarians and Czechs demanding an ever increasing amount of autonomy, a new Austria need to be built.\n\nAfter asking the Reichsrat, the Imperial Parliament, for guidance on potential reforms of the empire, the mainly conservative body naturally suggested a return of aristocratic federalism. The Emperor adopted this idea, and asked his Minister of Interior to write this new constitution of the Empire, the "October Diploma"\n\nHowever, even after it has passed, the economy continued to fail. The failures of the administration just became even more clear, weaknesses that has started to attract the attention of the German Confederation, and Prussia in particular. Liberals in the Empire are pushing for a rewrite of the new constitution, and a return to a more centralized state. The October Diploma was a complete failure."

In 1867, Hungary gained direct rule, and step by step the Voivodeship has been incorporated into the Kingdom.\n\nAfter two decades of existance, the Serbian Voivodeship has been officially abolished, and the Serbian autonomy has been curbed once again."

 AUS_idea_hungarian_revolution_desc:0 "After a series of defeats in the Revolution of 1848, the Austrian state came close to the brink of collapse. Hungarian nationalists, lead by their inspiring leader Lajos Kossuth, rose up in arms to regain independence for Hungary. Pressured and on the defensive on many front, the young emperor Franz Joseph, who followed his uncle Ferdinand I on the throne following the insurgency, had to call for Russian help in the name of the Holy Alliance. Tsar Nicholas I answered, and sent a 200,000 men strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian insurgents in August 1849. After the restoration of the Habsburg Monarchy to full authority, Hungary was placed under brutal martial law. Because of this a lot of Hungarians hold a strong resentment against Austria and the Austrians and are actively working to sabotage Austrian control over Hungary."

Under the stipulations of the so-called 'Grundentlastungspatent', the peasant is required to pay one third of the market value of their piece of land to their former master, while the state is covering another third. Many peasants and their families cannot afford to pay this price and are forced to migrate to the cities to look for wage labor, and even if they can pay, the last third is lost for the landowner, which makes this regulation unpopular among the wealthy."

 # Austrian Leader Descriptions #
 ################################
 
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_BACH_DESC:0 "Baron Alexander von Bach serves as the Interior Minister of the Habsburg Monarchy and is the de facto leader of Austria in the matters of internal politics. The Baron comes from a family with a long history in the matter of law, and he himself is a Doctor of Laws and a loyal servant of the Empire. Ever since he took power, in 1849 during the Revolution, he has sought to depart from Metternich's overcontrolling system but at the same time has kept much of Metternich's principles in practice in his Klerikalabsolutist form of governance. The Baron favours centralising the Empire, with Vienna as the center of everything, and to maintain loyalty to the Emperor through a rigorous use of the secret police. The Baron is also, like most Conservative members of the Government, a supporter of the Catholic Church within Austria. Even though he enjoys he the support of the Emperor and of most German-Austrians, the Baron's policies have deeply dissatisfied the other ethnic groups in the Empire, and perhaps in due time it will be revealed his policies might have done more harm than good when it comes to the loyalty of Franz Joseph's subjects..."
 POLITICS_ANTON_VON_SCHMERLING_DESC:0 "Anton Ritter von Schmerling is the first Liberal Interior Minister of the Austrian Empire since the Congress of Vienna. Born in Vienna he studied law and for over twenty years served as a public servant in Lower Austria. He rose to prominence during the Revolutions of 1848 when he became President of the Confederate Diet. He supported the Government of Archduke John and quelled the revolt that broke out in Frankfurt.He returned to Vienna with the collapse of the Revolutions and became Minister of Justice until his resignation in 1851. Anton von Schmerling is a Liberal and a Centralist - he belives Austria should become a fully unitary state with a parliamentary government. While his ideas are seen with suspicion from the nobility and the Conservatives, he is seen as a man who might be able to unite the different ethnic groups under German power. The Emperor has put a lot of trust in him, and it remains to be seen what von Schmerling can accomplish."
 POLITICS_AGENOR_GOLUCHOWSKI_DESC:0 "Count Agenor Romuald Gołuchowski was appointed to replace Baron Alexander von Bach as Interior Minister. He is a Conservative and an aristocrat from Galicia and a close advisor to the Emperor, furthermore he has had a successful tenure as Governor of Galicia where he did several projects benefitting the poor region. The Count will oversee the creation of a Constitution liberal enough to satisfy the populace. Nonetheless, he might not be charismatic enough to reconcile all the different ethnic groups within the Empire..."
 POLITICS_ARCHDUKE_RAINIER_DESC:0 "Archduke Rainier Ferdinand of Austria is one of the several senior members of the Habsburg Monarchy. The Archduke studied law in Vienna and as most male members of the Monarchy he joined the Imperial Army. He married his cousine Archduchess Marie Karoline of Austria in 1852, which was to prove a very happy marriage. The Archduke was only mildly interested in politics, but he was seen as a perfect person to continue absolutism in the Empire by the court and so was appointed as Interior Minister by Franz Joseph. The Archduke is perhaps what the Empire needs, a pragmatic leader, though like the Emperor, perhaps slightly inert. Most of the actual power falls within the Absolutist faction within the court, and it is their job to ensure all men and women in the Empire are loyal subjects to His Majesty."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_VON_BELCREDI_DESC:0 "Count Richard von Belcredi was appointed to replace Anton von Schmerling as the Interior Minister. The Count stems from Margraviate of Moravia, though his familly descends from Lombardy, and studied law in Prague and then Vienna. Already a member of the Landtag since 1861, he is a seasoned bureaucrat and an opponent to the so called 'Compromise' with the Hungarians. The Count instead supports that the Empire becomes federalised, though in a conservative way where the local nobles retain essentially all power, in order to combat the various separatist movements. It is ultimately up to the Emperor whether Count von Belcredi will stay for long as Interior Minister, or he will be replaced with a more accomodating politician, as Anton von Schmerling was."
 POLITICS_FRIEDRICH_FERDINAND_VON_BEUST_DESC:0 "Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust is an odd choice for Ministerpräsident, he is both a Saxon and a Protestant. Despite this, he is a clear opponent of Prussia, which so gravely offended us, as well as a very competent statesman. It is hope the Count will bring to an end the negotiations with the Magyars and restore faith to the Monarchy. It is time that misfortune ends and a new period of peace and stability is ushered..."
