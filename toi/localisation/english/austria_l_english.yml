 AUS_focus_the_austrian_army:0 "The Austrian Army"
 AUS_focus_the_austrian_army_desc:0 "Our army is the backbone of the Empire and one of the most important factors of keeping it safe from internal and external threats and as so we should incourage army training to prepare for the worst."
 AUS_focus_degenfelds_army_reform:0 "Degenfeld's Army Reform"
 AUS_focus_degenfelds_army_reform_desc:0 "We will appoint the reluctant Feldzeugmeister von Degenfeld as war minister and put him in charge of reforming the army in accordance with the wishes of the Reichsrat. By reassuring him that his planned reforms will be put in place he will serve us well."
 AUS_focus_benedeks_army_reform:0 "Benedek's Army Reform"
 AUS_focus_benedeks_army_reform_desc:0 "We will appoint Radetzky’s former chief of staff and popular war hero, Feldzeugmeister von Benedek. Von Benedek believes the army is the only guard against revolutions like in 1848 and hopes to preserve the 'old army spirit' in our military, along with many of its old institutions from what he believes are overly intellectual ideas for reform."
 AUS_focus_army_telegraphy:0 "Army Telegraphy"
 AUS_focus_army_telegraphy_desc:0 "We must make use of modern advancements in communications and expand our current telegraph system beyond Vienna to allow its use in times of war and peace. By ensuring communication between our far flung provinces we can ensure their loyalty and security as well as providing reinforcements where they are needed."
 AUS_focus_expansion_of_technical_troops:0 "Expansion of Technical Troops"
 AUS_focus_expansion_of_technical_troops_desc:0 "We employ very few technical troops per soldier, which makes maintaining our logistics and proper support of our fighting capabilities very difficult. We will include our technical troops as integral parts of our forces with units larger than battalions, and expand their number to properly support our armed forces."
 AUS_focus_creation_of_a_military_railway_department:0 "Creation of a Military Railway Department"
 AUS_focus_creation_of_a_military_railway_department_desc:0 "The railways present an unprecedented opportunity for changing the ways our men are mobilized, and the speed at which this can be done. To properly make use of this we must create a designated military railway department before our neighbors can use the same technology to defeat us."

 AUS_focus_maintain_the_military_budget_desc:0 ""
 AUS_focus_raise_new_taxes:0 "Raise New Taxes"
 AUS_focus_raise_new_taxes_desc:0 "With the cooperation of the Reichsrat, we will raise new taxes for the expansion and reform of our military. The Reichsrat respects the need for a strong Austrian military for the unity of our empire, and only needed reassurance that a minister was appointed that respects them like they respect the military."
 AUS_focus_army_costs:0 ""
 AUS_focus_army_costs_desc:0 ""
 AUS_focus_an_austrian_general_staff:0 "An Austrian General Staff"
 AUS_focus_an_austrian_general_staff_desc:0 "Although many powerful generals are opposed to it, Austria can no longer resist the formation of a modern General Staff in the style of our Prussian neighbors. We will merge together our current Adjutanten Corps with our Staff Corps into one General Staff, which with modern technology will be able to coordinate our entire military."
 AUS_focus_exams_for_promoted_officers:0 "Exams for Promoted Officers"
 AUS_focus_exams_for_promoted_officers_desc:0 "We already have examinations for our officers when they enlist and certain special cases. We should expand this system to further assess the capabilities of our officers.

 AUS_focus_an_austrian_breechloader_rifle:0 "An Austrian Breechloader Rifle"
 AUS_focus_an_austrian_breechloader_rifle_desc:0 "With the Emperor relenting and Degenfeld as war minister, we can finally replace the Lorenz Rifle with a modern breechloader. Despite the disparaging words of our generals about the usefulness of a high rate of fire, we will not permit Austria to continue to use an outdated rifle. However, we will have to see how well our often furloughed soldiers will adjust to learning an entirely new and innovative rifle."
 AUS_focus_cooperation_with_steyr:0 "Cooperation with Steyr"
 AUS_focus_cooperation_with_steyr_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the Vienna Arsenal does not have the ability to produce enough of our new rifles on its own, as it needs to be completely retooled and upgraded. Instead, we will also have to rely on the private sector with Josef Werndl's rifle factory in Steyr to meet our needs."
 AUS_focus_cavalry_reorganization:0 "Cavalry Reorganization"
 AUS_focus_cavalry_reorganization_desc:0 "The heavy cavalry is exorbitantly expensive, and was of little use during our last military operations. Our tactics remain focused on the cavalry charge, but this tactic has become less practical and more dangerous lately with the development of new weapon types. In light of this we must reorganize our cavalry to both cut down costs and improve their effectiveness in battle."
 AUS_focus_edelsheim_gyulais_proposal:0 "Edelsheim-Gyulai's Proposal"
 AUS_focus_edelsheim_gyulais_proposal_desc:0 "Major General Edelsheim-Gyulai has proposed that our cavalry be reorganized to convert many of our heavy and unwieldy troops into light cavalry. His intention is that our cavalry will be high speed, highly maneuverable, as well as being trained for dismounted action and reconnaissance alongside more traditional cavalry combat. Hopefully with these changes our cavalry will be able to prove its worth in this modern era."
 AUS_focus_artillery_modernization:0 "Artillery Modernization"
 AUS_focus_artillery_modernization_desc:0 "The usefulness of more modern forms of artillery can no longer be denied. We must modernize both our weapon systems as well as their operation to ensure that we can keep our place as a premier power of Europe, or our enemies might blow us away before we can even reach them!"
 AUS_focus_muzzle_loading_cannons:0 "Muzzle-Loading Cannons"
 AUS_focus_muzzle_loading_cannons_desc:0 "Despite advances in modern cannonry, our muzzle-loaders still serve us well in terms of return on investment, and our generals have suggested that they still perform well when brought up against breech-loading cannons. Instead of starting from scratch, we will design improved muzzle-loading cannons based on our experience with rifled muzzle-loaders."
 AUS_focus_lorenz_rifle_modernization:0 "Lorenz Rifle Modernization"
 AUS_focus_lorenz_rifle_modernization_desc:0 "The Lorenz Rifle fits our poorly educated infantry best, and its accuracy and range will prove superior compared to the so-called 'modern' rifles. Instead, let us improve the rifle to both make it easier to produce and ensure its performance can match other rifles."
 AUS_focus_cooperation_with_the_vienna_arsenal:0 "Cooperation with the Vienna Arsenal"
 AUS_focus_cooperation_with_the_vienna_arsenal_desc:0 "The Vienna Arsenal already produces a large number of Lorenz Rifles, but it is currently unable to meet the full demand of our armed forces. We will upgrade and replace the machinery of the arsenal to ensure that it can produce enough weapons to meet our needs."
 AUS_focus_new_infantry_regulations:0 "New Infantry Regulations"
 AUS_focus_new_infantry_regulations_desc:0 "Now that we have updated our equipment and cavalry doctrines, we must bring changes to our infantry in the form of new regulations. Fast columns and bayonet charges have proven extremely effective, and we plan to adopt the use of these daring tactics in the Austrian land forces. We will show the world the Austrian soldier is still a force to be reckoned with!"

 AUS_focus_keep_the_adjutantenkorps:0 "Keep the Adjutantenkorps"
 AUS_focus_keep_the_adjutantenkorps_desc:0 "While Degenfeld wishes to merge the Adjutanten Corps and the Staff Corps, Benedek sees no use in abandoning Grünne's ideas to copy the style of the unproven and overly intellectual Prussian General Staff. Instead, we will keep both as our current institutions to meet our own needs."
 AUS_focus_rely_on_senior_officers:0 "Rely on Senior Officers"
 AUS_focus_rely_on_senior_officers_desc:0 "Our senior officers represent the accumulation of all Austrian military knowledge, and we should rely on them rather than younger potentially radical officers. The fact that they are mostly conservative and aristocratic is simply a wonderful coincidence. If we can encourage them to stay in active service for longer, we will also save money on pensions and pay for new officers."
 AUS_focus_abolish_the_landwehr:0 "Abolish the Landwehr"
 AUS_focus_abolish_the_landwehr_desc:0 "The Landwehr failed in it's purpose to defend the Empire during the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809 which was one of the most humiliating defeats in our recent history in which we lost the Illyrian provinces to France, West Galicia to the Duchy of Warsaw, Tyrol and Salzburg to Bavaria and Ternopil to Russia."
 AUS_focus_ban_non_german_military_magazines:0 "Ban Non-German Military Magazines"
 AUS_focus_ban_non_german_military_magazines_desc:0 "While military magazines may be useful for teaching our officers, publications outside of the military's official language represent a danger to the loyalty of our Non-German soldiers. In order to prevent any traitorous ideas from being spread we will issue a blanket ban on all Non-German magazines being used in our military."
 AUS_focus_osterreichische_militarische_zeitschrift:0 "Österreichische Militärische Zeitschrift"
 AUS_focus_osterreichische_militarische_zeitschrift_desc:0 "In recognition of the usefulness of military magazines and journals, we will officially promote the traditional Austrian military magazine that all officers will be encouraged to subscribe to. The content within these magazines should help keep our officers educated as well as improve morale and loyalty."
 AUS_focus_follow_hauslabs_ideas:0 "Follow Hauslab's Ideas"
 AUS_focus_follow_hauslabs_ideas_desc:0 "The so-called 'Stoßtaktik' is madness! Our men will throw their lives away without proper support. Instead, if infantry assaults must be done we should combine them with overwhelming artillery fire to destroy resistance before our infantry reaches the enemy lines, saving our men's lives and truly guaranteeing our victory."
 AUS_focus_implement_the_stosstaktik:0 "Implement the Stoßtaktik"
 AUS_focus_implement_the_stosstaktik_desc:0 "The bayonet has proven itself as the best choice of infantry weapon and our tactics must reflect this. We will focus our strategies on bayonet charges and the famed bravery of our soldiers will prove triumphant over all our enemies!"
 
 AUS_Reform_The_Landwehr:0 "Reform the Landwehr"
 AUS_Reform_The_Landwehr_desc:0 "Also known as the ¨Home Guard, Landwehr was established during the Napoleonic Wars as a guard seperated from the Austrian Army with a sole purpose of defending the nation from Napoleon's further conquests, and should be reformed so it can protect our nation in the future."
 AUS_Learn_From_The_Old_Guard:0 "Learn from the Old Guard"
 AUS_Learn_From_The_Old_Guard_desc:0 "Times might have changed but our Guard has not, they resisted the army reform in 1806 and didn't use new tactics unless the Archduke Karl was around which just goes to show that you can't teach old dog new tricks."
 AUS_New_Generals_New_Tatics:0 "New Generals, New Tactics"
 AUS_New_Generals_New_Tatics_desc:0 "Times have changed and so have the army tactics, the line infantry is not going to make the cut anymore, Napoleon conquered Europe with his artillery and superior logistics so we should learn from our mistakes and put them under the spotlight."

But we cannot allow them to do anything they please when they please. The war between pro-Austrian and pro-Prussian states has been declared if we couldn't solve our diffrences diplomatically we will solve them on the battlefield. The war for Germany has begun."

 AUS_Halt_Und_Verstarken_desc:0 "Even though they have the audacity to declare war on the Germany's strongest Bismarck isn't a fool, he seems to be implementing an idea of a fast and decisive warfare instead of old-schooled mass charges, we have to settle down and not let him and his troops to take an inch of our land, furthermore we have to make quick use of his strategies for our own good for the good of Germany, now onwards to Berlin."

His reforms were seen as the reason of such a loss, weakening the industrial potential of Austria. He leaves the position empty, and a new Interior Minister needs to be appointed.

Two options are presented to us for the regnal position: Louis Lucien Bonaparte and Carlo Ludovico di Bourbon Parma.\nLouis Lucien Bonaparte is a scion of the Bonaparte familly, the third son of Napoleon Bonaparte's second brother. He is a rather uninspiring man but he can be easily manipulated by Austria and speaks fluently Italian. In addition to that his crowning will certainly improve our relationship with [FRA.GetNameDEF].\nCarlo Ludovico di Bourbon Parma, also known as Charles II of Parma, is the former Duke of Parma who had to abdicate in favour of his son in 1849 due to the pressure from the liberals in the Duchy. Ever since then he has been wandering Europe but he would certainly not disaprove of assuming a title much more significant than his former one. Carlo is however more of a liberal and even though he may assuage the Italians he may not always follow our course of action."

 # Austrian Leader Descriptions #
 ################################
 
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_BACH_DESC:0 "Baron Alexander von Bach serves as the Interior Minister of the Habsburg Monarchy and is the de facto leader of Austria in the matters of internal politics. The Baron comes from a family with a long history in the matter of law, and he himself is a Doctor of Laws and a loyal servant of the Empire. Ever since he took power, in 1849 during the Revolution, he has sought to depart from Metternich's overcontrolling system but at the same time has kept much of Metternich's principles in practice in his Klerikalabsolutist form of governance. The Baron favours centralising the Empire, with Vienna as the center of everything, and to maintain loyalty to the Emperor through a rigorous use of the secret police. The Baron is also, like most Conservative members of the Government, a supporter of the Catholic Church within Austria. Even though he enjoys he the support of the Emperor and of most German-Austrians, the Baron's policies have deeply dissatisfied the other ethnic groups in the Empire, and perhaps in due time it will be revealed his policies might have done more harm than good when it comes to the loyalty of Franz Joseph's subjects..."
 ANTON_VON_SCHMERLING_DESC:0 "Anton Ritter von Schmerling is the first Liberal Interior Minister of the Austrian Empire since the Congress of Vienna. Born in Vienna he studied law and for over twenty years served as a public servant in Lower Austria. He rose to prominence during the Revolutions of 1848 when he became President of the Confederate Diet. He supported the Government of Archduke John and quelled the revolt that broke out in Frankfurt.He returned to Vienna with the collapse of the Revolutions and became Minister of Justice until his resignation in 1851. Anton von Schmerling is a Liberal and a Centralist: he belives Austria should become a fully unitary state with a parliamentary government. While his ideas are seen with suspicion from the nobility and the Conservatives, he is seen as a man who might be able to unite the different ethnic groups under German power. The Emperor has put a lot of trust in him, and it remains to be seen what von Schmerling can accomplish."
 AGENOR_GOLUCHOWSKI_DESC:0 "Count Agenor Romuald Gołuchowski was appointed to replace Baron Alexander von Bach as Interior Minister. He is a Conservative and an aristocrat from Galicia and a close advisor to the Emperor, furthermore he has had a successful tenure as Governor of Galicia where he did several projects benefitting the poor region. The Count will oversee the creation of a Constitution liberal enough to satisfy the populace. Nonetheless, he might not be charismatic enough to reconcile all the different ethnic groups within the Empire..."
 ARCHDUKE_RAINIER_DESC:0 "Archduke Rainier Ferdinand of Austria is one of the several senior members of the Habsburg Monarchy. The Archduke studied law in Vienna and as most male members of the Monarchy he joined the Imperial Army. He married his cousine Archduchess Marie Karoline of Austria in 1852, which was to prove a very happy marriage. The Archduke was only mildly interested in politics, but he was seen as a perfect person to continue absolutism in the Empire by the court and so was appointed as Interior Minister by Franz Joseph. The Archduke is perhaps what the Empire needs, a pragmatic leader, though like the Emperor, perhaps slightly inert. Most of the actual power falls within the Absolutist faction within the court, and it is their job to ensure all men and women in the Empire are loyal subjects to His Majesty."
 RICHARD_VON_BELCREDI_DESC:0 "Count Richard von Belcredi was appointed to replace Anton von Schmerling as the Interior Minister. The Count stems from Margraviate of Moravia, though his familly descends from Lombardy, and studied law in Prague and then Vienna. Already a member of the Landtag since 1861, he is a seasoned bureaucrat and an opponent to the so called 'Compromise' with the Hungarians. The Count instead supports that the Empire becomes federalised, though in a conservative way where the local nobles retain essentially all power, in order to combat the various separatist movements. It is ultimately up to the Emperor whether Count von Belcredi will stay for long as Interior Minister, or he will be replaced with a more accomodating politician, as Anton von Schmerling was."
 FRIEDRICH_FERDINAND_VON_BEUST_DESC:0 "Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust is an odd choice for Minister-President, he is both a Saxon and a Protestant. Despite this, he is a clear opponent of Prussia, which so gravely offended us, as well as a very competent statesman. It is hope the Count will bring to an end the negotiations with the Magyars and restore faith to the Monarchy. It is time that misfortune ends and a new period of peace and stability is ushered..."
