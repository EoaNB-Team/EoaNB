 worker_unrest_generic_vote_discrimination_event_1.1.d: "Protester have congregated outside a government building in [FROM.GetName] demanding equal voting opportunities for all people. While the law on the books allow anyone to vote, arbitrary policies, like poll tests and voting fees, discriminate against those who cannot read, cannot afford voting fees, or have a lack of formal education. Often those that are able to vote are turned away at the polls or their voting registration papers are declined.\n\nIndividuals hired from companies have gathered to intimidate the protesters and tensions between the two are high. To make matters more tense, many of the local officials are apathetic towards the working class protesters and any violence done against them will likely be overlooked.\n\nDomestic affairs like this are typically handled by local officials, but we have the opportunity to intervene here if we can afford to pull a few strings."
