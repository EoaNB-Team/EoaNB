#General Events
saxony.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Saxony –\nStarting Situation: Domestic Policy"
saxony.1.d:0 "\n[SAX.GetNameDef] has been heavily involved in the revolutionary uprisings of 1830 and 1848/49. Public pressure mainly exerted by intellectuals and academics in Leipzig and Dresden led to the adoption of a relatively progressive constitution in 1831, which turned the kingdom into a constitutional monarchy, including public elections for the second chamber of the Landtag.\n\nIn the meantime, the [SAX.GetName] was the first country in Germany to experience the rapid changes brought about by the industrial revolution. Primarily around the cities of Chemnitz and Zwickau, a large number of factories were built, mainly specialized in the textile and mechanical engineering industry. With that arose a new social class: the industrial proletariat, which grew increasingly unhappy with the poor labor conditions and a lack of political representation.\n\nFueled by general unhappiness and high unemployment, Saxony was one of the centers of the March Revolution of 1848/49. Violent outbursts forced the king to change the government multiple times, appoint more progressive ministers, end press censorship, and liberalize suffrage laws. As the forces of reaction tried to take back control, bloody street battles ensued after the king had dissolved the Landtag and Prussian troops intervened in Dresden, leaving several hundreds dead. The forces loyal to the crown eventually prevailed, and most of the concessions were revoked.\n\n[SAX.GetNameDef] now finds itself at a crossroads. Whilst aristocrats are clinging on to their privileges, the public demands progress and liberalization, and there's also the question how to handle growing nationalist sentiments among the Sorbs. It will be important to find a balance, develop our economy, and ensure another revolt is prevented, if we want Saxony to thrive and prosper."
saxony.1.a:0 "Glück auf, Glück auf, mein Sachsenland!"
saxony.2.t:0 "Ferdinand von Zschinsky Terminally Ill - Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust Appointed Acting Prime Minister"
saxony.2.d:0 "Prime Minister von Zschinsky had already been in bad health for roughly two years when he embarked on convalescent leave to Southern France and Italy earlier this year, as requested by King Johann. According to the doctors, the prime minister is suffering from a chronic lung condition that can only be cured by a change of climate. The journey did not, however, significantly improve his health, and von Zschinsky returned to Dresden three weeks ago. Earlier today, sad news reached king and parliament: von Zschinsky has fallen dangerously sick and will be unable to carry out his ministerial duties for the foreseeable future. The doctor in charge of von Zschinsky's therapy has made no secret of his doubts whether the prime minister will recover at all...\n\nHis Majesty, King Johann, has already appointed von Zschinsky's longstanding political adversary, foreign minister Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust, as Acting Prime Minister. Von Beust is known for his liberal-conservative agenda and wants to put Saxony back on the diplomatic map of Europe. Von Zschinsky's deteriorating health might have initiated a significant change in Saxon politics."
saxony.2.a:0 "Zschinsky's days seem to be numbered..."
saxony.3.t:0 "Death of Ferdinand von Zschinsky"
saxony.3.d:0 "After a few days of death throes, Prime Minister Ferdinand von Zschinsky died earlier this morning. His ten years in government as head of the Ministry of the Interior and, finally, prime minister, made von Zschinsky a well-known figure in not only Saxon but also German politics. His juridical prowess also earned him the respect of his colleagues and lawmakers across Europe. A recipient of the Grand Cross of the Saxon Civil Order of Merit, the Imperial Austrian Order of the Iron Crown, and the Imperial Russian Order of Saint Anna, among others, von Zschinsky will be dearly missed and receive an honourable burial."
saxony.3.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
saxony.4.t:0 "Death of Ferdinand Lassalle"
saxony.4.d:0 "Reports are coming in that Ferdinand Lassalle has been confirmed dead. Being a devout socialist and pro-monarchist at the same time, Lassalle was an ideologically conflicting man. He maintained relations with both the arch-communist Karl Marx and the arch-monarchist Otto von Bismarck. Although some will claim that Lassalle was a communist, in the end, he was the same thing that Bismarck was: a nationalist at heart, willing to undertake any social ideology to achieve the goal of a united Germany. His untimely death will surely be a severe blow to moderate socialism in Germany, as the movement loses its most brilliant thinker."
saxony.4.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."

#Foreign Policy
saxonyforeign.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Saxony –\nStarting Situation: Foreign Affairs"
saxonyforeign.1.d:0 "\n[SAX.GetNameDef] is in a difficult position geographically. Sandwiched between the two German hegemons, the [PRS.GetName] and the [AUS.GetName], and bordering the third German power, the [BAV.GetName] to the south, the government will have to tread carefully, especially on the international stage.\n\nWhilst membership in the Zollverein is of vital economic importance, our relationship to the Zollverein's leading power, Prussia, has not been the greatest. In fact, Saxony had nearly been annexed completely by the [PRS.GetName] during the Vienna Congress of 1815, as a punishment for siding with Napoleon until the last minute.\n\nOnly the intervention of the [AUS.GetName] prevented the complete incorporation of our kingdom into the Prussian state back then, but we still lost over half of our territory and nearly 40% of our population as part of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna. The days when we were considered a European middle power are over, and we only barely managed to prevent the Prussian unification initiative after the March Revolution, known as the Erfurt Union.\n\nWe will have to decide how to proceed from here. We made some promising progress working with the other German minors lately and continuing down this path should be our best option, although it might be hard to get all parties involved on the same page. At the same time we should be careful not to antagonize Austria and Prussia, or our days as an independent country could be numbered..."

#Sorbian Events
saxonysorbs.1.t:0 "The Sorbian Question"
saxonysorbs.1.d:0 "The Sorbs are a West Slavic ethnic group predominantly inhabiting Lusatia, the northwestern part of our realm. As a result of the Vienna Congress of 1815, a large part of the Sorbian lands was seized by the [PRS.GetName], but still there are around 65,000 Sorbs living in the [SAX.GetName]. Sorbian nationalism has been on the rise lately, especially in the context of the March Revolution of 1848/49, and many Sorbian intellectuals hold Panslavic sentiments and maintain ties to other Slavic intellectuals in the east. The latest developments have been increasingly worrying and now we must decide how to proceed with the Sorbian question."
saxonysorbs.1.a:0 "We need to accept their expression of identity."
saxonysorbs.1.b:0 "We will continue to basically ignore the matter."
saxonysorbs.1.c:0 "We need to assimilate them at all costs!"
saxonysorbs.2.t:0 "Formation of the Sorbian Written Language"
saxonysorbs.2.d:0 "For centuries, the Sorbs, a West Slavic ethnic minority situated mainly in Lusatia, have mainly communicated and passed down their traditions and history orally. Although there had been written forms of the Sorbian dialects before, they were very inconsistent and mutual intelligibility was not a given. For a few decades now, Sorbian intellectuals have been working hard to establish a fixed grammar, a set of rules that govern the Sorbian language and its dialects. This has strengthened Sorbian nationalism and self-awareness, and we should expect more Sorbian literary, historiographic and linguistic publications in the future."
saxonysorbs.2.a:0 "Well, good for them."
saxonysorbs.3.t:0 "Decennial Anniversary of the Maćica Serbska"
saxonysorbs.3.d:0 "The so-called Maćica Serbska is an influential Sorbian scientific society. Founded in the Lusatian town of Bautzen in 1847, many Sorbian intellectuals like Handrij Zejler (picture) and Jan Arnošt Smoler have found and continue to find inspiration and a common cause in the advancement of the Sorbian culture in the Maćica Serbska. The society has played a key role in the establishment of a Sorbian grammar and literature and will most likely continue to function as a nucleus of Sorbian identity."
saxonysorbs.3.a:0 "We need to watch them."
saxonysorbs.4.t:0 "Serbske Nowiny - Sorbian Journal"
saxonysorbs.4.d:0 "The first Sorbian journal was established in 1842 by Handrij Zejler, who was later joined by Jan Arnošt Smoler. In 1854, the journal was renamed into 'Serbske Nowiny' - Sorbian Newspaper - and circulation has been greatly improved since then. Especially among Protestant Sorbs it exerts significant influence and we have to watch the publishers' activities closely. Our predecessors have already prohibited the paper from printing news regarding foreign affairs, and we will continue to do so for now."
saxonysorbs.4.a:0 "They need to be controlled."
saxonysorbs.5.t:0 "New Lusatian Magazine - 40th Anniversary"
saxonysorbs.5.d:0 "The New Lusatian Magazine, or 'Neues Lausitzisches Magazin', is the publication organ of the Upper Lusatian Society of the Sciences, a scholarly society based in Görlitz. Although the society and its magazine do not specifically agitate Sorbian nationalism and identity, if offers a platform to many Sorbian intellectuals, and their publications resonate with the liberal-progressive bourgeoisie in Saxony and Prussia. Let's hope the scientific advantages outweigh the dangers some of those dissidents pose."
saxonysorbs.5.a:0 "Not so new anymore, huh?"
saxonysorbs.6.t:0 "Foundation of the Katolski Posoł - Catholic Sorbian Magazine"
saxonysorbs.6.d:0 "Recently founded by Michał Hórnik, the Katolski Posoł - Catholic Herald - is a Sorbian magazine aiming specifically at Catholic Sorbs. Whilst religious in character, the magazine could also be used to secretly agitate Sorbian separatist tendencies. We should have an eye on their publications."
saxonysorbs.6.a:0 "Catholic Sorbians might also be dangerous..."
saxonysorbs.7.t:0 "Slawisches Zentralblatt - a Weekly Journal with Panslavic Tendencies"
saxonysorbs.7.d:0 "Jan Arnošt Smoler has recently established another Sorbian Journal, the 'Slawisches Zentralblatt' - Slavic Central Journal, published in German. The subtitle reads 'für Literatur, Kunst, Wissenschaft und nationale Interessen des Gesamtslawentums' - for Literature, Art, Science, and the national interests of all Slavs. Smoler does not bother to cover the Panslavic tendencies of this publication and we will have to make sure to limit and hamper its circulation."
saxonysorbs.7.a:0 "Sorbian intellectuals reaching out to Russia, alarming..."
saxonysorbs.8.t:0 "Lusatian-Lower Sorbian Dictionary Published"
saxonysorbs.8.d:0 "The Sorbian minority is linguistically very different from their German neighbours, which makes mutual intelligibility difficult. The Sorbian language, commonly referred to as 'Wendisch' in Germany, now has a dictionary that makes translations into German and vice versa much easier for people with only little knowledge of both languages. Although using this dictionary would practically enhance the importance and rank of the Wendish language, it does sound like a good opportunity for mutual rapprochement."
saxonysorbs.8.a:0 "At least we can mutually understand each other now."
saxonysorbs.9.t:0 "Second Pan-Slav Congress in Vienna"
saxonysorbs.9.d:0 "A Sorbian delegations has participated in the Second Pan-Slav Congress in Vienna earlier this year. After the first Pan-Slav Congress in Prague in 1847, nationalist and separatist agitation among Slavs reached a boiling point across Eastern Europe, including the [SAX.GetName]. We must be very careful not to let these insurgents cause trouble again. We might have to strengthen our intelligence to deal with them."
saxonysorbs.9.a:0 "These Panslavic agitators must be stopped."

SAX_idea_anti_prussian_sentiments_desc:0 "Just over 40 years ago, Prussia stripped away 60% of Saxon territory as a result of the Congress of Vienna. Prussia was barely stopped from annexing the entire nation, it is clear they have little regard for the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Saxony. The Napoleonic Wars brought Prussia back to the table of the European great powers, and their ambition to unite all German states is most threatening to Saxon independence."

SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_1_desc:0 "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. For centuries, Saxons have forcibly assimilated Sorbs through a destruction of Sorbian culture, literature, and language. Recently, the Sorbs have become more boisterous, thousands of them call for an end to the assimilation, and the tensions now risk boiling over."

SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_2_desc:0 "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. The Sorbian national culture is currently enjoying its heyday in poetry, music, literature, and language. Nevertheless, the way of mutual recognition will probably ease tensions and assist in their peaceful assimilation in the long run."

#Country Leader Descriptions
SAX_FERDINAND_VON_ZSCHINSKY_LEADER_DESC:0 "Having studied and worked as a lawyer in the private, public, and aristocratic spheres, Ferdinand von Zschinsky served a two-week stint as the head of Saxony's Ministry of the Interior in 1848 before being appointed leader of the Saxon government by King Friedrich August II in 1849, an honour that eventually earned him an aristocratic title in 1856.\n\nZschinsky's leadership has been ideologically mixed: one of his government's first actions was the dissolution of the Saxon State Parliament and the reinstatement of the less liberal 1831 constitution (a major reversal of concessions made in the wake of the 1848 revolutions), but on the other hand he has also stripped feudal landlords of their legal jurisdiction and separated the powers of the state and judiciary.\n\nWhile his time in office has been consequential for Saxony, Ferdinand von Zschinsky is in ailing health, and he likely does not have much more time to lead."
