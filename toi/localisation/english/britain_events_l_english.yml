 britain.1.t:0 "\"The Great Stink\""
 britain.1.d:0 "The Thames has become increasingly more polluted by sewer connections and industrial outlets during the last few years, and now the situation has, quite literally, overboiled. The hot temperatures this month have made water in the river evaporate, so that huge piles of industrial and human waste products remained on its banks, combining with the hot air to generate a stink that is so unbearable, boat travel on the river has almost completely stopped and noone dares step near it anymore to preserve their own wellbeing. We must do something about this!"
 britain.1.a:0 "Disgusting!"
 britain.2.t:0 "The Sea Cable to America"
 britain.2.d:0 "Last night British and American diplomats celebrated as a sea cable from Cardiff to Boston that had been lain for the past few months was finally completed. While not being the first of such undersea cables, and while not fully functional yet, it is still revolutionary in allowing for rapid communication between us and the Americans, and we can only expect an expansion of this network in the future."
 britain.2.a:0 "A wondrous thing, the march of technology."
 britain.3.t:0 "The Irish Republican Brotherhood"
 britain.3.d:0 "It's not out of the ordinary for St. Patrick's day to result in the occasional drunken Irishman attacking British Police while yelling about Independence. What is new however, is that the Irish Seperatists have now founded an organization in Dublin, called the \"Irish Republican Brotherhood\". Their goal is to end British Rule in Ireland - what should be done about it?"
 britain.3.a:0 "We will watch their every move."
 britain.3.b:0 "Send in the military police and dismantle the organization!"
 britain.3.c:0 "Maybe they are right - we should grant Ireland regional autonomy."
 britain.4.t:0 "\"The Critique of Political Economy\""
 britain.4.d:0 "Popular political author Karl Marx, residing in the city of London, has published yet another book, in which he attacks the current economy in our country and the idea of capitalism in general, while also discussing the political implications of the system. While it doesn't seem to sell very well as of now, it could still cause an unwanted stir - the question now is: Should we do anything to intervene?"
 britain.4.a:0 "This better not cause any trouble."
 britain.4.b:0 "Ban this book immediately!"

If it is passed, it would prohibit the publication of material that could be considered obscene to the general public, including but not limited to imagery displaying nudity, sex, excessive drinking or swearing and otherwise offensive material. Liberals are up in arms over the act, while many conservatives support it. After a vote, the parliament has decided..."
 britain.6.a:0 "...that our society is better off without this smut."
 britain.6.b:0 "...that we cannot allow this repression of the arts and free speech."
 britain.7.t:0 "Prison Hulk catches fire in Woolwich!"

The remaining parts of the ship are already being scrapped in Shipyards, and Parliament is now voting on a proposition to stop the use of wooden prison hulks in home waters."
 britain.7.a:0 "How horrible!"
 britain.8.t:0 "The world's first Football Team"
 britain.8.d:0 "Football is a relatively new sport that has been conquering the hearts of our people for a few decades, and now the sport is going professional: The first official football team, the Sheffield FC, was founded yesterday in Sheffield. If the popularity of football continues to rise in this fashion, it may even become a popular international sport someday!"
 britain.8.a:0 "Good for them!"
 britain.8.b:0 "What nonsense! They should play a gentleman's sport instead..."

Liberals and Egalitarians are happy to see we are doing our best to abolish societal discrimination in [ENG.GetNameDef] - although the whole ordeal has been met with criticism from anti-semites, and from the more radical religious factions..."
 britain.12.a:0 "Good luck to him then."
 britain.12.b:0 "A jew in parliament?! Evict him!"
 britain.12.c:0 "A non-christian in parliament?! Evict him!"
 britain.13.t:0 "Spain sells Equatorial Guinea"

 britain.14.d:0 "A horrible accident occurred in Bradford, a small town near Leeds yesterday when it was discovered that 21 had died and at least 200 were poisoned in an event where on a sale of sweets, arsenic had been used accidentally during the production process.

 britain.15.t:0 "National Portrait Gallery opens in London"
 britain.15.d:0 "After years of construction and preparations, the national portrait gallery has finally opened in London! This already culturally significant institution displays portraits from artists all about [ENG.GetNameDef], and art critics are seemingly impressed."

 britain.16.t:0 "\"All the Year Round\""
 britain.16.d:0 "Charles Dickens, most famous author of [ENG.GetNameDef], has just started publishing his new magazine, \"All the Year Round\". For this, he has already begun serializing books like his \"Tale of Two Cities\" to appear in the magazine - it's the golden age of literature for our country, as it would seem."
 britain.16.a:0 "A busy man, this Mr. Dickens."
 britain.17.t:0 "Astronomer observes \"Solar Flare\""
 britain.17.d:0 "Richard Cristopher Carrington, a renowned astronomer from West London claims to have observed something completely new last night, something he calls a \"solar flare\". These sudden flashes of brightness on the sun, as he describes them, have never been observed before and the physicists are up and excited about the implications this has for earth - Carrington himself has even already suggested the magnetic field of our planet might be affected by this. Our universe is truly amazing..."
 britain.17.a:0 "A curious phenomenon!"
 britain.18.t:0 "Massive Storm hits the British Isles!"
 britain.18.d:0 "The biggest storm to hit Britain this century so far has devastated coastal regions last night as gigantic waves and devastating winds blew for several hours throughout the evening. Up to 130 naval vessels, mostly trade hulls have been reported to been sunk or ran ashore, and up to 800 people are reported missing or dead. Some of our more radical priests are calling this God's punishment for our sins already - true or not, the disaster has shaken the country. Time to start rebuilding."
 britain.18.a:0 "What a tragedy!"
 britain.19.t:0 "Walker found on Honduras!"
 britain.19.d:0 "Famous Filibuster and American Mercenary William Walker, the former president of Nicaragua and the one that caused a lot of trouble to our Central American allies and to some of our army in Miskito. Walker and what was left of his army were allowed to reorganize in the Miskito Coast by some sympathizers. The Filibuster then invaded Honduras with a force of 91 man and began to march to Nicaragua, but he was stopped by Honduran troops. He is bringing in reinforcements, what should we do?"
 britain.19.a:0 "Block the coast and bring him to justice. Get rid of William Walker!"
 britain.19.b:0 "Let him go. Nothing will happen anyways."
 britain.20.t:0 "Return of Walker"
 britain.20.d:0 "William Walker, American filibuster who has tried to conquer Baja California, Sonora and most of Central America has returned and he reunited a militia that took control of Tegucigalpa in days and he installed himself as the new president of Honduras. This has been met with enormous backlash from both Nicaragua and El Salvador, that requested for him to resign or war would happen. Walker refused to resign and it seems that Walker's misadventures are leading to another war."
 britain.20.a:0 "Walker is still alive? What?!"
 britain.20.b:0 "This time we'll make sure he's dead!"
 britain.20.c:0 "Not again!"
 britain.21.t:0 "British Tourists In Switzerland"
 britain.21.d:0 "In 1863, a British travel agency carried out the first organised tour to Switzerland. This paved the way for tourism in Switzerland and at the same time provided an incentive for the construction of the railway network in Switzerland. British tourists still account for the third-largest group of foreign visitors to Switzerland today."
 britain.21.a:0 "Maybe, we'll colonize them too..."
 britain.22.t:0 "The Golden Age of Alpinism (1854-1865)"
 britain.22.d:0 "The Golden Age of Alpinism is the period between Alfred Will's (1828-1912) ascent of Wetterhorn in 1854 and Edward Whymper's (1840-1911) ascent of Matterhorn in 1865. Both climbers were English. Many major Alpine peaks met their first ascents during the period. Although Alfred Will's ascent was not the first one, people commemorate the latter ascent, which marked the start of the Golden Age of Alpinism. The Golden Age of Alpinism was dominated by British Alpine climbers accompanied by Swiss and French guides. The era ended with Whymper's ascent of the Matterhorn, which caused death of 4 people; 3 well-known British Alpinists and 1 French Alpine guide. There had been 64 successful assaults on Mont Blanc during the period 1852 to 1857, and only 4 of them were not British."
 britain.22.a:0 "Even the mountains bow to the British Empire!"
 britain.23.t:0 "The Silver Age of Alpinism (1865-1882)"
 britain.23.d:0 "The Silver Age of Alpinism began after the Edward Whymper's ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 and ended with William Woodman Graham (1859-1932) ascent of the Dent du Geant in 1882. While the Golden Age of Alpinism (1854-1865) was characterized by the first ascents of many of the Alps' most dominant mountains, the subsequent silver age may be seen as consisting of the first ascents of those few worthwhile peaks left unclimbed, although these peaks were - and remained - largely unknown to the wider public. Many mountaineers from different nations joined the group of leading ascendants of Alps. Although British mountaineers did not dominate the era, still a lot of famous mountaineers in the Silver Age of Alpinism were British, such as Clinton Thomas Dent (1850-1912). His first ascents in the Alps include the Lenzspitze of the Pennie Alps (1870). There is a record that Queen Victoria of the Great Britain had spent her holiday in 1868, in Lucerne, Switzerland. This later derived more British attention on Switzerland."
 britain.23.a:0 "Interesting"
 britain.24.t:0 "John Stuart Mill - On Liberty, 1858"
 britain.24.d:0 "\"On Liberty\" is a philosophical work by the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, originally intended as a short essay. The work, published in 1859, applies Mill's ethical system of utilitarianism to society and the state. Mill attempts to establish standards for the relationship between authority and liberty. He emphasizes the importance of individuality, which he conceived as a prerequisite to the higher pleasures—the summum bonum of utilitarianism. Furthermore, Mill criticizes the errors of past attempts to defend individuality where, for example, democratic ideals resulted in the "tyranny of the majority". Among the standards established in this work are Mill's three basic liberties of individuals, his three legitimate objections to government intervention, and his two maxims regarding the relationship of the individual to society."
 britain.24.a:0 "An interesting book..."
 britain.24.b:0 "What a bunch of rubish!"
 britain.25.t:0 "The Panic Of 1862"
 britain.25.d:0 "In London fear of crime was a persistent, reoccurring issue thanks to a few instances of robbery and murder, and, of course, the news media. In particular, the so-called “garrotting” cases, where someone strangles someone else, often using their arm or a length of wire, cord, or cloth, seemed to touch the rawest nerve with the people of London, with the fear of garrotting reaching a fever-pitch in the 1860s. The weird thing about garrotting and how widely it was reported at the time is that it doesn’t actually appear to have been all that common; even during the supposed height of the “garrotting panic of 1862”. So why the panic? As it turns out, although garrotting itself was never a major problem in London, newspapers from the era positively loved reporting on it. This led to the few isolated cases that did happen being blown way out of proportion and reported on to such an extent that the people of London were led to believe the streets were filled to the brim with roving rabbles of ruffians armed with lengths of wire."
 britain.25.a:0 "Interesting"
 britain.26.t:0 "\"A journey through space\""
 britain.26.d:0 "A very renowned scientist from Scotland named William Leitch has recently published an essay named \"A journey through space\" in which he introduces an entirely new concept: The use of rockets, as would be used in artillery, to travel \"outside the bounds of earth and through space\"! Dreamers and technological enthusiasts are up in arms debating about the feasibility of this, but with how rocketry has been practiced and not changed for the last few centuries, experts estimate there is probably no chance of something like this being ever possible."
 britain.26.a:0 "What a ridiculous proposal!"
 britain.26.b:0 "If nothing else, it serves as a nice reminder to divert funding into rocket artillery technology."
 britain.27.t:0 "Pince Consort Albert"
 britain.27.d:0 "Whereas there was this day read at the Board the draft of Letters Patent, confering upon His Royal Highness Prince Albert the title and dignity of Prince Consort. Her Majesty, having taken the same into consideration, was pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privacy Council, to approve thereof, and to order, as it is hereby ordered, that the Right Honourable Sir George Grey, Baronet, one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do cause a Warrant to be prepared for Her Majesty's signature, forpassing Letters Patent conformable to the said draft under the Great Seal of Great Britain."
 britain.27.a:0 "The London Gazette publishes the news"
 britain.28.t:0 "Pince Consort Albert illness"
 britain.28.d:0 "The Prince Consort Albert fell seriously ill with stomach cramps. It was not an isolate event, the Prince suffers with chronic stomach troubles. He will continue to help the Queen Victoria in her duties."
 britain.28.a:0 "God save the Prince"
 britain.29.t:0 "Royal Marriage offer from Prussia"
 britain.29.d:0 ""
 britain.29.a:0 "Accept the Offer."
 britain.29.b:0 "Reject the Offer."
 britain.30.t:0 "People don't approve the Marriage"
 britain.30.d:0 ""
 britain.30.a:0 "Who cares?!"
 britain.31.t:0 "Where should the marriage be arranged?"
 britain.31.d:0 ""
 britain.31.a:0 "In St.James Palace."
 britain.31.b:0 "In Berlin."
 britain.32.t:0 "Esteemed Veterans Awarded"
 britain.32.d:0 "Her Majesty the Queen today, in Hyde-Park, graciously introduced and awarded sixty-six of the first ever Victorian Crosses. Established in January of the previous year, this military award is given only to Britain's most brave and most gentleman of warriors. Who, in troubled times, stood with absolute valour in the face of absolute war. How better can one present such an honor then on a humble bronze cross, passionately decorated with the Lion of this nation, beneath which reads a simple but imposing declaration…"
 britain.32.a:0 "For Valour."
 britain.33.t:0 "Religious Riots in Ireland"
 britain.33.d:0 "Belfast's streets and walls run red with blood as the Irish-Catholics, Irish-Protestants, and local police clash. Our reports suggest that the police did in fact side with the Irish-Protestants, no doubt to show support for the shining Union we have with our green isle neighbors. The beloved [and calming] “Roaring” Hugh Hanna was present at the clashes, and many have quoted him as having exacerbated the situation by calling for violence and anti-catholic bigotry. If I were to give my professional opinion on this accusation, as an objective journalist of our Great Britain, I would have to conclude that such a thing is abhorrent. I would expect nothing less from those blessed by our stabling hand but swear fidelity to Rome. Elsewhere, in Derry, Portatown, and Lurgan, blood also runs."
 britain.33.a:0 "And this is how they thank us?"
 britain.34.t:0 "Mendelssohn's Wedding March"
 britain.34.d:0 "For the esteemed guests of Princess Victoria and Prince Friedrich's marriage ceremony at the austere St. James's Palace, a new melody graced their ears that, unbeknownst to them, would gain such cultural power that it would be played at nearly every wedding on the planet. This is but one among many examples of how reaching British culture is to this day. Though the sun may have already set on their empire, Britain is still due much respect for the music, language, clothing, and philosophies she helped to spread."
 britain.34.a:0 "They can keep their wedding songs, and mashed peas for all I care."
 britain.35.t:0 "The Clayton-Bulwar Treaty"
 britain.35.d:0 "We and the Americans have long debated the status of the Moskito Coast in Central America. We have long held that since this part of central america is part of our colony Belize, and the Americans have in the past tolerated our settlement there, they should tolerate this as well. They are of the opinion this is a separate matter entirely, and want to restore these lands to their 'rightful owners' Honduras and Nicuragua. Should we acede to these demands?"
 britain.35.a:0 "Why keep such a disease-ridden place?"
 britain.35.b:0 "We will not give up our historical claims!"
 britain.36.t:0 "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
 britain.36.d:0 "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a novel written by English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells of a young girl named Alice, who fell through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. Alice in Wonderland was published in 1865, three years after Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed in a boat, on 4 July 1862 (this popular date of the "golden afternoon" might be a confusion or even another Alice-tale, for that particular day was cool, cloudy and rainy), up the Isis with the three young daughters of Henry Liddell: Lorina Charlotte Liddell (aged 13, born 1849) ("Prima" in the book's prefatory verse); Alice Pleasance Liddell (aged 10, born 1852) ("Secunda" in the prefatory verse); Edith Mary Liddell (aged 8, born 1853) ("Tertia" in the prefatory verse)."
 britain.36.a:0 "An Excellent Read"
 britain.37.t:0 "The National Society for Women's Suffrage"
 britain.37.d:0 "The National Society for Women's Suffrage was the first national group in the United Kingdom to campaign for women's right to vote. Formed on 6 November 1867, by Lydia Becker, the organisation helped lay the foundations of the women's suffrage movement. Eliza Wigham, Jane Wigham and some of their friends set up an Edinburgh chapter of this National Society. Eliza and her friend Agnes McLaren became the secretaries. The national society was furthered later by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and the Women's Social and Political Union."
 britain.37.a:0 "Close it!"
 britain.37.b:0 "Support it!"
 britain.38.t:0 "Nature's first scientific journal"
 britain.38.d:0 "The enormous progress in science and mathematics during the 19th century was recorded in journals written mostly in German or French, as well as in English. Britain underwent enormous technological and industrial changes and advances particularly in the latter half of the 19th century. In English the most respected scientific journals of this time were refereed journals of the Royal Society, which had published many of the great works from Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday through to early works from Charles Darwin. In addition, during this period, the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s.The publications were designed to serve as "organs of science", in essence, a means of connecting the public to the scientific world."
 britain.38.a:0 "Great to know."
 britain.39.t:0 "England vs Scotland Football match"
 britain.39.d:0 "First detailed description of football was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday. Before the first meeting of the Football Association in The Freemasons' Tavern on Great Queen Street, London on 26 October 1863, there were no universally accepted rules for playing football. Six meetings near London's Covent Garden, at 81-82 Long Acre, ended in a split between the Football Association and what would have become the future rugby ten years later. Both of them had their own uniforms, rituals, gestures and highly formalised rules. Between 1870 and 1872, the Football Association (FA) organised five representative association football matches between teams representing England and Scotland, all held in London. The first of these matches was held at The Oval on 5 March 1870."
 britain.39.a:0 "Scotland won!"

The society was one of several British volunteer medical organisations to serve in the war."

 britain.41.t:0 "A Victory Monument for the Crimean War?"
 britain.41.d:0 "There have been propositions to build a grand victory monument dedicated to the Crimean War in London, but noone is quite sure if we can afford it right now. We need to make a decision."
 britain.41.a:0 "Have it be built!"
 britain.41.b:0 "We can't spend money on this right now."
 britain.42.t:0 "The Hartley Colliery Disaster"
 britain.42.d:0 "A tunnel collapse in a colliery in Hartley has led to a huge disaster as many working men and boys perished within the collapsing tunnels. The disaster has also rendered the colliery unable to run, and we would need to repair the damage in order to use it again. What shall be done?"

 britain.45.t:0 "\"The Salvation Army\""
 britain.45.d:0 "In London's east end, a new movement has been forming for the last couple of days - the \"Salvation Army\". Dedicated to get poor people out of jobs like prostitution and introducing them to Christianity by providing them aid, this institution is modeled after an army - even having its own flags and songs."
 britain.45.a:0 "A good initiative!"
 britain.46.t:0 "The Matterhorn is climbed!"
 britain.46.d:0 "After eight failed attempts, the Matterhorn has finally been climbed for the first time - by an Englishman! Edward Whymper and his party have managed the ascent up the dangerous scaling cliffs - and earned prestige for [ENG.GetNameDef] while doing so."
 britain.46.a:0 "Hooray!"
 britain.47.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef]'s first female doctor"
 britain.47.d:0 "Our countries first female doctor has graduated from university a few days ago. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson is seen by many as a controversial figure, by some as a role model and by some as a travesty. Either way, one more doctor surely can't hurt our nation."
 britain.47.a:0 "Remarkable."
 britain.48.t:0 "Colliery Explosion Disaster in Oaks!"

 britain.51.d:0 "Norman Lockyer, an english astronomer, has just observed a new element, which he gave the name \"Helium\", after the Greek \"Helios\", meaning \"The Sun\". It was observed as a yellow line in the solar spectrum - similar observations had been made by a French astronomer earlier this year, but it led to nothing concrete - until now."
 britain.51.a:0 "We are only just beginning to uncover the scientific realities of our world."
 britain.52.t:0 "The British Empire — 1857"
 britain.52.d:0 "The British Empire was a worldwide system of complex dependencies, colonies, protectorates, and other territories brought under the sovereignty of the crown of Great Britain and the administration of the British government.\n\nAlthough the Empire is at its height of power, many issues still loom over us. Most significantly, the current Sepoy Mutiny is a rebellion that began on May 10th, 1856, in the East India Company's garrisoned town of Meerut, just northeast of Delhi. Many more civilian and army mutiny outbreaks erupted following the one in Meerut, chiefly in the upper Gangetic and central Indian regions. Incidents of revolt were not limited to only central India, as others occurred farther north and east.\n\nThe Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and the summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as skepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. The rebellion and unrest of the populace pose a considerable threat to British power in that region. If our forces are unable to deal with this threat, our position as the globe's greatest power will be questionable—both at home and abroad…\n\nWith the dawn of the industrial revolution, many advancements in technology and changes in society must be made to stay ahead, and an issue that arose from it is major socialist union uprisings and their problems with low wages and unsafe working conditions. Another problem added to tower. Similarly, the status of Ireland has been in question in recent years. With increasing unrest in the region, over time, we will face the issue of how to deal with this situation to ensure a clean and bloodless outcome to Irish resentment.\n\nCaution will become the norm in the coming years ahead. Many decisions will turn the gears of the 20th century, and importantly, Britain's position in it. The tiniest blunder might set off a domino effect, with our great empire toppling along with it."
 britain.52.a:0 "God Save the Queen!"
 britain.53.t:0 "Lord Cupit"
 britain.53.d:0 "Some people called Palmerston a womaniser. The Times named him Lord Cupid (on account of his youthful looks), and he was cited, at the age of 79, as co-respondent in an 1863 divorce case. This skandal could harm our political situation."

 britain.56.d:0 "The 1865 general election was regarded by contemporaries as being a generally dull contest nationally, which exaggerated the degree of corruption within individual constituencies.

 britain.57.t:0 "Marriage of Princess Alice"
 britain.57.d:0 "Queen Victoria had expressed her wish that her children should marry for love, but this did not mean that her choice of suitors would necessarily be extended to anybody outside the royal houses of Europe. The Queen instructed her daughter Victoria, to produce a list of eligible princes in Europe. Her search produced only three suitable candidates: the Prince of Orange; and Prince Albert of Prussia. The Prince of Orange recently journeyed to Windsor Castle so that Queen Victoria could look him over in person, but he proved unpalatable to Alice. The prince too showed little interest in Alice, despite strong pressure from his pro-British mother. Prince Albert, too, was spurned, with Prince Frederick of Prussia remarking that his cousin would not do for "one who deserves the very best". Louis of Hesse was also suggested, a minor German royal. Louis visited Windosr, the Prince and Alice got along together. However, the other two Princes would bring a much more powerful alliance compared to the minor German state. Who should Princess Alice marry? The Prince of Orange or Albert of Prussia for a powerful alliance or the Prince of Hesse for love?"

The Queen has got the help of Princess Victoria who has found two suitable options: Princess Alexandria denmark, Victoria found her a perfect match for the Prince. However, this may cause issues with Prussia due to the rising tentions over Schleswig-Holstein. But could bring a strong alliance. The second possible option is Elizibeth of Wied, the Queen stongly favours Elizibeth but she is not to the Prince's "taste". Who should the Prince of Wales marry? The Princess of Denmark for which will likely end in a happy marriage but could cause issues with Prussia? Or Elizibeth of Wied to ensure we do not cause hotile tention between Britain and Prussia?"
 britain.58.a:0 "Alexandria Princess of Denmark"
 britain.58.b:0 "Elisabeth of Wied"
 britain.59.t:0 "Princess Helena Marriage"
 britain.59.d:0 "Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family. The marriage horrified the Princess of Wales who exclaimed: 'The Duchies belong to Papa.' The Crown Princess of Prussia, who had been a personal friend of Christian's family for many years, ardently supported the proposed alliance. Helena was happy with Christian and was determined to marry him."

William, Prince of Orange, was also considered a suitor, but he had an extravagant lifestyle in Paris, where he lived openly with a lover. Louise viewed marriage to any prince as undesirable, she wished to marry John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, heir to the Dukedom of Argyll. No marriage between a daughter of a monarch and a British subject had been given official recognition since 1515. Who shall the Princess marry? One of the Princess which will cause major upset somewhere or the British subject which would be the first in over 300 years?"

Although they remained side by side, the Queen did not talk to her for seven months, instead communicating by note. Queen Victoria's behaviour, unexpected even by her family, seemed prompted by the threatened loss of her daughter. The Queen regarded Beatrice as her 'Baby'. Subtle persuasions by the Princess of Wales and the Crown Princess of Prussia, who reminded her mother of the happiness that Beatrice had brought the Prince Consort, induced the Queen to resume talking to Beatrice. Queen Victoria consented to the marriage on condition that Henry give up his German commitments and live permanently with Beatrice and the Queen."

As he could lawfully only serve as MP for one constituency, Leeds was passed to his son Herbert.

 britain.183.t:0 "The Expansion of England"
 britain.183.d:0 "Two Courses of Lectures is a book by English historian John Robert Seeley about the growth of the British Empire. Seeley argued that the British expansion was based on its defeat of Louis XIV's France in the 18th century, and that the Dominions were critical to English power. He also stated that holding onto India might not be beneficial to England in the long run. The book was a popular success and received a strongly positive response from British politicians and nobility, and several historians have stated that it had great impact upon British thinking.\n\nSeeley famously remarked that "We seem, as it were, to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind". Seeley noted that it was possible for the Dominions to become independent of Britain, "Such a separation would leave England on the same level as the states nearest to us on the Continent, populous, but less so than Germany and scarcely equal to France. But two states, Russia and the United States, would be on an altogether higher scale of magnitude, Russia having at once, and the United States perhaps before very long, twice our population". However, he also stated that; "The other alternative is that England may prove able to do what the United States does so easily, that is, hold together in a federal union countries very remote from each other. In that case England will take rank with Russia and the United States in the first rank of state, measured by population and area, and in a higher rank that the states of the Continent"."

 britain.184.d:0 "Regimental flags of the British Army were historically described as ‘Colours’ because they displayed the uniform Colours and insignia worn by the soldiers of different units. The name ‘Colour’ continues to be used to this day. The principal role of a regiment’s Colours was to provide a rallying point on the battlefield.\n\nIf troops were to know what their Regiment’s Colours looked like, it was necessary to display them regularly. The way in which this was done was for young officers to march in between the ranks of troops formed up in lines with the Colours held high. This is the origin of the word ‘trooping’. So, what today is a great tradition began life as a vital and practical parade designed to aid unit recognition before a battle commenced.\n\nThe Guards are amongst the oldest regiments of the British Army and have served as the personal bodyguards of The Sovereign since the monarchy was restored after the English Civil War in 1660. The ceremony of Trooping the Colour is believed to have been performed first during the reign of King Charles II. In 1748, it was decided that this parade would be used to mark the official birthday of the Sovereign and it became an annual event after George III became King in 1760.\n\nToday, this colourful spectacular remains a celebration of the Sovereign’s official birthday. Although Her Majesty The Queen’s actual birthday is May 24th, her ‘official birthday’ is marked by the Trooping the Colour ceremony."

Thanks to a robust economy, swelling at the heels from the weight of an Empire, Britain’s population grew incredibly high.

It was long been seen as a milestone in educational development, but recent commentators have stressed that it brought neither free nor compulsory education, and its importance has thus tended to be diminished rather than increased.[The law was drafted by William Forster, a Liberal MP, and it was introduced on 17 February 1870 after campaigning by the National Education League, although not entirely to their requirements. In Birmingham, Joseph Chamberlain, not yet a Member of Parliament, was a prominent campaigner on the issue.

Many a rebellion have had to be put down up to today, and rising republican sentiments among the native Irish have recently been fanned by a major independence movement calling themselves the 'Fenians'. Their message of demanding an Irish nation free from Great Britain has proven very appealing to our Irish subjects.\n\nTheir message of achieving this through violence, however, has proven to be a major headache for our Governor. The sporadic and violent attacks by the Fenian Brotherhood has been a major blow to the stability of the region.

Meaning an Irish legislature will be responsible for domestic affairs, but Britain retained overall legislative supremacy. Similarly, we can establish a Dual Monarchy. Ireland will be equal in status, having freedom of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown.\nThe final option would be to grant Ireland full independence, removing the risk of any further blood-shed.

 britainirishunrest.13.d:0 "Being Celtic and Roman-Catholic, the Irish people are seemingly different from the other people in the United Kingdom. But that did not stop the English from invading Ireland from the 12th Century onwards. With the Norman settlers from England came the English and protestant culture into Ireland, and the old Gaelic Ireland was replaced by the Norman Ireland, which eventually merged together to form a united Irish culture. Until the 16th century, Ireland had great autonomy, which was abolished after the (re-)conquest of the island by the English. Repressed by the British government, the Irish rebelled successfully and got their rights back, like in 1782, when their legislative independence was restored. Even though Great Britain and Ireland were then united into one Kingdom and the Irish Catholics were emancipated by several acts during the 19th Century, the Irish seperatists could not be stopped. Decisions like abolishing the Irish parliament in 1803 or events like the Great Famine during the last 1840s did not help either. In the end the British had to allow Ireland to govern themselves, after violence and unrest spiked during the last months and years. The British think that such a decision may help to calm down the difficult situation Ireland currently has. Why this may be true, it raises the question how Ireland will fare now that their independence was granted by Britain, but also, what consequences Britain will have, how the other people will react to the Irish independence."

Her arrival was unfortunately met with rather thunderous clouds forming overhead, leaving their first day gloomy and muddy across the streets of Dublin. Many gathered around to catch a glimpse of their monarch the next day when the clouds had scattered and the sun beamed from the heavens. The Queen and her consort rode by carriage to St. Stephens Green, where they sat under the marvelously green trees that sprung overhead and the lake ahead, like a sea of emerald glistening in the sunlight, for afternoon tea and crumpets. Their ride to Dundalk is expected to arrive in only a few days, so they plan on spending their remaining time viewing the likes of Trinity College and the GPO Witness History Museum."

 britainirishunrest.19.d:0 "The old stone of Castle Roche once stood as an impregnable fort, surrounded by a deep moat and strong walls. It is built upon a large rocky outcrop and commands extensive views of the surrounding countryside. Now, it is a shadow of its former self, its walls aching from age and the crumbled foundation turning to ruin. A secret passage once connected the castle to a round tower outpost, but it was blocked off by collapsing debris and dirt from the intense storms of centuries past. The Queen took a particular fancy to the old castle after she organized a carriage ride with her husband to see it for the afternoon. Locals said they were there for hours admiring the beauty of the structure. A few days later, they were seen at St. Patrick's Church, spectating a church session before heading off by train to Belfast."

Many loyalists cheered her name in the streets until her subsequent arrival at the home where she would be staying for their visit. The trip there was one of pleasant travel, stopping at many shops and paying for local tokens and trinkets from the blacksmiths and shop owners. Many underweight and malnourished older Irish threw disgruntled glances and spit at her carriage, but the Queen did not seem to take notice. The highlight would be their arrival at the Giant's Causeway, an area of about 40,000 interlocking basalt columns, the result of an ancient volcanic fissure eruption. Legend tells us it was two opposing giants who crafted the place before a duel, and once one was defeated, they fled across the Irish Sea, where they left identical basalt columns. Her Majesty's royal consort seemed pleasantly interested in the tale and location, as he would head down to where the fight was supposed to have taken place. Later, the ride to Londonderry was one of storms and thunder."

The Queen was reported to have spent the whole night reading about the history of the city walls of Londonderry, as that was their first stop the next morning. Londonderry is the only completely intact walled city in Ireland and one of the finest examples of a walled city in Europe. The walls constitute the largest monument in state care in Northern Ireland and, as part of the last walled city to be built in Europe, stand as the most complete and spectacular. It is one of the few cities in Europe that never saw its fortifications breached, withstanding several sieges, including the famous Siege of Derry in 1689, which lasted 105 days, hence the city's nickname, The Maiden City. Like at their earlier stop at Roche Castle, they spent hours marveling over the walls surrounding the city. After stops at local shops and lunch at an exquisite restaurant, they carried on with their journey to Galway."

 britainirishunrest.22.d:0 "The carriage ride from Londonderry to Galway was deemed an excellent adventure by the family as they passed through the likes of the enchanting forest of Benbulben. Galway was no different from Londonderry, save for the rain. Their arrival was met without much excitement, but that was fine for the royal family, as they planned to spend their visit far away, atop a rather secluded home on the Cliffs of Moher. From the cliffs and from atop a tower, visitors can see the Aran Islands in Galway Bay, the Maumturks and Twelve Pins mountain ranges to the north in County Galway, and Loop Head to the south. Because none of the children were permitted to see the ever-expanding overhang of the cliffs from above except from afar, they spent their time at the bottom bemused by the variety of animals that could be seen; grey seals, porpoises, dolphins, minke whales, and basking sharks, as well as, on occasion, sunfish. The Queen and her consort spent most of their time under the shade of trees, dining on local dishes like local cattle and the delicate dish of Irish hare. The train ride to Cork was well spent by the family as they viewed the flat plains of the Irish countryside."

It stretches from Princes Street to the Grand Parade and combines Princes Street Market and the Grand Parade Market. After feeling at home with the comforts of proper English food and items, they headed to the Glenview Gardens. The front garden contains a sunken white garden, an Italianate canal, and a Japanese garden. The boundary wisteria walk opens out into the bog garden and woodland area, from where a tea house enjoys a view of the Mediterranean and tropical gardens. A wander over to the birch mound, which is surrounded by the wildflower meadow, into the walled kitchen garden to view the seasonal vegetables. The gorgeous looks of countless other cultures humbled the family as they took the carriage and headed off back to Dublin for the ferry home."
