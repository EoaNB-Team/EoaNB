#### Flavor Events

###Imperial Japan
japan_flavor.1.t:0 "The Tsukiji Hotel-Japans First Western Hotel "
japan_flavor.1.d:0 "September 1868 saw the end of the Edo era and the beginning of the prosperous Meiji era. The Tsukiji Hotel, Japan's first totally Western-style hotel, was erected in the Tsukiji Teppozu neighborhood of Tokyo during the first year of Meiji. The final Edo Shogunate intended for this hotel to be utilized primarily by foreigners, but plans were altered once the Tokugawa Shogunate fell and the Meiji Restoration rose. The idea began to fall apart early this year, with American architect Richard P. Bridgens drawing the basic concept and renowned Japanese architect Kisuke Shimizu II in charge of the building's functioning design and overall construction.\n \nIt is designed in an eclectic style that incorporates traditional Japanese and Western features. The outside incorporates Japanese-style architectural elements such as namako-style walls, which are more commonly seen around storehouses and samurai households. This, paired with more Westerner-style architectural aspects such as the chimney and weather vane on the roof, as well as the veranda that wraps around the structure, is said to set it apart from others. Kisuke Shimizu went into greater detail, stating that each of the more than 100 bedrooms has a working fireplace and a flushing toilet. Many of the British foreigners expected to stay have praised the hotel, comparing it to the best hotels in Europe.\n \nIt not only has contemporary accommodations but also offers a variety of activities. In addition to providing vital duties as a transportation hub, communication post, and other trade post services, it also has a stagecoach stop and a private post office at its front door. All together, it has gained a renowned view among the locals and is a token of the city."
japan_flavor.1.a:0 "A Fine Establishment"
japan_flavor.2.t:0 "Hebon-shiki Rōmaji"
japan_flavor.2.d:0 "James Curtis Hepburn, an American Presbyterian missionary doctor, released the first Japanese-English dictionary in 1867, titled "A Japanese and English Dictionary; With an English and Japanese Inde which included a novel technique for romanizing Japanese into Latin form. Now in 1872, he introduced his second edition of the book, with only some minor changes from the first. Hepburn remains the dominant romanization style compared to other systems because the system's orthography is based on English phonology rather than a systematic transcription of the Japanese syllabary. Most foreign language students studying in Japan use it, with it commonly used to romanize human names, places, and other information like railway tables and road signs."
japan_flavor.2.a:0 "Another Fair Book, Mr. Hepburn"
japan_flavor.3.t:0 "Osaka Police Department"
japan_flavor.3.d:0 "Mutsuhiro Wantanabe grimaced at the ramshackle building in front of him. "There is no way this is the police department," he muttered to himself. Glancing around, Mutsuhiro observed vendors flanking the entrance, selling pan-fried noodles that made his stomach grumble. Behind him, the dirt streets of Osaka were thronged with people. Turning back to the building, he reluctantly approached a nearby vendor.\n\n"Excuse me, is this the Osaka police department?!" Mutsuhiro screamed over the cacophony enveloping them.\n\n"Yes it is, and you must be the new guy from Tokyo!" The vendor, a small man with snow-white hair, hollered back to Wantanabe.\n\n"How did you know that?" Mutsuhiro inquired.\n\n"Just come with me." The old man removed his apron, revealing a ragged uniform underneath, accompanied by a withered, rusty badge. "My name is Ida. The rest of the department is waiting for you in here."\n\nAs the doors shut behind them, the noise faded away, replaced by a musty smell that did no favors for his sense of smell. Wantanabe expected a crowd, but instead, a mere ten men presided over the entirety of Osaka. He had a multitude of words he wanted to say, among which was the plethora of vulgarity he wished to unleash in his next telegram to Tokyo. Instead, he pulled a cigarette out of his case and lit up. After taking a long drag, Mutsuhiro spoke.\n\n"As you might have heard from the telegram, my name is Mutsuhiro Wantanabe. I am the new Captain of the Osaka Police Department. Two years ago, at the behest of the Emperor, I traveled with a delegation to Europe in order to learn how policing is done in civilized nations. Upon my return, I was assigned to this wonderful city. Actually… I shouldn't say wonderful. I've read the reports; it's a mess. At least three murders every night, Yakuza dogs walk the streets like they own the place, hell, I didn't even feel safe walking here in broad daylight. Yet here we are cooking noodles."\n\nIda raised his hand, "Heichou, we aren't street vendors out of choice. We need the extra revenue-"\n\n"Not anymore, Ida. Emperor Meiji expanded the budget for every prefecture. By next week, we can move out of this dump, get you some proper uniforms, new firearms, and some secretaries to start filing our cases. Most importantly, we'll get enough officers and detectives to make sure no one can escape the long arm of the law. Any questions?"\n\nAnother hand was raised, this time by a gangly man sitting on a splintery chair not made for a man his size. He too was smoking a cigarette.\n\n"Are you Samurai?"\n\nMutsuhiro took a drag. Even though he was dressed in his western garb and smoking western cigarettes, people still pegged him as a Samurai. Would it be this way for the rest of his life? Exhaling smoke from his nose, he responded curtly."
japan_flavor.3.a:0 "I was—a long time ago. Not anymore."
japan_flavor.4.t:0 "A Late Night at the Station"
japan_flavor.4.d:0 "It had been a long day for Ida Kobashigawa. But, at his age, all days were long days. Nevertheless, the elderly man could still walk and see. That was enough for him to keep going. While his coworkers slinked off to brothels or to their wives, Ida didn't have a home life to speak of, and he assumed the new Captain didn't either. Hence, why they reamined to be the only two in the station.\n\n"Another late night, huh Captain?"\n\n"Yep, we're still short-staffed, so I can't take time out of the day to help us settle into the new building. Help me unpack these boxes." Ida sauntered over to Captain Wantanabe and slowly unpacked the freshly stamped imports. Within, he saw shiny pistols, badges, and pristine uniforms.\n\n"So, Ida, what keeps you here so late?" Mutsuhiro inquired. "I have no one waiting for me at home, which leaves me to assume the same for you." Ida responded, lifting the uniforms out of the box.\n\nMutsuhiro sighed, "Sorry to hear that. If it makes you feel better, you were right to assume no one is waiting for me at home. During the tour of Europe and America, I always had my fellow travelers to keep me company, but now I'm on my own."\n\TThe glumness of Mutsuhiro's finishing remarks took Ida off guard. "Woah, way to bring down the mood, Captain."\n\nMutsuhiro, unsure how to respond, continued his unpacking in awkward silence. It was only after the sun went down, and the men were ready to call it a night, that conversation filled the police station again.\n\n"Say, Captain, how about instead of... this-" Ida gestured to the boxes that still needed unpacking, "We get something to eat instead? Pick each other's brains. You said you were a samurai once, correct? I'm quite curious to know more."\n\nWantanabe had turned to leave, but before he stepped out of the station, he turned back to the elderly policeman."
japan_flavor.4.a:0 "That would be nice, Ida. I bid you goodnight."

###Holland
hol_flavor.1.t:0 "The End of Dutch Slavery?"
hol_flavor.1.d:0 "The Dutch government has released an official statement declaring slavery outlawed and abolished within the Kingdom of the Netherlands and her colonies. Being quite controversial in nature, many assume this gesture to be little more than political appeasement rather than a truly abolitionist cause. What is known, however, is that many have earned their rightful freedom today, and hopefully, so too will many more."
hol_flavor.1.a:0 "We may choose to look the other way but we can never say again that we did not know."

###Italy
ita_flavor.1.t:0 "Società Geografica Italiana"
ita_flavor.1.d:0 "Today, a group of young scholars established the “Italian Geographical Society”. In accordance with the provisions of its Statute, the Italian Geographical Society claims to not concern itself solely with applied research. The main goal of its policy, they argue, is the advancement of geographical knowledge ; expanding, updating or innovating knowledge but also fostering geographic culture and environmental awareness, which always seem too limited and yet are absolutely vital. The Society seeks to foster geographic culture in various ways. The first,obvious and traditional, is that of documentation. The second, more daring route, is that of expedition, adventure, and Pioneering."
ita_flavor.1.a:0 "This will further our Intellectual Prestige!"
ita_flavor.2.t:0 "A New Grand Galleria?"
ita_flavor.2.d:0 "Architect Giuseppe Mengoni's 1861 ambitious designs for a new super Galleria in the center of Milan square are prepared to be set into motion. In Honour of his majesty, King Vittorio Emanuele II and his victory in the Risorgimento, the new luxurious Galleria will attract bourgeoisie from around the world. For sheer belle époque splendor, this extravagant 19th-century glass-topped, barrel-vaulted network of golden-gilded tunnel's is to serve as a lively shopping metropolis.The exquisite design invites visitors and residents to basque in it’s architectural splendors as they browse through the shopping alley’s or stop to take a quick bite in its plentiful variety of cafes and ristoranti. The mere elegance and architectural beauty of the Galleria is sure to give Italy a place among the minds of those who love a life of grandeur and comfort"

###England
england_flavor.1.t:0 "Opening of the London Underground"
england_flavor.1.d:0 "After roughly 9 years of planning and development, the world's first underground railway has finally been completed and opened for trial in London. The Metropolitan Railway conducted a trial run today, carrying approximately 38,000 passengers between Paddington and Farringdon. The trial succeeded, so much so that the company has already begun planning and development of its next sections within London."

The rules will be developed over a series of meetings in a short time, in various meetings with the clubs' representatives. The first president elected is Arthur Pember, captain of the N.N. Football Club. The first secretary appointed is E.C. Morley, the captain of the Barnes Football Club and a fierce supporter of the governing body."

###France
france_flavor.1.t:0 "Public Outrage Over a Painting"
france_flavor.1.d:0 "The public in and around the Salon des Refusés has begun outcries and scandals over a recent addition by French painter Édouard Manet. His work, Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass) depicts two scarcely clothed women, one having a picnic with two fully dressed men.

Under the command of William Lewis Herndon, a veteran of the Mexican-American War, left port at Colón, New Granada, heading towards New York City carrying 30,000 pounds (14,000 kg) of gold, only making one stop at Havana, Cuba. Nature works in sick and twisted ways though because as the ship was travelling along the coast of the Carolinas, they were caught in a hurricane! For two days they struggled with the storm until the ship couldn’t take it anymore. The crew spent the entire night trying to save the ship but it was to no avail. Luckily, the next morning two ships were spotted. The brig Marine was the first ship that lent aid, saving 153 passengers, mainly women and children, however they couldn’t continue as the ship sank and the harsh winds made the task more difficult. The other ship, a bark named Ellen, saved an additional fifty from the waters. It is reported that about 425 people, including the captain, were killed in the sinking and the gold was also lost in the event."

 usa_flavor.4.d:0 "News reached the capitol today that Thomas Jefferson Rusk, the President pro tempore of the United States Senate, has committed suicide. Rusk had a very long political history starting with the Republic of Texas where he served as the first Secretary of War and also as a general in the Batlle of San Jacinto. His service to Texas did not end there; he also held positions in the Texan senate and even as Cheif Justice of their Supreme Court as well as a variety of military positions. Rusk fought for annexation of Texas into the United States and was elected as a senator representing Texas before his election to be President pro tempore. The death of his wife and a recent illness are what reports are claiming as the cause for his suicide."

 usa_flavor.5.t:0 "Suicide of Anson Jones"
 usa_flavor.5.d:0 "News reached the capitol today that Anson Jones, the last President of the Republic of Texas, has committed suicide. Jones became very bitter after his term as President ended as he expected to be elected to the US Senate to represent Texas, but was defeated by his former political allies. Despite becoming very wealthy from planting he could never get over his continued failed attempts at representing his state, which many report is the reason for his suicide. His death comes only months after the suicide of Thomas Jefferson Rusk- another important figure in Texan politics."

 usa_flavor.6.t:0 "Flying Eagle cent released for circulation"
 usa_flavor.6.d:0 "Out with the large cent, in with the Flying Eagle. The large cent was becoming increasingly unpopular and getting too expensive to coin, therefore the US Mint has decided to replace the coin with a smaller coin made up of a composition of 88% copper and 12% nickel. The  coin is nicknamed “Flying Eagle” due to the depiction of an eagle on the front of the coin, designed by James B. Longacre who took inspiration from his predecessor, Christian Gobrecht. This will also replace the Spanish Colonel Real that has been in use up until this point."
 usa_flavor.6.a:0 "Here's to a better economy!"
 usa_flavor.7.t:0 "Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company closes New York banks"
 usa_flavor.7.d:0 "The Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company, founded in 1830, has now ceased operations in its New York City office. The company made investments in agriculture-related business, mostly to export to European countries due to their focus on military investment because of the Crimean War raging on. After the war was concluded, these European countries went back to producing crops and had no use of American imports. This led to the value of American foodstuffs decreasing. This, alongside rumors of embezzlement by employees and officers of the company, led to their offices in New York City closing."

 usa_flavor.8.t:0 "New York Banks stop gold withdrawals"
 usa_flavor.8.d:0 "Terrible news comes to the capitol today from New York City!

New York, along with the rest of the country’s banks, have done this act, although much later than Philadelphia which stopped on September 26th. We feel this economic event will be felt throughout the world, as many country’s economies have gone international and intertwined with one another."

 news_flavor.4.d:0 "Earlier today, a lecture held by Physicist and Fellow of the Royal Society John Tyndall revealed several worrying and concerning properties of Coal Gas and Ether to be strongly absorptive of the sun's heat. In his lecture, Tyndall explained that \"when the heat is absorbed by the planet, it is so changed in quality that the rays emanating from the planet cannot get with the same freedom back into space. Thus the atmosphere admits of the entrance of solar heat; but checks its exit, and the result is a tendency to accumulate heat at the surface of the planet.\""

 news_flavor.5.t:0 "Hidden in Plain Sight!"
 news_flavor.5.d:0 "At the Paris Observatory in France this evening, renowned french astronomer Urbain Le Verrier announced the potential discovery of a new inter-mercurial object in the sky. The sighting of the planet was first recorded by french village doctor, turned astronomer hobbyist Edmond Modeste Lescarbault just months prior from his aged clinic. If these findings are to be verified, 'Vulcan' as some of fellow astronomers are calling, will be the second planet to not be discovered by sighting, but whose existence was predicted by Le Verrier's solar-gravitational models (Discrepencies between the motion of Uranus and the model had led to the discovery of Neptune a decade ago in 1854.) and will further professionialize the use of mathematical models to make discoveries in the celestial sky.\n \nWhile Le Verrier has been a proven standard of astrophysics in the last decade, many other astronomers are now describing this new discovery as proposterous at worse and faulty as best. An inter-mercurial object would have been discovered centuries if not millennia earlier, as any sizable object in this close proximity of the sun would have been recorded much sooner than now."

The escalation started June 15th this year on the disputed San Juan Islands between Vancouver Island and the state of Washington when a US citizen shot a pig on his land that belonged to his Irish neighbour, who worked for the British Hudson's Bay Company. It is reported that British authorities threatened to arrest the US citizen if he didn't pay the demanded compensation for the shot pig which caused other American settlers to demand military protection. When the commanding officer in the neighbouring Department of Oregon, U.S.A. dispatched soldiers to the San Juan Islands the British promptly replied by sending their own, which in turn prompted the Americans to send even more soldiers. By August 10th the situation had escalated so far that 461 US soldiers with 14 guns were facing of against 2140 British soldiers with five warships mounting 70 guns. Thankfully cooler heads in Washington D.C. and London, upon receiving news about the volatile situation have managed to negotiate an agreement allowing both sides to keep 100 soldiers each on the islands while the border dispute will be resolved by international arbitration. Let's hope it peace prevails."

Mount Elbrus, situated in the western portion of the Caucasian Mountains, is the tallest and most prominent summit in all of Russia and Europe. The mountain has had many travelers throughout history, but only recently have routine climbing expeditions started to reach the peak. On July 22nd, 1829, the first major climb took place when Khillar Khachirov, a guide for an Imperial Russian army scientific expedition commanded by General Georgi Emmanuel, scaled the lower, eastern one of the two peaks for the first time. An English expedition headed by F. Crauford Grove, a well-known mountain climber in the Swiss Alps, was recently successful in reaching the highest summit, the western peak, where they were joined by Frederick Gardner, a well-established mountaineer from England, Horace Walker, and Swiss guide Peter Knubel."

 asiageneraldiplomatic.15.t:0 "Portugal bans the Macau Slave Trade"

 asiageneraldiplomatic.16.t:0 "Portugal dismisses our request"

Such an organizational structure requires a certain development environment, which in our case is GitHub. Thanks to GitHub, every dev is able to work on the mod semi-independently. However, having the mod on GitHub with that many devs working on it automatically means that it is virtually impossible for us to regularly update the Steam version on the workshop. Consequently, the Steam version is only updated when major updates come out, being the reason for why EoaNB is perceived as \"idle\" or \"dead\" by many when only looking at the workshop page. Still, what has already been explained on the official workshop page is often overlooked.\n\nIf you want to experience an up-to-date End of a New Beginning, the first step would be to join our official Discord (linked on the workshop). After that, you can look up how to install the GitHub version in our #faq channel. Generally seen, the GitHub version of EoaNB is way more developed and advanced than the Steam one. Do remember, however, that the mod on GitHub is an in-development version, prone to changes, bugs and balance issues."

 aus.9.d:0 "It is now the year 1857, and although nine years have passed since the Revolutions of 1848, the legacy of the uprisings still scar the empire. Discontent continues in the regions outside of Austria proper, causing many advisors to believe that the central government may be forced to give concessions to the provincial governments in order to prevent a repeat of 1848. With our former ally, Russia, no longer supporting us, it is of the utmost importance that the sentiment of revolution does not stir again, as the empire came close to collapse the last time it did. Oh, Kaiser Franz Josef! Lead the Austrian Empire to glory, unite its people, and bring justice to its enemies!"

 aus.10.d:0 "The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia and its inhabitants have brought the Austrian Empire nothing but trouble since 1848. The "Risorgimento" movement for Italian unification has been the worst of our worries regarding the Italian region. For centuries, the Italian peninsula has been split between many kingdoms and has been dominated by foreign powers, such as France or Austria. A unified Italian Kingdom would pose a large threat to current Austrian holdings in Northern Italy. Such a kingdom would also be a large threat to the continuation of the Austrian Empire, as it is highly unlikely that they will be willing to ally us. Therefore, we must do anything in our power to keep resistance to a minimum and to keep a unified Italy from coming to fruition."
 aus.10.a:0 "We must stand firm."

The “northern provinces” are at serious risk of seeing themselves “again” in a situation of barbarism, as they are almost exclusively inhabited by Indians. In order to solve this chronic problem of lack of manpower, it is necessary to transfer African-American workers, who are more adaptable to the soil and tropical climate. These free and paid African-American workers will be responsible for developing the region's resources and infrastructure, they will be under a two to five year employment contract, during which time they must pay the costs of their transportation. After the end of this contract, the worker will receive Brazilian citizenship and a piece of land, thus guaranteeing his interest in staying and developing the region.

After these settlers' discontent with the local administration, the US openly supported the secession of this region by placing it under its influence zone and subsequently annexing the territory. Although intervention in South America is less likely, it is not impossible to carry out, linked to old documents about Destiny Manifesto, dated 1850, in which Matthew Fontaine Maury, head of the Naval Observatory, proposes a plan for the occupation of the Amazon starting with the settlement of American slaves to "develop" the resources of the region and later taking it by force.

Economically, it is the most important river in South America, as access to many territories in these countries is possible thanks to navigation in the La Plata Basin and its tributaries. And it is through this that products are imported or exported in the region. Therefore, the control of the Rio de la Plata basin is vital for the interests of all the countries that bathe in it. Whoever dominates the River Plate, dominates the trade, navigation and transport of the entire region. Sometimes these interests overlap, leading to hostilities between countries in the region, which can even escalate into war."
 brazil.foreign.news.7.d1:0 "After the recognition and legitimation of the claims of Brazilian Lords and the application of pressure to the Uruguay Government, the situation at the border between the two noises became tense. Often strongly armed Brazilians escorted cattle in search of pasture, crossing the Uruguayan border. In one of these escorts, Uruguayan officers who patrolled the border in the province artigas, saw the Brazilians armed, fearing the beginning of an invasion, the Uruguayans approached the Brazilian escort. It is not known who gave the first shot but this battle can begin a new armed conflict in the Rio de la Plata Basin."

 brazil.amazon_colonization.1.d:0 "The first batch of African-American immigrants arrives at Brazilian ports. Such a thing can only happen thanks to the joint action of the Empire of Brazil and the USA. The scarce labor force in the northern region of Brazil will finally be supplied and the United States can ease some of the racial tension. Received with open arms by the Empire of Brazil to develop the Amazon Basin region, African-American immigrants will find a challenging land, but full of new opportunities, something that would not be possible in the USA."
 brazil.amazon_colonization.d_USA:0 "About a month ago, ships with thousands of African Americans sailed from the USA to Brazil in search of a better life. This was only possible due to our diplomatic efforts to reach an agreement with Brazil, in which both sides were satisfied.

On 10 September, he took a one-day excursion to Collingwood, before returning to Toronto the following day. On his way back, he visited and received addresses from Aurora, Barrie, Bradford, and Newmarket. In Toronto, the Prince attended the Royal Canadian Yacht Club's regatta, agreeing to become its patron; and opened Allan Gardens, and Queen's Park to the public. He departed the city for London, Ontario on 12 September, visiting Guelph and Stratford on the way. From London, he travelled to Sarnia, in order to attend a gathering of 150 First Nations representatives in the Province of Canada. Following this gathering, he briefly returned to London, before travelling by railway to the Niagara Peninsula. In the peninsula, he visited Brantford, Chippewa, Fort Erie, and Queenston. The Niagara Falls were illuminated for the first time during his tour of the falls.There, he rode on the Maid of the Mist. At Queenston, he met with 160 War of 1812 veterans, dedicated a rebuilt Brock's Monument, and visited Laura Secord. From Queenston, he moved towards Niagara-on-the-Lake, St. Catherines, and Hamilton."

Taking a month-long personal tour of the United States, he travelled under the pseudonym "Lord Renfrew," in an attempt to not attract attention to himself. The Canadian co-premieres saw-off the Prince's during his departure from Canada, and again from the United States, travelling to Portland, Maine on 20 October 1860 to see the Prince off."

 tsushima.2.a:0 "How nice of them."
 tsushima.3.t:0 "Japan calls for our aid!"
 tsushima.3.d:0 "The island of Tsushima is a small, but militarily and strategically interesting island in the East China Sea/Sea of Japan. It has come into the spotlight recently when a Russian ship landed on its shores, with the intent to seize ownership of the island so that a Russian Naval Base may be constructed there. The Japanese have objected, and have called us to back them up in this conflict. How will we respond?"

 tsushima.6.d:0 "The Russians have drafted a treaty to resolve the recent crisis over Tsushima - in their favour, of course. The treaty states that they are to receive rights to the coastline of the island (effectively giving them control over it), with the right to build naval bases and dock ships fully included. Our government can say what it will, but the Tsushima local authorities ultimately have the final say. Let us see how they decided."

 tsushima.8.t:0 "The Tsushima Authorities refused!"
 tsushima.8.d:0 "The local authorities of Tsushima have refused the Coastline Charter, stating that they will not allow Russian influence on this island, especially by \"illegitimate means\" and after the recent clashes on the island. What is our response to this?"

 tsushima.9.d:0 "[RUS.GetNameDef] has backed down in the Tsushima Crisis, resolving the situation and restoring peace to the island, whose citizens were already growing more and more anxious with every day of Russian presence.

 tsushima.9.a:0 "Conflict avoided."
 tsushima.10.t:0 "The Russians refuse to back down!"
 tsushima.10.d:0 "[RUS.GetNameDef] seems to have really set their eye on Tsushima, because they refused to back down even when the local authorities gave them a clear no. Maybe we should just give them the island - or maybe the threat of war will contain their imperialist desires."

 tsushima.14.d:0 "Part of the peace treaty signed over the Tsushima War included a section stating that [JAP.GetNameDef] is to open their ports to [ENG.GetNameDef], but many isolationists in our country oppose this. Should we try to break the treaty, or go along with it?"

 baltic.1.t:0 "The Lithuanian National Revival"
 baltic.1.d:0 "The Political Union of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland once created the largest and greatest European Superpower, the terror of the Ottoman and humbler of the Rus. But centuries of German and Russian imperialism and political meddling has erased the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth from the maps of Europe. But recent years has seen more and more Lithuanian Liberal Intellectuals seek political self-determination. Already they are reviving the common Lithuanian language, rehabilitating it for modern use. This kind of nationalism can only end one way."
