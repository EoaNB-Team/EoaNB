Italy cannot be truly reunified unless steps are taken to ensure freedom from the meddling Austrians. Luckily, Napoleon III of France shares with us a common enemy. We should send Count Cavour to meet with him, but none must know of this. We will disguise the trip as a mere vacation to Switzerland while Count Cavour will travel on to Plombieres, where the French Emperor has agreed to meet with us. Together, the two leaders will plan an invasion of the Austrian-controlled part of our beautiful peninsula, and drive out foreign influence.

##Tuscan Focus Tree
TUS_the_tuscan_economy: "The Tuscan Economy"
TUS_the_tuscan_economy_desc: " If we are to become more than just a state to be dictated by foreign powers, we must develop an economy. Turning our focus here will benefit all of Tuscany."
TUS_the_sharecropping_debates: "The Sharecropping Debate"
TUS_the_sharecropping_debates_desc: "Due to our agrarian economy, it is obvious that sharecropping should be considered, seeing it’s success in the American south with its cotton industry. While a larger harvest would benefit us, this may upset the people as it will most definitely bring more of the poor into debt with landlords. This must be decided before we go any further with agriculture. "
TUS_textile_industry: "The Textile Industry"
TUS_textile_industry_desc: "The textile industry is something that many have made profits off of, especially in England. We would be foolish to not take advantage of its growth to further boost our economic ambitions."
TUS_the_artisans: "The Artisans"
TUS_the_artisans_desc: "Like much of the Italian peninsula, our economy is dominated by artisan-based industry. With our economy on the way to growing, it is pivotal that we make use of the artisans within our country. Their skill would be much needed in our workforce, and it will help increase our profits from exports with their talents utilized."
TUS_ridolfis_experiment: "Ridolfi's Experiment"
TUS_ridolfis_experiment_desc: "Ridolfi is a man that could bring the reform that Tuscany needs. If wages inspire our workers to work harder, perhaps it would be worth trying this. Productivity is what will keep us thriving, especially with our agrarian economy. However, a significant conflict has erupted between Ridolfi’s supporters and his critics. This may be too expensive, which might mean losing more money than we need to. This must be settled as we work on our agricultural sector."
TUS_reform_elsewhere: "Reform Elsewhere"
TUS_reform_elsewhere_desc: "Despite the promising aspects of Ridolfi's experimentation in the Agricultural sectors, our ministers have never been fond of changes the Tuscan economic outlook. We must look for a different solution, the workers are not the tools we need, though it is becoming clear that the estates might be the ones receiving more power, which will make us more popular with the upper class, the ones with actual power."
TUS_land_reclamation: "Maremma Reclaimations"
TUS_land_reclamation_desc: " Innovation is what we need and with our agrarian economy, it is a doctrine we must utilize to maintain our economy. Making artificial land would give us more land to farm and more land for the estates to control, which can kickstart our agricultural sector above the rest of Italy."
TUS_power_to_the_estates: "Power to the Estates"
TUS_power_to_the_estates_desc: "The estates are what makes us profits, workers may be important but with no estates, there would be no farms for us to profit off of. We must give the necessary power to the estates that allows them to work as efficiently as possible, which would only bring more into our pockets."
TUS_introduce_wage_labour: "Introduce Wage Labor"
TUS_introduce_wage_labour_desc: "According to Ridolfi’s plans, we will introduce wages for workers which will increase our worker’s productivity for a small cost. This will also reduce tensions when it comes to sharecropping, a small price to pay for the stability of our nation."
TUS_curtail_innovation: "Curtail Innovation"
TUS_curtail_innovation_desc: "Why fix what works? Making artificial land does not help us, the productivity of our workers does! The work they do, which has increased due to the wages we have given them, is enough for us to move forward. We must stomp out outrageous ideas of innovation, and stick to what works."
TUS_power_to_the_workers: "Power to the Workers"
TUS_power_to_the_workers_desc: "With the new reforms we have made, worker productivity is at its absolute height! Fields are being worked with a national drive and with much needed stability being brought within our lower-class populace. By giving power to the workers, we are getting more profits along with a more stable agricultural society."
TUS_continue_with_free_trade: "Continue with Free Trade"
TUS_continue_with_free_trade_desc: "The Grand Duke and his government have long been proponents of Free Trade. Exports are something we must utilize if we want to be a shining star in Italian economics. With artisan talents and a workforce with growing skill, we have the methods to create economic interests for other nations to invest in. Not only will our economy grow, but we will gain much needed trade relations as well."
TUS_protect_tuscan_production: "Protect Tuscan Production"
TUS_protect_tuscan_production_desc: "We must keep a firm hold on our products, our resources, and our economic independence. Depending on foreign trade could put us in an economic disaster and trade relations can threaten our isolation. We must stop the excessive exports, so we can put our own resources to our own use, which will be far more reliant than exports."
TUS_consumers_exist_not_in_the_countryside: "Consumers Exist not in the Countryside"
TUS_consumers_exist_not_in_the_countryside_desc: "If we are to make a real profit, we must accept the fact that our economy does not depend on our internal powers but more so from foreign buyers, regardless of our plans on trade, it is important that we maintain some level of trade."
TUS_but_outside_the_countryside: "But Outside the Country"
TUS_but_outside_the_countryside_desc: "In the words of a Livorian banker, the Tuscan market is too small compared to what it could be. We must put efforts towards expanding the market if we are to reach our economic peak. We must expand our reach through trade, which will help our economy run along smoothly."
TUS_the_expanding_grain_market: "The Expanding Grain Market"
TUS_the_expanding_grain_market_desc: "Grain has become a valued and more necessary resource that provides an opportunity for us to take advantage of. With increased harvests and our agricultural sector being expanded and improved upon, we can export grain to foreign powers with a guaranteed profit."
TUS_the_iron_industry: "The Iron Industry"
TUS_the_iron_industry_desc: " Iron is a resource that is growing in value which we have. We must dig deep and greedily, as with technology moving forward that utilizes iron, it will be important for us to be a step ahead, which benefits both sides of our trading policies. "
TUS_learn_from_leghorn: "Learn from Leghorn"
TUS_learn_from_leghorn_desc: "If Tuscany is to prosper, then we must learn from the ways of Livorno. The profits that were made from a free port city is something that we Tuscans should take advantage of, and it can benefit our intentions to increase the Tuscan market’s reach to Europeans. Just in the way of Livorno, we shall make our port cities hubs for trading profit."
TUS_modernisation: "Modernization"
TUS_modernisation_desc: "As we push economically, it is vital that we recognize the need for modernization, we must study foreign techniques, to replace our outdated techniques and equipment. This is needed so we can push Tuscany’s capabilities to their limit. "
TUS_not_industrialisation: "Railway Developments"
TUS_not_industrialisation_desc: "The Grand Duke of Tuscany long supported the development of rail in Tuscany. Railways could even be found in Lucca prior to its annexation into Tuscany. Multiple politicians and companies support the expansion of rail networks all around Tuscany to help support the economy."

TUS_the_political_scene: "The Political Scene"
TUS_the_political_scene_desc: "The Politics of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany are not what they used to be. Power is held almost entirely by the Duke and the nobility. After Austria forced the removal of the constitution, liberal elements of society were pushed underground. However, these movements are still strong and may rise to challenge the Duke or call on him to remember his past support of liberalism."
TUS_memories_of_the_past: "Memories of the Past"
TUS_memories_of_the_past_desc: "The Revolutions of 1848 were a great period in Tuscany. The Grand Duke supported Sardinia's war against Austria and a constitution was enacted.

TUS_de_moderate_liberalism: "Moderate Liberalism"
TUS_de_moderate_liberalism_desc: "Liberalism is not an unfamiliar concept to the Tuscan people. The Grand Duke himself supported liberal elements of the revolutions of 1848.

TUS_into_radicalism: "Towards Radicalism"

TUS_into_republicanism: "Towards Republicanism"
TUS_into_republicanism_desc: "If we are to liberalize Tuscany it must be done with the support of the Grand Duke. The people still have some admiration for the Grand Duke despite the authority he rules with. With Leopold II leading a more liberal Tuscany we will be better situated to challenge Austrian influence and ensure our government's strength."

# Tuscan Events
tuscany.1.t: "The Grand Duchy of Tuscany"
tuscany.1.d: "The Grand Duchy of Tuscany has long been ruled by the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, interrupted only during Napoleon's conquest of Italy. During the revolutions of 1848 the Grand Duke Leopold II embraced liberalism and our soldiers fought side by side with those from Sardinia, The Papal States, and the Kingdom of Naples. Overthrown by popular revolt still, Leopold could only return to rule Tuscany with the assistance of Austria, whose garrison only left in 1855. With the liberal constitution revoked the politics of the Duchy are stagnant. An incompetent ruling class rules over the land of Tuscany. As Sardinia-Piedmont is beginning to suggest Italian Unity our people become restless. Will the traditions of our Duchy lead us to dust, or will we embrace the republican spirit of our people?"
tuscany.1.a: "It is a trying time"
tuscany.2.t: "The Tuscan Economy"
tuscany.2.d: "The Tuscan Economy is almost entirely agrarian. The largest export from our nation is grain. Despite the agrarian occupation that many of our citizens hold, there is a growing artisan industry as the need for manufacturing increases. Rails in the Duchy are in the midst of an upgrade as work with the Austrian rail companies assists the connections we make between our capital and the port city of Livorno. Livorno is the home of trade and industry for Tuscany. Textiles and Iron flow from the port as the base for our economy. However, a battle is brewing between land owners and peasants, and bosses and workers."
tuscany.2.a: "More Problems to Solve"
tuscany.3.t: "The Sharecropping Debate"
tuscany.3.d: "Feudalism has never really left Tuscany. The Sharecroppers, mezzadros, has a compact with the landowner to cultivate land and share profits from sales in return for housing, seeds, and other minor goods. The merits of this system are being called into question by our politicians, especially the liberal ones. More and more farmers are demanding the rights to own their own land."
tuscany.3.a: "The future of mezzadria is in question"
tuscany.4.t: "The Ridolfi Experiment"
tuscany.4.d: "Cosimo Ridofli operates a fine winery in Tuscany. As the issues with sharecropping influence many land owners, Ridolfi has proposed possibly introducing wage labor on a wider scale in Tuscany. Wage labor is something usually reserved to those who work with the artisans or other part of the economy. There is disagreement if introducing wage labor to agriculture could solve our issues or make them worse."
tuscany.4.a: "We must introduce wage labor"
tuscany.4.b: "Our reforms must be elsewhere"
tuscany.5.t: "The Political Scene"
tuscany.5.d: "Leopold II is not a very popular leader. His dynasty is propped up by Austria and their empire influences our nation a great deal. One condition of his return was the removal of the constitution, something the liberal politicians seek to have returned. There are minor legislative powers in the government but much power is centralized. As rumors that Sardinia-Piedmont will make its attempt to unify Italy soon are spreading, so is discontent and shadow organizations."
tuscany.5.a: "The future is unknown"
tuscany.6.t: "Memories of 1848"
tuscany.6.d: "Following the revolutions of 1848 the Grand Duchy of Tuscany joined the Sardinian coalition in the fight against Austria. Our troops eventually pulled out along with those of the Two Sicilies and Papal States, and our people revolted against Duke Leopold II. The Austrian Empire eventually put down the revolt and reinstated Leopold, at the cost of removing the constitution granted after the revolutions. The people do not have fond memories of the events that unfolded."
tuscany.6.a: "An unfortunate legacy"
tuscany.7.t: "Liberalism in Tuscany"
tuscany.7.d: "Though not present today, Tuscany has a long history of liberal elements. It was the original Senate of the Forty-Eight that eventually allowed the Medici family to create the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In Tuscany today liberalism is all but criminalized. Liberal politicians work in secret organizations away from the public eye. With Austrian influence in the nation, many wonder if a radical approach is necessary just as it was in 1848. There are a wealth of secret radical societies and exiled politicians that would be ready to assist a new uprising. On the other hand, if Leopold II came out in support of a constitutional monarchy, it could diminish the chance that Austria attempts to interfere in our nation's politics again."
tuscany.7.a: "Radicalism is our only hope"
tuscany.7.b: "Republicanism is our only chance"
tuscany.8.t: "Tuscan National Society"
tuscany.8.d: "Italian National Societies exist across the peninsula. Most prominent are the societies in Piedmont and Lombardy. Originally founded by the supporters of Mazzini, these societies support the unification of Italy through a variety of means. In Tuscany the national societies have been forced underground. Allowing these societies to return to a more public scene will further support for liberalizing Tuscany."
tuscany.8.a: "The time for change has come"
tuscany.9.t: "An End to the Sharecropping Debate?"
tuscany.9.d: "Drastic changes is the political climate of the nation have reignited debates over the economy of Tuscany. Though the estates and nobles have lost much of their power, sharecropping is not a system that will be removed from Tuscany quickly. Many question if it is time for our nation to finally adopt the Industrial Revolution completely. At the same time, the rest of Europe is removing their farmland and replacing it with factories. Demands for Tuscan grain are higher than ever and clearing land for factories will hamper our ability to meet the needs of nations looking to import our grain. However, a choice must be made."
tuscany.9.a: "Embrace the Industrial Revolution"
tuscany.9.b: "We must ride out our agrarian roots longer"
tuscany.10.t: "The Path to Perugia"
tuscany.10.d: "There has long been plans to expand our rail lines into Perugia. These plans have been proposed from various politicians and companies. Grand Duke Leopold II originally desired to have the line pass through Siena, extending the Florence-Siena line. Bettino Ricaosoli and many other favored extending the Arezzo line. With the completion of both the Siena and Arezzo lines, a decision must be made regarding the path to Perugia."
tuscany.10.a: "The Siena Line"
tuscany.10.b: "The Arezzo Line"
tuscany.11.t: "The Constitutional Monarchy"
tuscany.11.d: "It is no secret that Leopold II harbors some support for the liberal movements within Italy. In a bold move against the Austrian Empire Leopold II has allowed the transition towards a Constitutional Monarchy to begin. Giovanni Baldasseroni, prime minister under Leopold II, has been given a temporary increase in power as the office of the Prime Minister will take over as head of government. Leopold II will remain as head of state and though his political power is certainly weakened, his dynasty has secured a place in Tuscan politics."
tuscany.11.a: "This was a necessary step to take"
tuscany.12.t: "Return of the Constitution"
tuscany.12.d: "It has been a long time now that Tuscany has lacked a proper constitution. After the first constitution was forcibly removed by the Austrian Empire many doubted that such a thing could return to Tuscany. Against all odds, however, our people have triumphed and the Constitution has returned. This time around, Austria will not be able to force her will on us."
tuscany.12.a: "The Freedom of Italians must be protected!"
tuscany.13.t: "Favoring a Party"
tuscany.13.d: "With the Grand Duke's position in the government of Tuscany solidified, the influence of his dynasty cannot be ignored. The first elections for the Prime Minister of Tuscany will occur soon and the victor will not win without the influence of Leopold II."
tuscany.13.a: "Support the Republicans, keep our \"enemies\" close"
tuscany.13.b: "The Conservatives are more in line with our views"
tuscany.14.t: "Elections of 1859"
tuscany.14.d: "Today will go down as one of the most important days in Italian history. Record numbers of people have come out to vote for the prime minister of Tuscany. Grand Duke Leopold II has proceeded over the elections and is preparing to announce the victor. It is no secret that he may have influenced the outcome but it has not taken away from the joy of the people."
tuscany.14.a: "Conservative Ubaldino Peruzzi, last of the Medici's"
tuscany.14.b: "Republican Carlo Cattaneo, former member of the Council of Milan"
tuscany.15.t: "Italian Revolutionaries in Parma and Modena"
tuscany.15.d: "The Duchies of Parma and Modena were forced into the Austro-Sardinian war for the same connections to Austria that once held our nation down. Just like our people refused to fight in favor of Austria, the people of Parma and Modena have formed revolutionary councils with temporary power granted to liberal politicians. These regions are now prepared to join with any cause hoping to unite Italy."
tuscany.15.a: "Convince their leaders to join us"
tuscany.15.b: "Fellow Italians United!"
tuscany.16.t: "Diplomacy with Sardinia-Piedmont"
tuscany.16.d: "With our ambitions to unify the peninsula known, the time has come to open diplomacy with Sardinia-Piedmont. Many in our government hope that an agreement can be reached that will avoid conflict. Sardinia-Piedmont employs an army that may be difficult to defeat, despite the large number of Italians who now support our efforts. If an agreement is to be reached, it will surely be costly."
tuscany.16.a: "[TUS.GetLeader] must meet with [PIE.GetLeader]"
tuscany.16.b: "It is too late for diplomacy"
tuscany.17.t: "Tuscany seeks Diplomacy"
tuscany.17.d: "[TUS.GetLeader] is meeting with [PIE.GetLeader] today to discuss the possibility of unifying our governments. Though an extreme measure, both of our governments have expressed desire to see the Italian Peninsula unified. Unfortunate for our position is the fact that Tuscany has embraced a much more liberalized government and outlook than we employ. The people of Italy have become split and fear of revolutionaries joining Tuscany have become very real. The best offer we can accept is to guarantee that our politicians have solidified positions in the new government."
tuscany.17.a: "We have no choice, secure a position for our politicians"
tuscany.17.b: "We came this far, war it will have to be"
tuscany.18.t: "The Costly Agreement"
tuscany.18.d: "Coming as somewhat of a surprise the government of Sardinia-Piedmont has agreed to unite our governments, requiring only that politicians from Turin are given special positions. While the agreement will tarnish our reputation and introduce possible corruption into our government, it is a great leap into building the legitimacy of our nation and claims."
tuscany.18.a: "Unification is Near"
tuscany.19.t: "Hostilities Break Out!"
tuscany.19.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont was unwilling to attempt to unify our governments, even at the suggestion of placing their politicians in key positions. With no agreement in sight, it did not take long for a state of war to be declared. Sardinia-Piedmont claims that our government is illegitimate and violates agreements made following the Second Independence war, while our claim rests upon our representation of all Italians and the greater liberal unification movement."
tuscany.19.a: "War is Among Us"
tuscany.20.t: "Garibaldi Joins our Cause"
tuscany.20.d: "Giuseppe Garibaldi, hero of the Italian People, has arrived to pledge his support for our movement. All too aware of the elitist present in Turin, Gariabldi was eager to join our attempts to create a truly liberalized Italy. The presence of Garibaldi has increased moral among the people greatly and has given us much legitimacy in the eyes of Italians."
tuscany.20.a: "Our Victory is certainly Secured!"
tuscany.21.t: "Supporting Democracy in Tuscany"
tuscany.21.d: "As our influence in the Central States continues to grow, the question has arisen as to how much support we should dedicate to Tuscan democracy. The people of Tuscany are very supportive of liberalization but many radicals persist to challenge our ideal for unification. Some fear that should we strengthen Tuscan democracy too much, their own radical movement may rise to challenge our hopes for unification."
tuscany.21.a: "We cannot risk intervention"
tuscany.21.b: "We must weaken Austria's sphere"
tuscany.22.t: "A Leader for the Movement"
tuscany.22.d: "Many prominent figures have risen to the loose leadership circles of the secret societies and radical groups in Tuscany. As the time is approaching for our movement to rise up against the Duke, a leader must be singled out. Many point to Ricasoli - A prominent liberal politician and someone who could represent the hidden agenda of our revolutionary council without making our members' ideology known. Others call on Niccolò Tommaseo who has been in Tuscany since 1857. Tommaseo held important positions in the Republic of San Marco during the revolutions of 1848 and has held firm against Sardinia-Piedmont becoming a power in Italy."
tuscany.22.a: "Tommaseo shall lead once again"
tuscany.22.b: "The people trust Ricasoli already"
tuscany.23.t: "Revolutionary Spirit"
tuscany.23.d: "There is a certain spirit around Tuscany as of late. The feeling of revolution is in the air as both radicals and liberals join forces in preparing to launch a revolution against the Duke and his oppressive regime. Italians across the peninsula who have been made aware of the plan, through our network of secret societies and operatives, are flocking into Tuscany in order to join in the fight for true liberty in Italy."
tuscany.23.a: "First we liberate Tuscany, then the whole of Italy"
tuscany.24.t: "Subverting Austrian Influence"
tuscany.24.d: "Despite most of their garrisons having left, the Austrian still exert a level of influence over the politics of our nation. The Austrians may be willing to invade once again should our goals be made clear to them too quickly. We must play a dangerous game of politics in order to keep the Austrian eyes away from our activites. As soon as we can convince them to have their garrisons leave the country entirely, we will have more room to expand operations."
tuscany.24.a: "They must think nothing is amiss..."
tuscany.25.t: "Tuscan Radicals Request Arms"
tuscany.25.d: "The Radical movement in Tuscany has requested that we supply them with arms. It is no secret that we would benefit from a weaker Austrian sphere of influence in Italy and supporting the Tuscan movement to break away from the Pro-Austrian Duke Leopold II would help to weaken the Austrian grip on the Italian peninsula."
tuscany.25.a: "Supply them with Arms"
tuscany.25.b: "We cannot support them"
tuscany.28.t: "[FROM.GetDef] Declines Assistance"
tuscany.28.d: "Our request for assistance has been decline by [FROM.GetDef]. Perhaps they were unwilling to risk any diplomatic issues that could have arisen or maybe they just didn't care to support our movement. Hopefully we can make do without their help."
tuscany.28.a: "Unfortunate"
tuscany.29.t: "The French Accept our Request!"
tuscany.29.d: "The French have accepted our request for arms. Their government is just as eager as we are to see Austrian influence in the Italian peninsula weakened. There is no doubt they may have other motives for supporting us but we cannot be concerned with those now. These arms will help our fight."
tuscany.29.a: "Merci France!"
tuscany.26.t: "Tuscan Radicals request Goods"
tuscany.26.d: "The radical movement in Tuscany has requested that we supply them with goods. It is no secret that after their betrayal in the Crimean War we have not had strong relations with the Austrians. It may be time to have the Austrians weakened in their sphere of influence."
tuscany.26.a: "Supply them with Goods"
tuscany.26.b: "We cannot support them"
tuscany.30.t: "The Russians Accept our Request"
tuscany.30.d: "Though somewhat surprising, the Russians have agreed to supply us with some goods in order to assist in our fight against Austria and her puppet government in Tuscany. The Austrian Empire betrayed Russia in the Crimean War and it is clear that Russia has not forgiven them yet."
tuscany.30.a: "These will help our men"
tuscany.27.t: "Tuscan Radicals Request Supplies"
tuscany.27.d: "The Radical movement inside Tuscany has requested that we send supplies to assist them in their revolution against Duke Leopold II and furthermore Austria should they intervene to support the Duke. Though we have stayed somewhat neutral in Italy in the past, our politicians have shown interest in helping the people of Central Italy who have been caught between the desires of Sardinia-Piedmont and Austria."
tuscany.27.a: "Set up a Supply Chain"
tuscany.27.b: "We cannot help them"
tuscany.31.t: "The British Send Supplies"
tuscany.31.d: "Due to support for our cause within the British parliament, the British have accepted our request for supplies. The Tuscan economy is not built to sustain war, let alone to supply a war effort, so these supplies will assist not only our troops but also our civilian industry in ensuring our economy does not collapse."
tuscany.31.a: "Thank our friends in parliament!"
tuscany.32.t: "Tuscans Request Withdrawal of our Garrison"
tuscany.32.d: "Ever since the Revolutions of 1848/, in which the Grand Duchy of Tuscany turned it's forces against us, we have maintained a modest garrison in the city of Florence to deter further revolutionary action. Leopold II eventually came around to accept our demands, which included a removal of the Tuscan Constitution, and our influence has been strong there ever since. Recently, however, the people of Tuscany have grown discontent with our influence being exerted over them. We have received a request from the Grand Duke himself that our garrisons expedite their exit from Tuscany so that a transition of power from the Duke towards a parliament and prime minister may occur unheeded.\n\n Many of our politicians claim that with the current European attitude in Italy not being in our favor, trying to intervene could come at an extreme cost. We also run the risk of Sardinia-Piedmont and her allies taking advantage of the situation to capture what Italian lands we do still hold."
tuscany.32.a: "We have no choice but to comply"
tuscany.33.t: "Austrian Garrison Withdrawn!"
tuscany.33.d: "The Austrian Empire has agreed to withdraw the rest of their garrison from Florence, likely due to international favor turning away from them and fear of Sardinia-Piedmont and her allies taking advantage of the situation. Now that the garrison is gone the transition of power from Duke Leopold II towards the Prime Minister and parliament can begin. Citizens in Florence celebrated throughout the night, this time without the Austrians watching."
tuscany.33.a: "We can all let out a sigh of relief now"
tuscany.34.t: "Invasion of the Papal Marche"
tuscany.34.d: "In order to reach Naples before Gariabldi and his forces do, we will need to enter the Papal Marche. Currently, France has garrisoned many troops in the Papal States and is actively protected their lands from any invasion. However, with Garibaldi announcing plans to march on Rome and Venice, France may be forced to allow our troops to occupy the Marche in order to stop Garibaldi from advancing his conquests."
tuscany.34.a: "If we must, we can force their hand"
tuscany.35.t: "Tuscany Requests to Enter the Papal Marche"
tuscany.35.d: "With a declaration from Garibaldi that he intends to conquer both Rome and Venice after capturing Southern Italy, there is increased fears within Europe of what kind of movements he could inspire if he is not stopped. Recently, a delegation from Tuscany has suggested that they be allowed to enter the Papal Marche and stop Garibaldi in Naples before he can continue with his plans."
tuscany.35.a: "We have no choice but to comply"
tuscany.36.t: "Invasion of the Papal Marche"
tuscany.36.d: "The French, likely forced to accept by international pressure, has conceded to our request to enter the Papal Marche. The Papal States has not taken kindly to our troops and has put up some resistance. Our troops should be able to handle them easily and then move on to the South to meet with Garibaldi's forces."
tuscany.36.a: "Onwards!"
tuscany.37.t: "Riots and Resistance"
tuscany.37.d: "Following the rise of a liberal government in Tuscany with aspirations for uniting Italy, many in our nation became sympathetic to their cause. Despite hopes to eventually annex the Tuscan government into our own, the Tuscans had approached us regarding merging our governments. When we declined, an open state of war was opened between our nations. Many have taken to the streets decrying this war as an act of aggression on our part. Radical and Liberal agents alike are painting our government to be elitist and opposed to liberalization in Italy."
tuscany.37.a: "We must crush them quickly"
sardinia_news.18.t: "Tuscany Empowers their Parliament"
sardinia_news.18.d: "In the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, led by Duke Leopold II, a great shift in governmental powers is underway. The Grand Duke has allowed the Prime Minister to become the head of government and begin preparations to revive the weakened parliament in Tuscany. Duke Leopold II will serve as Head of State in a similar fashion to the United Kingdom's monarchy. This shift away from Autocracy comes just a decade after the Austrian Empire forced the Duke to repeal the Tuscan constitution, and this action brings many questions as to the future of the Italian Peninsula."

NSC_1848_revolution_legacy: "Legacy of the Revolutions of 1848"
NSC_1848_revolution_legacy_desc: "The revolutions of 1848 consisted of several riots and uprisings organized by liberal and Carbonari committees with the first one starting in Messina on September 1, 1847 and ending with the Sicilian revolution that culminated in an independent Sicily for 16 months before it was crushed by King Ferdinand II’s troops on May 15, 1849.\n\n Despite having forced Ferdinand to grant a new, more liberal constitution, it all fell apart when the members of the chambers of deputes couldn’t agree on what oath that should be taken. This gave the king an excuse to dissolve the national parliament and crush all uprisings. Since the King has ruled as an absolute monarch, the revolutionary leaders who haven’t fled into exile has either been killed or are languishing in prison."

Its aim was to start an uprising in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and from there continue on to achieve Mazzini’s goal, a unified Italy based on Social Democratic Republicanism. In short to achieve what the revolutions of 1848 tried but failed to do However, the expedition met a bloody end when it reached Campania and failed to get the support of the local population. Pisacane himself died in the small town of Sanza, it is unclear if he committed suicide or was killed by the inhabitants."

NSC_ferdinand_ii_reign_desc: "From being a fairly popular monarch in the early years of his reign he is now more known for his repressive tendencies. There is no love for the king among the liberals in his realm nor among the Sicilian inhabitants that remember the looting and raping committed by his troops. The savage shelling by a naval flotilla of the city of Messina, killing many civilians after the city had surrendered, has earned him the nickname re bomba, “King Bomb”."
NSC_continue_political_arrest: "Continue Political Arrests"
NSC_continue_political_arrest_desc: "It is clear after last years cowardly attempt against the king’s life and this years attempt to start an uprising in Campania that we cannot let our guard down. This, so called revolutionaries, must be hunted down. One of our top priorities is Giuseppe Mazzini tried and condemn to death, for his involvement in both attempts he is currently in hiding. He and his accomplices must be found. "

Such a loyal servant needs our full support, especially considering that his own brother, Carlo Troya, is popular among the troublemakers with his support of the Neo-Guelphism movement that wants to unite Italy and have the pope as its king!  We need to show who of the Troya brothers is the true patriot."

NSC_secure_kingdom_desc: "We have managed to keep the pressure up on the troublemakers, forcing them to go into hiding and focusing on staying alive instead of plotting against us. But there is trouble from abroad too, both France and England withdrew their ambassadors in 1856 when we, rightly, decided to follow our own path as a sovereign nation instead of listening to their advice. The most worrisome is the English hostility towards us. They seem to have forgotten the close friendship the house of Bourbon shared with them during the war against Napoleon. There are signs that they want to limit our sovereignty and take control of our Sicilian sulphur. We need to look for new allies the question is where?"

NSC_search_political_allies_desc: "The failed Pisacane expedition made it abundantly clear that only recruiting revolutionaries among our own people won’t be enough. We need international allies that can put pressure on King Ferdinand. Luckily, we have two promising alternatives; Relations between his majesty’s government and France and the United Kingdom are not the best anymore. Napoleon III of France has showed support for Italian independence before and seem to have a soft heart for Italy while, in Britain, the former chancellor and statesman, William Ewart Gladstone, has come out against King Ferdinand’s government in quite harsh terms calling it “the negation of God erected into a system of government”.

He knows how to lead armies as he showed in the crushing of the uprising in Sicily in 1849. But he also showed a liberal streak when he convinced the king to adopt the new constitution the same year, even if the king revoked it only a few months later. Filangieri has also proven himself as a prominent administrator during his time as governor of Sicily where he quickly restored law and order, paying off he debts the islands communes had accumulated during the fighting and restoring the old privileges. He wanted to address some of the islanders’ grievances by trying, and failing, to convince the king to allow a more autonomous Sicilian government. "

two_sicilies.1.t: "Dissolution of the Swiss Regiments"
two_sicilies.1.d: "Following a law proposed by the Swiss government which would make serving foreign militaries illegal by penalty of loss of citizenship, the Swiss regiments in our army turned to revolt. The Swiss 3rd Regiment started the revolt which eventually led to the Swiss Regiments marching towards Capodimonte to seek answers from King Francesco II. Fearing a larger riot, General Nunziante commanded the 13th Hunters Battalion to open fire on the Swiss soldiers. After this event the government has decided it best to dissolve the Swiss regiments and create separate foreign battalions for foreign troops to circumvent laws like the one in Switzerland. Though a few soldiers remain, many of the Swiss and Bavarian volunteers have left the army."

two_sicilies.3.d: "Over 300 prisoners have escaped from a Prison on Ponza Island after they were assisted in a prison break. Many of the prisoners were political prisoners, including many notorious figures from the revolutions of 1848. The Neapolitan authorities have since re-established order at the penitentiary and deployed the Real Marina to survey the surrounding waters for vessels that could be harboring the escaped convicts."

two_sicilies.4.t: "The Sapri Expedition"
two_sicilies.4.d: "An expedition led by Mazzinian Carlo Pisacane into Sapri, Campania, has been put down. Much of the work to apprehend the criminals involved was done by the local populace. Having been informed of a prison break on the island of Ponza prior, the local peasants massacred over 20 of the conspirators and handed 150 over to the gendarmes. Following clashes with the local peasants, Piscane and the rest of his band retreated to Sanza, where they were attacked again by the local populace, losing almost 100 more men. It was there that the sub-chief of Sanza, Sabino Lavegilia, killed Piscane, while one of the other leaders of this expedition, Giovan Falcone, committed suicide.\n\n It has been said of the expedition that the populace of these towns and their city guards were incredibly brutal. Some reported cannibalism, ferocious women chasing men into the forests, and the barbarous slaughtering of the conspirators."

Two of the leading conspirators have been identified as Jessie M. White and her boyfriend Alberto Mario. While nothing major has occurred and the riot did not spread far, Cavour has ordered the police to be on alert for any remaining Mazzinians who might challenge the Piedmont government. The conspirators who are captured are expected to be exiled, same as Mazzini once was."

Conspirators were wearing tricolor armbands and assaulted the city garrison. Luckily, the military command was able to sound the alarm by firing three cannon shots from the Old Fortress. The riot spreaded quickly but reinforcements from the military were easily able to trap the insurrectionists that had attempted to fight on. \n\n Seven of the insurrectionists were lined up on the wall of the Colo palace, where they had attempted to hold out, and shot by order of Major Giovanni Traditi.

To obtain Austrian support, they were prepared to guarantee the status quo in Italy. Only Piedmont was in a position to disrupt it at that time, and Cavour negotiated an alliance with the Western powers. In May he sent to Crimea an army that performed brilliantly. As a result, Piedmont was able to assume a place among the victors at the Congress of Paris (February 1856). From this platform Cavour, achieving a diplomatic coup for Piedmont and Italy, declared that the only threat to peace in Italy, and the root cause of subversive plots, was the burdensome Austrian overlordship. Cavour’s pronouncements at the congress increased the standing of Piedmont among nationalists."

Italy cannot be truly reunified unless steps are taken to ensure freedom from the meddling Austrians. Luckily, Napoleon III of France shares with us a common enemy. We should send Count Cavour to meet with him, but none must know of this. We will disguise the trip as a mere vacation to Switzerland while Count Cavour will travel on to Plombieres, where the French Emperor has agreed to meet with us. Together, the two leaders will plan an invasion of the Austrian-controlled part of our beautiful peninsula, and drive out foreign influence.

As the economies of Europe begin to shift towards Industrialization—and Piedmont along with it, the island of Sardinia has been left underdeveloped and to be exploited for resources to fuel mainland Industries. The situation in Sardinia is considered volatile by much of the Piedmontese ruling class, hampering any efforts to change the economic or political makeup of the island any further. The question remains on whether Industrialization efforts should be forwarded to the island, or if it can remain strictly a strategic installment, and be of use in other sectors of our economy."

As the woman approached he realized she was crying, and before he could even mouth a word of comfort she revealed a pistol hidden in her basket and shot him. Another Bersaglieri soldier nearby instantly returned fire killing the woman.

The so called barbarians of the south have finally had enough of Piedmontese posturing and terrible living conditions. While the South barely has an ideology to claim Carmine Crocco, the leader of the largest brigand army, has declared himself leader of this Southern Rebellion.

As an experienced politician and leader in Sardinia for many years, and known to some as the \"father of the Risorgimento\" Camillo Benso is a welcome leader for the Northern areas of Italy, though many in the South wonder how the Piedmontese officials will treat the rest of the kingdom."

ita.43.d: "A progressive and reformer, Urbano Rattazzi is a famous face in Italian politics. Leading the old Democratic party of Sardinia, Rattazzi once formed a coalition with Cavour in favor of moderate political ideology. As unification came under way Rattazzi has shifted in his views slightly, his nationalism is very high and he did not support the idea of transferring Nice and Savoy putting him at odds with the Right parties. The Right isn't his only enemy, the Clerical parties also take issue with many of his policies. Many find his election a surprise given his track record."

ita.44.t: "Agostino Depretis of the Great Centre"
ita.44.d: "Agostino Depretis is not a known character in Italian politics to many, but he is not new to the scene. An important part of unification politics, Depretis stood up against the Count of Cavour on many topics and even met with Garibaldi in Sicily to discuss the transfer of power. Not many expected Depretis and his up and coming leftist party to make any gains in the election, but the polarization of the other parties may have encouraged the sudden shift."

Though no longer openly subscribing to the radical ideology of Mazzini, the Intransigents still are the furthest left of any party in the election. Their victory is surprising to many who assumed that the powers in Piedmont would never allow the ideology of the radicals to spread much further than it already has."

ita.46.t: "The Regional Economic Focus"
ita.46.d: "By focusing on regional economic strengths rather than applying one economic law to the entire nation we have been able to successfully revamp the Southern Economy somewhat. The industries of the South have been able to benefit from the appointment of new economic ministers in the country. This comes after the Right Group led by Cavour suggested the transition of the entirety of Italy switch to Free Trade laws. Our experts predict that if we had followed that route Southern Industry would have suffered."
ita.46.a: "The South will be Revived"
ita.47.t: "The Southern Menace"
ita.47.d: "Politicians and Citizens alike have easily adopted the thinking of the Piedmontese politicians that the South in a menace to the rest of Italy. Northern officials and peoples have always viewed the South as lagging behind the rest of the peninsula. The South was the last to liberalize their constitutions, and many claim the people themselves are \"barbaric\" and \"uncivilized\". "
ita.47.a: "How United are We?"
ita.48.t: "Leftist Policies Reach Parliament"
ita.48.d: "With our approach towards the new Italian Economy and the position of our leaders, many members of the Parliament and Chambers have been able to bring Leftist policies into the parliament. These policies are usually despised by the Right wing politicians who claim they support the South more than the North, but by boosting the economy of the South the entire Italian Economy will be stronger. Despite these policies being tailored towards the Southern Economy, the agrarian citizens of the South have been angered by the posting of Leftist Politicians in their region. Somehow there is still strong Monarchist and Conservative sentiment and a few larger towns have seen protests. In the long run these policies will decrease Southern Resistance, but initially we may face some backlash."
ita.48.a: "Nobody said it would be easy"
ita.49.t: "The Effects of Land Reform"
ita.49.d: "As Parliament debates the land reform law to put in place in the South of Italy, many question what effect this law will have on the nobility that is present in the South. So far they have been compliant with the new Italian Government, but many suggest that the Land Reform bill, which will greatly weaken their power, will see their neutrality come to an end. The people wait to hear what the Parliament decides..."

ita.50.t: "Choosing Sides in the American Civil War"
ita.50.d: "With the American Civil War going on and our nation being newly united our government faces a tough decision. The Confederate States would seek to use our ports as a place for their ships to dock and repair away from the eyes of the Union. The Union will seek to have our guarantee that the Confederates will not have this right and we would not recognize them as a legitimate state. Whatever decision our government makes it will have a lasting impact on our relations with whatever state comes out of the Civil War."

This could be a sign of a lasting relationship with the new state, as we have already traded with many of the nations prior to unification."

ita.52.t: "Italy Offers Docking Rights"
ita.52.d: "The question of where our navy might be safe to travel has been hard to find an answer for, until now. In a surprising turn of events the new Italian State has foreignd the rights for our ships to enter their long coastline and dock when needed whether under chase of the Union navy, or heavy weather. This could be a major breakthrough in getting major European nations to recognize our state as a legitimate one."
ita.52.a: "Great News!"
ita.53.t: "Italy Gives Confederacy Docking Rights"
ita.53.d: "In a surprising turn of events the new Italian State to grant them docking rights. This was a concern that many in our government did not expect to see come true. With recognition from a European state all but confirmed, many fear other European powers might feel less hesitant to recognize or support the Confederacy going forward."

This new shared policy will help Italian companies to enter and compete more easily in the global marketplace through reduced trade barriers and, in consideration of the United Kingdom’s global reach, easy access to vital resources that would otherwise be hard to access through Mediterranean mercantilism."

ita.57.t: "The French Empire Declines our Free Trade Proposal"
ita.57.d: "Napoleon, after much consideration, has denied our trade treaty proposal.

PIE_Monaco_resolved: "The Monaco Question has been Resolved"
monaco.1.t: "The Status of Monaco"
monaco.1.d: "Following the Congress of Vienna, Monaco was transferred to the Kingdom of Sardinia as a protectorate. The Treaty of Stupinigi in 1817 formalized the relationship between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Protectorate of Monaco. The treaty was overall devastating for Monaco and much of the wealth of the nation was lost, which was further inflamed when a majority of the nation declared independence during the Revolutions of 1848. Since then the areas of Roquebrune-Menton have been under the Savoy administration to cease violence in the area. As the struggle for unification is underway, many question what status Monaco will play in it. Shall Monaco be transferred to France along with Savoy and Nice in exchange for French support, or should we fight to ensure Monaco remains apart of the Italian sphere?"

monaco.2.a: "Let the Meeting Begin"
monaco.3.t: "Meeting with Sardinian Officials"
monaco.3.d: "Following the build up of Sardinian influence and a diminishing of autonomy the Sardinia-Piedmont government has organized a meeting between Charles III and their officials. This meeting will likely decide the future of our nation and our people."
monaco.3.a: "Let the Meeting Begin"
monaco.7.t: "The Future of Monaco?"
monaco.7.d: "As the meeting is getting underway the topic of Monaco's future is what is on everyone's mind. It is clear the Monaco officials are unsure what position we have currenlty, but our government has two options. We can either try to enforce the protectorate status to be made more permanent or push for annexation of Monaco into our nation."
monaco.7.a: "Enforce the Protectorate Status"
monaco.7.b: "Push for Annexation"
#monaco.9.t: "The Status of Monaco"
#monaco.9.d: "In the treaty between us and Sardinia-Piedmont to cede Nice and Savoy in return for our alliance in the war against Austria we had expected that Monaco would be returned to our nation. Monaco had been apart of Napoleon I's empire and was ceded to Sardinia during the Congress of Vienna. While officially signing the treaty today it was revealed that Monaco would not be transferred to our nation. While disappointing there is nothing we can do in this situation."
#monaco.9.a: "That is too bad"
monaco.4.t: "Sardinia Seeks to reaffirm Protectorate"
monaco.4.d: "As the meeting between Charles III and the Sardinian Officials has reached a point of culmination. The Sardinian officials have announced that they wish to sign a treaty that will ensure that the Protectorate status of Monaco is not disturbed while their attempts at unification go on. It is unclear if this is the best option yet, but it is certainly better than occupation. Many in our government say we should ask to be transferred to France if Sardinia takes that option, though some have pointed out that with the rebellions in the country annexation may be better than the status quo. The question of independence was also tossed around, though it is unclear if Sardinia would be willing to let that happen."

monaco.5.a: "Perfect"
monaco.6.t: "Monaco requests Independence"
monaco.6.d: "Following our suggestion of continuing the protectorate the officials on the other end have requested that Monaco be given independence from our government. Their offer in return is that they will not join France in the event that Nice and Savoy are lost or another situation arises."
monaco.6.a: "We will enforce our terms by force!"
monaco.6.b: "Independence is a good compromise"
monaco.8.t: "Monaco requests to be transferred to France"
monaco.8.d: "Following our suggestion that Monaco reaffirm it's position as a protectorate under our government the officials representing Monaco have requested that Monaco be transferred to France in the Treaty of Turin."
monaco.8.a: "Transfer Monaco"
monaco.8.b: "We will enforce our terms by force!"
monaco.9.t: "Sardinia proposes Annexation"
monaco.9.d: "The meeting with Sardinian officials reached a boiling point after increasing tension in the room. The point was made by some of the officials from Monaco that Victor Emmanuel was not present for this meeting, unlike the kings before him who attended the first treaties with Monaco. Following some harsh words a small scuffle broke out between both sides. Closing the meeting off with a band, the Sardinians have presented their treaty which demans that Monaco surrender its independence in order to allow Sardinia to liberate it."
monaco.9.a: "We have no choice but to submit"
monaco.9.b: "Perhaps if we apologize something can be worked out..."
monaco.10.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Agrees"
monaco.10.d: "Following a back and forth between the officials of our nation and Sardinia-Piedmont we have been able to convince the opposing side to agree to our proposition. This is great news considering our seemingly insignificant power in the talks."
monaco.10.a: "Great"
monaco.11.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Declines, Occupation Likely"
monaco.11.d: "After taking insult to our counter-offer, the Sardinian officials have announced that they will settle for nothing less than the occupation of our nation as the steps are taken to integrate Monaco into the new Italian state."
monaco.11.a: "This is a Disaster!"
monaco.12.t: "Monaco Requests Status Quo"
monaco.12.d: "Following our demand that Monaco submit to our occupation, they have issued an apology for their behavior in the meetings between our nation's officials. They have sent their proposed treaty which outlines Monaco remaining as a protectorate as long as their is an Italian government to defend it."
monaco.12.a: "Accept the deal"
monaco.12.b: "Annexation, and nothing less"
monaco.13.t: "Monaco Transferred to France"
monaco.13.d: "As part of the Treaty of Turin, the protectorate over Monaco has been transferred to our nation. This finally corrects the loss of Monaco in the Congress of Vienna."
monaco.13.a: "Welcome Back"
monaco.14.t: "Principality of Monaco"
monaco.14.d: "The treaty of Stupinigi, signed by both the former Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars confirmed our place under the protection and oversight of Sardinia-Piedmont. The treaty distinctly specifies “This land shall never fall under a foreign government,” which was unanimously agreed upon during negotiations despite the uneasy relationship between our Royal House and the House of Savoy. Consequently, weariness over lofty taxes and blatant abuse of power has pushed Rocabrüna and Mentone, which make up over 95% of our territory, into declaring union with Sardinia-Piedmont—an action to which Sardinia wholehearted embraced and has since sent three militia brigades to enforce. The destabilization and stagnation of Monaco leaves for a generally uncertain future, however, our noble-hearted and stalwart Prince Charles III, stands firm, ready to guide our nation through any storm or sickness to come."

sardinia.1.t: "The Crimean War"
sardinia.1.d: "Camillo di Cavour was under orders of Victor Emmanuel when 15,000 soldiers under the command of General Alfonso La Marmora landed in Russia. The intervention in the war was in a bid to gain recognition from major nations - France especially - to assist in the issue of Italian Unification. The bravery and courage of the soldiers who fought in the Battle of the Chernaya and the siege of the Sevastapol earned Sardinia a seat at the Peace Conference, and the dream of unification was becoming a reality."
sardinia.1.a: "Let us Remind Europe of this"
sardinia.2.t: "Sardinian Diplomacy"
sardinia.2.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont, the up-and-coming kingdom in Italy was, until recently, a lesser nation with little to no diplomatic power. Known only for it's failure to defeat the Austrians in the past, the entrance and performance of Sardinia in the Crimean War changed this completely. Now that the Sardinians hope to undertake steps towards unification, they have been insistent that Europe not forget their actions in this war."
sardinia.2.a: "They fought well"
sardinia.6.t: "Diplomacy with the British"
sardinia.6.d: "Diplomacy with the British rests largely in the friendship of Camillo Benso and the British Legation in Turin - James Hudson. James Hudson himself is quite the italophile, and his position in Turin - held since the days before Benso was prime minister - has convinced him of the need of support for the unification movement. Though he faces some ridicule at home for his position as a favorable ally of Camillo Benso, he will be a key instrument for Sardinia in the attempts to get British support for Unification."
sardinia.6.a: "Tell Hudson that Cavour needs to see him"
sardinia.7.t: "Diplomacy with Sardinia"
sardinia.7.d: "James Hudson - the British Legation to Sardinia-Piedmont - has an equal number of allies in enemies in the British Government. The Queen herself is rumored to claim he is too much a friend of the Italians than the British, but nobody in the government will tell you that he is a bad diplomat. Despite his friendship with Cavour and support for Italian unification, Hudson has always kept British interests in mind. Now that the Sardinians are looking for allies in their hopes for Unification communication between our nations is at an all time high. \n The most pressing matter for the Sardinians currently in which they hope to see our position in the case of the Cagliari - a Piedmontese mailing ship with two Brits in the crew which was captured by the neapolitans. The Case is meant to go to parliament where Sardinian officials will make their plea and the fate of British and Sardinian relations will be decided. The date of the session is set for mid-1858."
sardinia.7.a: "Now we wait"
sardinia.8.t: "The Cagliari Case"
sardinia.8.d: "Despite the good relation shared between Cavour and James Hudson, much of the future of the British stake in the peninsula will come down to the Cagliari Case. The Cagliari ship was a Piedmontese Mailing ship captured by the Neapolitans following the failed Sapri Expedition. The British are interested because the crew contained two Brits. The British parliament has agreed to hear the case during the Spring of 1858. It will be here that Sardinian officials will finally be able to plead their case directly to the British Government. Hudson has put in his best words for our cause, but the outcome of this arrangement will be uncertain until it is over."
sardinia.8.a: "Now we wait, and pray for the best"
sardinia.3.t: "The Cagliari Case"
sardinia.3.d: "The Cagliari Case has reached parliament and now we wait to see how the British will rule on this matter. Camillo Benso and a few other Sardinian officials have given testimony in this case, though some sources say they have been rather arrogant about it. Nonetheless this case could prove as an important stepping stone in relations with Britain."
sardinia.3.a: "How do they rule?"
sardinia.4.t: "The Cagliari Case"
sardinia.4.d: "The Cagliari Case - the case of the Sardinian ship with a crew that included a few Brits being captured by Naples - has finally reached Parliament. Though most members of Parliament are skeptical that a ruling further than a denouncement of the actions of the Neapolitans is a smart move, James Hudson has managed to convince many that an alliance with the Sardinian state would be smart and beneficial. The arrogance of the Count of Cavour in this case is not helping his position."
sardinia.4.a: "Withdraw the case, denounce the capture of Brits"
sardinia.4.b: "Side with Piedmont"
sardinia.5.t: "England Withdraws the Case!"
sardinia.5.d: "The British Parliament has withdrawn the Cagliari Case and has not made any statement in our support. Out of fears that a war would come out of this case, many of the Earls spoke against siding with our government. Despite some strong calls in our favor, and the argument that the British have an obligation to uphold Maritime Law, they remain unconvinced."

This ruling comes even after skepticism from many of the Earls, but thanks to the efforts of Hudson and our other allies in parliament. This will allow us to open up further cooperation between our governments."

A friend of both Napoleon III and Cavour, he has brought news that the French are seeking an alliance with our nation against the Austrians in order to finally remove them from the Italian Peninsula and support our cause for unification. The Orsini Affair is likely to have increased the urgency for the French to take a side in the Risorgimento, and it seems that have made the correct choice of siding with us."

However, Nigra informed Henri of an already existing alliance between Russia and Sardinia-Piedmont which is now cause for concern in the French leadership.

sardinia.66.d: "It is expected that the French alliance will not be concluded and should we refuse to concede some degree of territory coveted by the french. It is expected that the French Empire will seek to gain Nice and Savoy, having previously occupied them briefly during the Napoleonic wars, french authorities are well aware that without said territories, southern France will be left with a broad breach in it’s geographical defensibility. While Sardinia-Piedmont’s ruling class believes in the principles of nationalism, in which Savoy would undisputedly belong to the French nation, Nice has long since been a core Italian land. The loss of Nice would be an evident circumstantial dismissal of our core principals, and would likely infuriate the Piedmontese populace. Additionally, Napoleon III insists on the marriage of Prince Napoleon Bonaparte and Victor Emanuel II’s eldest daughter- Maria Clotilde, to solidify our alliance. Prince Napoleon has an egregious reputation of partying and other lewd activities, and would surely mistreat Maria.The King is not eager to see the marriage go through, but is prepared to make the sacrifice for Italy."

Our participation in the Crimean war assured the grievance of Italian Unification would become a topic of debate amongst European circles once again. The upcoming Plombieres arrangement with Emperor Napoleon III of the French Empire provides us with the opportunity to align France under our ambitions to expel Austria from influencing Italy and our long standing goal of uniting the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia with our own.

With only the King and the Piedmontese military commander, General La Marmora, being aware that Cavour’s final destination was to Plombières, and Cavour having rented a fine cottage on the outskirts of the small town, his meeting with Napoleon III is about to be underway. With expectations for Napoleon to arrive in front of Cavour’s cottage by the afternoon in a carriage, in which the two statements will take a stroll through the quiet streets of Plombières discussing the terms of the anticipated alliance. The leadership composition of the alliance’s forces, a suitable casus belli against Austria, and the structuring of Italy upon victory are primary concerns."

Napoleon has made clear his determination to support Sardinia-Piedmont with all his strength under the single condition that the war against Austria would not be fought for revolutionary cause, and can be justified in diplomatic terms. The obvious contenders for proposal in order to sooth Napoleon's concerns are that of Austria’s consistent violation of trade treaty obligations, which may be too weak a justification for a use of aggression; as well as that of the Austrian garrison in Bologna, to which the Papacy has not permitted to indefinitely reside. While the garrison in Bologna may prove a sufficient justification and gain favor among other European powers, French troops are currently stationed in Rome, and the parallels may raise the question of French hypocrisy."

However, neither are suitable to use in order to wage a war of the scale we need to. The proposed casus belli's being enforcing trade treaty obligations, and using the Bologna Garrison by the Austrians as an excuse for war. With the parallels between our troops in Rome and the Austrians in Bologna, using that as a casus belli could be seen as hypocritical. The trade treaty obligations would not be strong enough to be seen as legitimate cause for war."

sardinia.97.t: "Casus Belli - A Different Approach"
sardinia.97.d: "With our confirming that the two prior suggested Casus Belli would be too weak to wage a war on, our politicians have managed to formulate quite the plan in order to not only provide a cause for war, but to ensure Austria is the attacker. Using the fact that Duchy of Medna and Reggio leader Francis V had refused to accept Napoleon III as the true ruler of France. If the Modense citizens were to request protection from their Austrian-Allied government it would give Sardinia-Piedmont the perfect opportunity to make a statement about Austrian influence in the Italian Peninsula without directly going to war. The outrage in Vienna might just be enough to cause them to go to war."

sardinia.98.t: "Casus Belli - A Different Approach"
sardinia.98.d: "As expected, the trade treaty violations by Austria were considered by Napoleon to be insufficient grounds for war. Napoleon also displayed reluctance to accept the use of the Bologna garrison as a pretext. However, it has transpired that Napoleon has an alternative proposal that he believes could prove a sufficient justification. Using the recent debacle in which the Duke of Modena and Reggio, Francis V refused to recognize Napoleon III as the true ruler of France. If the modenese citizens were to request protection from their Austrian-allied government, it would give Sardinia-Piedmont the perfect opportunity to make a public announcement denouncing Austrian oppression in the peninsula. The subsequent outrage the proclamation might cause just may be enough to cause them to declare themselves the aggressor."
sardinia.98.a: "Ingenious!"
sardinia.99.t: "Political Structure of Italy"
sardinia.99.d: "The geopolitical makeup of Italy, should the war against Austria prove successful, is a point of tension between Sardinia-Piedmont and the French Empire, and may cause a degree of political fracturing within the alliance after the war’s completion. The French maintain the goal of gaining influence across the peninsula through the means of an Italian Confederation, reminiscent of that of which operates in germany. This directly opposes the voter-backed agenda that has become popularized throughout much of Sardinia-Piedmont, advocating for the complete removal of Foreign influence from Italy. Consequently, Sardinia-Piedmont conversely harbors the goal of creating a Northern Italian Kingdom within said confederation, should it’s nationalistic agenda prove unfruitful."
sardinia.99.a: "This will be an interesting topic"
sardinia.100.t: "Our Position on the Confederation"
sardinia.100.d: "As the French prepare to lay out their plan for the Italian Peninsula, we must begin to think about whether the confederation is something that we should go along with. Naturally, we can always give the French our assurances now and see if the future allows us to change the agreement, but we are not in a good position to deny the French goal of domination in Italy. With that we are stuck in this position, with the hope to escape at first chance or at the very least to renegotiate the terms of the confederation."
sardinia.100.a: "We will see what the future holds"
sardinia.101.t: "The North of Italy"
sardinia.101.d: "Under the current plans for the political restructuring of Italy, Cavour and Napoleon agreed that Sardinia-Piedmont under the New Italian confederation ought to be awarded Lombardy-Venetia, what was formerly Venetian Istria, the Duchies of Modena,and  Parma, as well as the Papal Legislations in Romagna to form the Kingdom of Northern Italy. This would see Austria entirely removed from the Italian peninsula, and the creation of a new powerful Independent Italian state."
sardinia.101.a: "Interesting..."
sardinia.102.t: "Central Italy"
sardinia.102.d: "Central Italy would be reorganized under the rule of Roberto I, Duke of Parma. Roberto, being an adolescent, currently entrusts state legislation with Louise Marie Thérèse d'Artois as acting regent. France clearly believes that Louise d’Artois may be more akin to following a policy of clienthood with the French Empire due to her francophone upbringing. This new Central Italian Kingdom would be awarded with the former Duchy of Tuscany, as well as the Marche and Umbrian former Papal Legislations. The Pope in compensation, would be nominated honorary head of the confederation, not that the Papacy has much of a choice."
sardinia.102.a: "Not like we’re in much of a position to complain."
sardinia.104.t: "The South of Italy"
sardinia.104.d: "A fair degree of uncertainty came with discussions on the South of the peninsula, more likely than not, it would remain under the rule of the Bourbon monarchs of the Two Sicilies. However, it is unclear whether or not the Bourbon rulers would be open to the idea of confederation, should they be unable to be convinced of the merits of Neapolitan integration into the proposed confederation, it is almost assured that the Two Sicilies would be awarded to a Bonapartist relative of Napoleon III."
sardinia.104.a: "The final piece of the puzzle"
sardinia.105.t: "Day Two"
sardinia.105.d: "After a long day of negotiations, promises, and signing treaties the previous day, Napoleon is due to pick up Cavour once again to discuss the proposed marriage and finalize the terms of the Franco-Sardinian Entente."
sardinia.105.a: "Lets get it going"
sardinia.106.t: "Military Composition"
sardinia.106.d: "The first and foremost topic of the day perhaps might be the most dire, is that in regards to the military composition of the alliance. Given the war is over Italian soil, Cavour understands that having Sardinia-Piedmont lead the Entente forces in the conflict would constitute a symbolic vengeance for the defeat in 1848. However, the French consider it important that they show dominance in Italy, and use the war as a political ploy for vengeance over the Congress of Vienna’s terms. Whoever leads the military alliance will gain quite the sum of political utility post-war."
sardinia.106.a: "Allow the French to lead"
sardinia.106.b: "Request that we lead"
sardinia.107.t: "The Military Composition"
sardinia.107.d: "As the Piedmontese have sent their request for how the military alliance will be structured, and who will ultimately lead the efforts against Austria there is much to consider. As the dominant power in Europe compared to the Italians it would be more appropriate for us to lead the armies in Italy, however, the Italians are very nationalistic people and the presence of strong Italian leaders could pay off to rally the populace and inspire troops. Either way, the leader of the war will be an important position."
sardinia.107.a: "Accept Lead"
sardinia.107.b: "Deny Piedmont Lead, We just take charge"
sardinia.107.c: "Give the Italians Command"
sardinia.108.t: "Preparations for War"

Given our nations prior experience in fighting the Austrians in Italy, there should be much to learn from the past to implement in the new campaign."

This represents a great victory for the Italian military, and the greater Italian people. With our generals at the helm the armies of Austria will be easily crushed, and the Hapsburgs shall be removed from the Italian Peninsula once and for all!"
PIE_FRA_Plombieres_France_War: "It is of little surprise, but the French have declined our request to lead the military composition of our joint force. The French have the benefit of being a recognized power in Europe, so despite our performance in the Crimean War they have opted to use their generals in most of the command positions. Despite this, our joint force shall have no difficulty removing the Austrian menace from the peninsula."
sardinia.109.a: "Another Topic Settled"
sardinia.110.t: "The Royal Marriage"
sardinia.110.d: "In order to consolidate the new alliance, Napoleon has insisted on having Napoleon III’s rather disgraceful cousin marry the eldest daughter of King Victor Emanuel. There are many reasons as to why the King has been hesitant. The Emperor's brother is not known for his loyalty to companions, and his age difference between the kings daughter it not to ignored. It would not be a prestigious marriage in regards to Sardinia-Piedmont’s standing, but the King is willing to make the sacrifice in order to secure the alliance."

Despite some minor protest from the Italian side, they have relunctantly agreed to host the marriage in Turin at a later date. With that the alliance with Sardinia-Piedmont is sealed."
PIE_FRA_Plombieres_Marriage_Denied: "The Italian Side has reacted quite violently at the previously discussed marriage between Napoleon's cousin Louis and the daughter of King Victor Emmanuel. Citing the difference in age, and Louis' reputation, the Italians have requested that this ceremonial seal of our alliance be cast aside. Though disappointing, ignoring the Italian request could harm relations we just worked hard to improve."

sardinia.113.a: "Thank God"
sardinia.114.t: "The Conclusion of the Meeting"
sardinia.114.d: "With the final deliberations concluded, the two parties may return home from the seclusion of Plombieres, and begin preparations for the imminent war as the alliance detailed. The terms negotiated in the past few days have the capability to reshape the Italian peninsula, and maybe even the entirety of the European continent."

Citing the looming threat of aggression being used by Austria to tyrannize the Italian minor states into adhering to Austrian interests. In particular, as of recent, Austria’s extortion of Francis V of Modena’s refusal to accept Napoleon III as the rightful emperor of France. With nationalist sentiment at an all time high in the Central Italian states, this statement is sure to cause unrest- and bring upon us the fury of the Austrian empire, just as planned.

According to the treaty, we shall only receive Lombardy. Moreover, The Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Duke of Modena will be restored to the thrones of Tuscany and Modena. These States, together with the addition of Venetia, which is to remain firmly in Austrian hands, will be conjoined in an “Italian Federation” overseen by Austria and France. In compensation, Napoleon III has halfheartedly agreed to allow us annexation of Parma, beside Lombardy. This peace both assures the continuity of foreign domination over Italy, and leaves us in a position of vulnerability to which the continuation of the Risorgimento seems unlikely. With a general sense of betrayal by the French, riots have arisen all over the kingdom in protest to the toleration of such agreements."

Since the outbreak of the war the central states largely came under control of Italian revolutionaries and saw Sardinian troops occupy much of the land. Foreign nations insist that the preexisting governments and borders be reinstated, however there seems to be little chance of this due to a lack of enforcement. We will have to wait for the conclusion of these talks before deciding on future policy; however, our generals have advised keeping our garrisons inside of these territories."

We are left in an unfavorable position. The loss of control over our Italian policy has culminated with Sardinia-Piedmont threatening to gain the entirety of the central Italian states, to which they have arranged a provisional government in, and currently occupy. Furthermore, prolonged conflict leaves us with the risk of Prussian opportunistic intervention along the Rhine. Napoleon has gone ahead and signed an alternate agreement with the Austrian’s in the town of Villafranca. Lombardy shall be rightfully ceded to Sardinia-Piedmont, but nothing more. It was agreed that the rulers of Parma, Modena, and Tuscany would be restored to their respective thrones.

This presents us with a unique opportunity, Sardinia-Piedmont has a natural hatred for the Austrians, and now the French have cast aside the Sardinians' favor.

With this change in opinion, the position of the international powers on this issue has staunchly turned against French demands.

The nearly 800 prisoners easily overtook the remaining 40 guards and the two groups seemingly formed a junta together called the \"Commission for Good Order.\" The community has apparently created a statute and has also formed a functioning senate. \n\n Rumors also come from the island of the judicial system in place in the former prison island. Pasquale Urso was sentenced to 50 beatings and 30 days of isolation for stealing flour, Antonio Margiotta for stealing timber and grapes from a vineyard on the island. Margiotta was forced to run around the island with the stolen goods tied around his body. As if things couldn't be any stranger, the Republic of Santo Sefano has also begun handing out death sentences for some who do not uphold the statute. Giuseppe Sabia was guilty of stealing a goat.

He obtained arms and coal under an official license due to his title of major-general of the Royal Army. \n\n Despite the seemingly necessary nature of the stop, reports are developing of another reason for the stop. According to local reports Garibaldi ordered his colonel Callimaco Zambianchi and 64 of the volunteers to leave the expedition in an attempt to cause an insurrection in the Papal States."

sardinia.175.t: "The Papal Insurrection"

After bolstering his force, Zambianchi began looting in the Papal States before being met by pontifical Colonel Georges de Pimodan and his riflemen. Much to our disappointment the Papal troops were assisted by local peasants and Zambianchi was forced to retreat.\n\n [GetLeader] now fears the reaction of France, an ally of the Papal States. He has ordered a ship to sail to Tuscany and arrest Zambianchi, who claims Garibaldi's plan was to convince the Bourbons to leave Sicily undefended in defense of Abruzzo."

sardinia.197.d: "The Expedition was able to land in Marsala and advance inland without much interference from the unprepared Bourbon army. After stopping in Salemi to reorganize the additional Sicilian Volunteers that joined the Expedition, Garibaldi's army advanced to the Bourbon position in a bold offensive manuever. The soldiers of the Neapolitan Hunters were no match for the accuracy of Garibaldi's Hunters and a brave bayonet counterattack. Though initially successfull, Bixio and many of the officers of the Expedition were prepared to retreat when Garibaldi himself rode to the front of the columns declaring that \"Italians, here we must die!\" Seeing the sight of Garibaldi and the morale of the volunteers, the Bourbons retreated in such a fashion that even Garibaldi was too stunned to order a counterattack."
sardinia.197.a: "The Expedition is Saved!"
sardinia.198.t: "The Massacre of Partinico"
sardinia.198.d: "On the advance to Palermo following the battle of Calatafimi, there has been much witness to the destruction left by the retreating Bourbon Army. The disorganized column has enacted forced requisitions on townsfolk in their wake. In the town of Alcamo the column took fire from citizens who heard of Garibaldi's great victory. Rumors of the victory, and that the men of the expedition were supernatural forces, inspired the citizens of Partinico to prepare an ambush for the advancing Bourbon Army. Once in the town center the soldiers were fired upon by citizens. The soldiers managed to respond by burning down over 60 houses, robbing many, and killing some women and children. However, the Bourbon army was already weakened and refused to be stuck in the town, retreating and leaving the wounded. \n\n When Garibaldi arrived in the town he found the citizens had brutally murdered the wounded soldiers left behind. Some were killed in brutal ritualistic killings and tossed on fires of the buildings. One woman, when questioned why the bodies were not buried, responded that \"They do not deserve burial; dogs must eat them.\" "

sardinia.199.t: "Alexandre Dumas Disembarks in Palermo"
sardinia.199.d: "Alexandre Dumas, famous writer, playwright, and personal friend of Garibaldi, has arrived on his yacht in Palermo. Set to be on a cruise the great writer decided to stop in Palermo to unload weapons, a few volunteers, and of course champagne. Dumas is was witness to the Battle of Calatfimi and plans to follow the expedition of the thousand during the conquest of the South. \n\n The arrival of Dumas is also joined by the arrival of many new characters to Palermo. Nandor Eber, correspondent of the British Times, has enlisted as a colonel, and many international newspapers have arrived to witness the battles. One observer wrote that \"In Palermo we do not hear either the thefts, the murders, or the other violence of 1848.\" "
sardinia.199.a: "All support is welcome"
sardinia.200.t: "The Palermo Insurrection"
sardinia.200.d: "The Expedition of the Thousand, reinforced by thousands of Sicilian volunteers, has captured Palermo. Though a stiff resistance was given by the remaining Bourbon troops, and much of the city has been bombarded or set ablaze, the citizens of the Sicilian capital are finally free. Garibaldi has started reorganizing his forces as reinforcements begin to poor in to the port of Palermo in preparation to advance to Messina. \n\n Despite the cheers of victory, many are in mourning in Palermo. English Admiral Mundy, who was present in the port, wrote that \"an entire neighborhood, a thousand and one hundred yards wide, is in ashes; entire families have been burned alive together with their homes, while the atrocities of the royal troops are indescribable.\" "
sardinia.200.a: "The Capital of Sicily has Fallen"
sardinia.201.t: "The Capture of Sicily"
sardinia.201.d: "The island of Sicily has fallen completely to the Expedition of the Thousand and Garibaldi. The last Bourbon troops have signed an agreement with Medici to cease hostilities and embark to Naples. Now with Sicily tamed plans are being drawn for landings in Calabria to surround the Bourbon Army there.\n\n With the capture of Sicily many of the volunteers, now numbering in the tens of thousands, have decided to return to their homes in hopes of rebuilding. The Southern Army is still nearly 20,000 strong but the loss of many of the volunteers will be felt greatly."

sardinia.202.t: "The Landings in Cosenza"
sardinia.202.d: "General Stucco, assisted by troops under Antonio Plutino and more led by Giuseppe Pace, has landed in Cosenza while Nicolò Mignogna has landed with his troops in Basilicata. Bourbon General Giuseppe Ghio and his army are now entrapped between the forces of Garibaldi, now crossing to Calabria, and the volunteers to the North. The Bourbon army has been unable to answer to any of the advancements of the Southern Army. In an incredible series of events, Bourbon general Fileno Briganti was even executed by his own men who were convinced his failures to defeat the advancing armies despite numerical advantages were due to misplaced loyalties. Even more strange is that he was discovered out of uniform supposedly en route to a secret meeting with one of his superiors."

sardinia.203.d: "The Treaty of Zurich signed between our nation, the French, and the Austrians is meant to finalize the agreements of the Villafranca peace we were absent from. Stipulating the return of the monarchs to the Central States, the treaty is seen unfavorably by the new La Mamora government and is not expected to be enforced in any meaningful way, at least not by ourselves."

sardinia.204.t: "The Status of the Central States"
sardinia.204.d: "Despite the Treaty of Zurich outlining the return of the Central States to their respective monarchs, the lands have long since been under control of provisional governments allied to our cause since the first days of our war with Austria.. The French have not encouraged our enforcement of the treaty due to the lack of proper annexation of the Central States. This status quo has only been upset by great demands from the French that have even had other nations comment on their diplomatic strangling of our nation. \n\n The British have been adamant that the French demands are \"subversive of Italian independence.\""

Viva la Garibaldi!!\" The Neapolitan forces sent two companies of the Thirteenth Foot in response to put down the insurrectionists, but the reinforcing companies followed the example of the dragoons. In northern Puglia, the situation is no less bleak for the Bourbons- he Neapolitan forces in Foggia were ordered the troops to leave the town, and initially appeared willing to obey, and assembled readily enough; however  just as they were about to march, they turned to fraternize with the local Lazzaroni. Seeing the region as forfeit under the current circumstances, the Neapolitan command structure in the Puglian expanse has withdrawn to Campania. The relatively well developed region has since proclaimed its union with Sardinia-Piedmont under Victor Emanuel."

sardinia.210.d: "Alessandria has long been a victim to the floods of the Tanaro. Luckily, the parliament of Sardinia-Piedmont took note of the damage caused by the floods and passed a bill to reconstruct \"prismates\" to protect the fortifications of Alessandria against the floods of the Tanaro. The new bolstered defenses will afford us the ability to build safer in the city and provide security to those who had been effected."
sardinia.210.a: "Alessandria is safer now"
sardinia.211.t: "Annecy-Geneva Railroad"
sardinia.211.d: "Negotiated in part by private companies and the respective parliaments of our nations, it has been determined that a railroad between Annecy and Geneva would benefit the Swiss and Savoy people greatly. Annecy is a hub for current trade between Switzerland and Sardinia-Piedmont, and so serves an important role in the economies of both cities. "
sardinia.211.a: "A Worthwhile investment"
sardinia.212.t: "U.S. Consular Relations Report"
sardinia.212.d: "As of yet, the relationship between the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont and the United States of America have been generally cordial. Since the initial act of Mutual recognition in 1802 through U.S. Consular Agent François de Navoni, cooperation between our two states has vastly expanded. On February 7, 1839, the United states accepted the credentials of Count Augusto Avogadro de Collobiano as the first charge d'affaires in Washington from the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, one year later, the United States established a legation in Turin with the first U.S. charge d'affaires presenting his credentials on September 15, 1840. U.S. involvement in the evacuation of Italian Patriots during the wars of 1848 still lingers in the memories of many Sardinian citizens, as well as the minds of the Austrian authorities. The United States, being a fervent defender of self determination and democracy, very well favors our nation. Although, it has become apparent that any direct support from the United States is unlikely, as internal strife and the ideals of manifest destiny gripe the increasingly divided young nation."
sardinia.212.a: "Review Sardinian-American Commercial Relations."
sardinia.213.t: "Commercial Assessment"
sardinia.213.d: "The United States has, as of recently, grown to become a vital and lucrative partner in commerce for our kingdom. Since signing a universally amiable treaty of trade and commerce on November 16, 1838 when U.S. delegates met with King Carlo Alberto, Emanuele II’s father, our two states have enjoyed a pleasant and increasingly advantageous relationship. Shipments of cotton depart the southern states for Sardinian textile manufacturers, where the material plays a pivotal role as a prime material in the production of Piedmontese textile products. Similarly to other northern italian textiles, the textiles from our manufacturers themselves are held amongst the highest regard in the consumerist economies of the northern states. The periodical increase in demand for raw materials, especially cotton due to our ever-expanding industries over the past couple of decades has left Sardinia-Piedmont in a state of near dependency on the lucrative cotton trade with the United States."
sardinia.213.a: "Intriguing..."
sardinia.214.t: "Strategic Assessment"
sardinia.214.d: "In June of 1848, Carlo Alberto granted the U.S. docking privileges in the port town of La Spezia after intense negotiations. The United States greatly values this arrangement, seeing the continuity of its usage as a U.S. docking bay and refueling station within the Mediterranean Sea as of utmost strategic importance. Many conservative politicians in parliament see the agreement as a breach of Sardinia-Piedmont’s national security, citing that in addition to the arrangement displaying subordination, the United States may use its preemptive advantage against us in the case of future conflict between our two states, and advocate for its immediate repeal. While it is universally understood that the United States would be understanding of our rapid change in policy, and retaliation is not a concern, withdrawing such a concession would surely strain relations with the United States, a nation widely considered to be a close confrère of our kingdom."
sardinia.214.a: "This is a direct breach in our national security! Repeal U.S. docking permissions immediately!"
sardinia.214.b: "We have enough enemies as is, best not to cause trouble where it isn’t due."
sardinia.215.t: "Border Infrastructure Investments"
sardinia.215.d: "The Sardinia-Piedmont parliament has suggested that infrastructure in the bordering areas of our nations be upgraded. National roads near the border are significantly lacking in proper maintenance and with increased traffic between our nations, whether that be trade or movement of people, an upgrade is likely in order. A joint Swiss-Sardinian project could make quick work to upgrade the existing roads."

sardinia.219.d: "As part of our agreement to assist Sardinia in her war against Austria, our troops will station themselves along the Galician border. The Austrians will be forced to station their own troops on the border out of fear of attack. If they call our bluff, however, it may extend the opportunity to enter Galicia and take advantage of the situation."

sardinia.220.d: "The Austrians tried to call our bluff that our troops were stationed near Galicia only as a distraction from the Sardinian war! To take advantage of the lack of Austrian presence our troops have advanced into Galicia and were greeted by cheers from the Russophile population. The Austrians have tried to decry our advance but given the reaction of the population and the ongoing war in Italy there is little they can do."

sardinia.221.t: "The Central Italian States"
sardinia.221.d: "With the Galicia Conference taking the minds of Europe off of the Italian Peninsula, solving the issue of the central states will be much easier. Fears over the French taking issue with our government annexing the revolting states in Central Italy have been settled due to the focus on the Galicia conference. Any French protest will be met with no response by the other nations of Europe. We can start the process of annexation by allowing the central states to form their own government for the time being under a relative of King Victor Emmanuel."

sardinia_news.17.d: "As if the Italian Peninsula couldn't get any more chaotic, reports conclude that Tuscany has ambition to unite Italy. The once Grand Duchy of Tuscany has liberalized greatly over the past few years, culminating in a desire to see true liberty for the people of Italy. Prime Minister [TUS.GetLeader] has denounced Sardinia-Piedmont's attempt at unifying the peninsula as an eletist campaign to empower Turin's politicians and the Savoyard Dynasty behind them.\n\n The future of the Italian Peninsula, thought to be secured under Sardinia-Piedmont's control, is now less clear. Tuscany was once a great player in the European stage and it seems that history may be repeating itself. The land of the Medici's may rise to power once again, though this time as a beacon of liberalized government."

sardinia.224.d: "Following an unsuccessful exhibition in Turin in 1850, it was decided that another exhibition should be held in Turin in 1858. The innovations present in the exhibitions and fairs in Paris and London give much prestige to the minds of those respective nations. The Turin Exhibition included many public industrial representatives, showing off work done by Cavour over the last decade to increase the industrial capabilities of Piedmont. However, despite the impressive changes since 1858, it is still evident that Italy is struggling to implement innovations already present in Europe into the industrial sector. King Victor Emmanuel and Cavour were seen together during the exhibition."

sardinia.225.d: "A possible opportunity has come to the table as the plans for supporting Italian Unification are being developed. Discussion that Russia could put troops on the border of Galicia to distract the Austrian army have brought up suggestions that the same could be done in the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldova. Facilitating an arms deal with the principalities may lead the Austrians to fear an invasion from the East, distracting more of their army. The decision will have to be made if we should attempt this so the arms can be sent right away should the principalities accept."

sardinia.231.d: "The urgent exigency for modern steam or other screw-driven vessels to substitute the since antiquated models of the Sardinian fleet has become ever apparent to the Sardinian legislature since Cavour’s inauguration in 1850. Efforts to revitalize the maritime capabilities of Sardinia-Piedmont by the Cavour cabinet have been substantial, with many preeminent warships being added to Sardinia’s minimal array of naval assets. As acting Minister of the Navy, in 1853 Cavour signed a series of accords with the United Kingdom including a variety of orders for vessels to be constructed in the United Kingdom for the Sardinian fleet, including that of four advanced screw-propeller driven steam frigates. Two of these vessels have since been commissioned in the Regia Marina."

Cavour immediately began work on constructing a modern economy for the nation- Closing excessive monasteries, reducing the amount of benefices, and correcting the nation's lopsided spending deficit. In order to finance major public works projects and extensive industrial expansion, as well as to pay off war indemnities to Austria acquired after the war of 1848, Cavour masterfully floated vast internal and international loans, particularly from France and the United Kingdom. The subsequent subsidization of private railway companies and Sardinia-Piedmont diverse artisan-based Industrial sectors has led to the nation’s rise to becoming the most advanced and modern state within the Italian peninsula."

Although the Neapolitan generals had 16,000 soldiers stationed in the toe of Italy prepared to apprehend Garibaldi upon his crossing of the straight, they put up little resistance and many submitted without firing a shot; one battalion surrendered to six wandering garibaldini who had got lost. According to witness accounts from Naples, the Neapolitan minister of war announced the following morning that he was departing for Calabria to defeat Garibaldi and retake Reggio, but then changed his mind that same afternoon due to considerations of his presence in the capital being essential to prevent disorder."
sardinia.246.a: "Even the people of Naples are discontent"
sardinia.247.t: "Reggio-Calabria falls to the forces of Garibaldi"
sardinia.247.d: "In Calabria the Piedmontese-backed lazzaroni laid siege to the city of Reggio-Calabria upon crossing the strait of Messina. Although 16,000  of our brave soldiers were stationed in the toe of Italy prepared to apprehend Garibaldi upon his crossing of the straight, they were vastly outnumbered, being no match for the savage mob, the survivors were forced to pull out of the establishment to regroup with the remainder of our forces in northern Calabria; Our minister of war announced the following morning that he planned to depart for Calabria to defeat Garibaldi and retake Reggio, but then changed his mind that same afternoon due to considerations of his presence in the capital being essential to prevent disorder."
sardinia.247.a: "Naples will stand strong"
sardinia.248.t: "Borsalino Luxury Hat Company Founded in Alessandria"
sardinia.248.d: "Borsalino was founded recently in the city of Alessandria, making it the first luxury clothing brand in the Italian peninsula specializing in hats and other related accessories. The founder, Giuseppe Borsalino, has gained notoriety in the region for his particular model of felt hat, setting Borsalino apart from other European competition."
sardinia.248.a: "What fine accessories!"
sardinia.249.t: "The Romanian Officer in Garibaldi's Army"
sardinia.249.d: "Nicolae Dunca, previously an officer in the Romanian army under Alexandru Ioan Cuza, has made a name for himself within the Expedition of the Thousand. Due to his extensive knowledge of Hungarian, Dunca had joined the Hungarion legion commanded by Figyelmessy and sailed with the original thousand towards Sicily. After the Battle of Volturno, Garibaldi took notice of the skill of the young officer and promoted him to a cavalry captain."
sardinia.249.a: "He makes us proud"
sardinia.249.b: "His story is one of many"
sardinia.250.t: "The Revolutions of 1848"
sardinia.250.d: "In 1848, many revolutions struck Italy, notably having started at the autonomous city of Palermo in Sicily, separatist movements promoting the separation of Sicily from Naples, and adopting a more liberal government. The former of which was quickly suppressed by the king, but the latter was accepted and Ferdinand II of Two Sicilies became the first of many to support a liberal constitution. Others quickly followed, including Leopold II of Tuscany, Charles Albert of Sardinia-Piedmont, and Pope Pius IX of the papacy.\n\nThe Austrian government thought otherwise, as they did not yield to the pressure for liberal reform in their Italian holdings. Instead, garrisons had reinforced the borders of Lombardy-Venetia and had opposition leaders arrested in Venice and Milan. Only a few days later, a sudden wave of revolutionary insurgents swept across the Austrian Empire while Venetian and Milanese insurgents moved to depose their Austrian overlords. Within only a few days the Austrian army retreated, and nearly all of Lombardy-Venetia was in control of the revolutionaries. It took a matter of months for the Austrian Empire to retake control of the state from the rebels and left a scar that will cripple the empire for years to come."
sardinia.250.a: "Tell me more..."
sardinia.251.t: "The Failure of 1848"
sardinia.251.d: "Calamitous discord had swathed across European soil and the Austrian Empire had suffered the worst in its Italian land of Lombardy-Venetia. More importantly, King Charles Albert had conceded to the liberals who aimed to establish a constitutional monarchy. Following the transition, he would go on to march his army into Austrian territory to support the rebels in Venice and Milan. His army was joined by soldiers from the then liberalized governments of Duke Leopold II in Tuscany, King Ferdinand in the Two Sicilies, and volunteers from Sicily and the Papal States. Despite some success in the dawn of his campaign, King Charles’ army would later be defeated at the Battle of Custoza, forcing a humiliating armistice until peace negotiations could be made. The defeat saw all the liberal governments but Sardinia-Piedmont crumble to the Austrian demand for the renouncement of constitutions and the confirmation of absolutism."
sardinia.251.a: "That brings us to now..."
sardinia.252.t: "Rally against the Austrians"
sardinia.252.d: "The kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia stands as the last independent Italian state, still refusing to succumb to Habsburg influence. The southern Kingdom of Two Sicilies has married into the Habsburg Empire, Venezia has been given to the Austrians after the Congress of Vienna, and the smaller states are under Austrian protection. Our people support a strong and powerful government, centered around our king, who vows to fulfill the dreams of a united Italy. As we stand as a barrier between Austrian and French spheres, if we play our cards right, perhaps we can tumble the Austrian tower of cards."
sardinia.252.a: "Our time has come"
sardinia.253.t: "The Protectorate of Monaco"
sardinia.253.d: "The Congress of Vienna had transferred the protection of Monaco from the French to Piedmont via the Treaty of Stupinigi, as well as full dominion over the state. The treaty states, “This land shall never fall under a foreign government,” which was unanimously agreed upon in negotiations despite an uneven relationship between our king and the King of Monaco. With the people, we are feared, as we have sent many garrisons to destabilize and annex parts of the Principality."
sardinia.253.a: "More things to handle..."
sardinia.254.t: "Long Live Italia!"
sardinia.254.d: "Traveler and influential writer, Maxime Du Camp has written many wondrous novels of his times in Italy, including his participation in Giuseppe Garibaldi's Expedition of the Thousand. Maxime writes of hearing the loud crowds of Naples, following the plebiscites, shouting, “Long live Italy!” Afterwards, many members of the crowd asked him what “Italy'' was, as Italy had been nothing more than a geographical region after the fall of the Romans and the split into a multitude of smaller Italian states. Not the mention many of the Southern Italians lack any formal education."
sardinia.254.a: "How Embarrassing"
sardinia.255.t: "Warrior Queen of the Two Sicilies"
sardinia.255.d: "The Germanic queen to Francesco II of Two Sicilies, Queen consort Maria Sophie of Bavaria, has demonstrated her valor in the heat of battle. General Garibaldi's Expedition of The Thousand has proven well for our cause in unifying Italy under one banner, but his march on Naples was obstructed by the fortress of Gaeta. In the midst of the siege, the Sicilian queen was witnessed benevolently supporting her soldiers, caring for the wounded, and even taking up arms with them. Her bravery is admired by the Piedmontese people. Regina guerriera; Warrior Queen!"
sardinia.255.a: "Though they have lost, they fought till the end"
sardinia.256.t: "October Campaign Massacre"
sardinia.256.d: "General Cialdini of the Northern Army has been advancing south for quite some time now, during his so-called October Campaign after the capture of Campania and garrisoning the two cities of Pontelandolfo and Casalduni. The murder of 45 Piedmontese garrisons angered Cialdini, causing him to single out and execute Pro-Bourbonist soldiers and civilians. What has been most embarrassing for the national government is his ruthlessness and lack of prudence in determining whether or not the victims truly supported bourbonism. A humiliation for the Italian people, murdering our own."
sardinia.256.a: "The war will be over shortly..."
sardinia.257.t: "Nizzardo-Exodus"
sardinia.257.d: "Concomitantly and following the annexation of Nice and its surroundings from the Kingdom of Sardinia to France, in application of the agreements signed between the governments of our two countries during the Second Italian War of Independence. It has become an evident consequence, that an estimated quarter of the Nizzardi population in Nice, especially those of higher class stature have relocated to many Piedmontese towns and communes. While French authorities have dismissed the mass-migration as primarily an issue of retaining Sardinian citizenship, educated classes across Europe can evidently infer the migrations are a direct ramification of forced Francization favored and imposed by French authorities in the region. The rapid abandonment of the native-Italian region is surely a symbolic milestone in the erasure and demographic acclimatization of the historic expanse. Opposition to the French Authority is steadily on the rise after initial street skirmishes with French law enforcement."
sardinia.257.a: "A price needed to be paid..."
sardinia_news.19.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Annexes Monaco"
sardinia_news.19.d: "Following the Congress of Vienna, Monaco had been made a protectorate of Sardinia-Piedmont. The treaty of Stupinigi in 1817 formalized the relationship between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Protectorate of Monaco. The treaty was seen to be detrimental to the economy of Monaco and caused many citizens to lose trust in Prince Charles III. Ever since the Revolutions of 1848, Sardinia-Piedmont has been occupying Menton and Rocabrüna, two regions that declared unification with Sardinia-Piedmont. Now the rest of Monaco has been formerly annexed into the Sardinia-Piedmont. Many question if this was the will of the people of Monaco or the will of politicians in Turin."
sardinia_news.19.a: "Monaco never was very significant..."

sardinia_news.21.t: "The Failure of the Pisacane Expedition"
sardinia_news.21.d: "Carlo Pisacane, along with his band of Sicilian political prisoners and petty theives, has parished following his attempted expedition into Sapri in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Pisacane was though to have been working with Mazzinian circles to attempt to invoke an insurrection against the Bourbon monarchy in the Two Sicilies. The local peasants had been warned ahead of time of the expedition and were told that the members were raiders looking to pillage the local towns. Thanks to the propaganda from the Bourbon authorities, Pisacane and his band were immediately attached by the locals. Despite being able to flee the initial attack, Pisacane and his remaining band were brutally slaughtered by local militia and peasants just days later, with some reports even claiming that cannabilism and other wicked activities were done to members of the expedition.\n     Following the expedition, pro-Mazzini riots broke out in Genoa and Florence before supporters were arrested. In Piedmont, supporters of the plot are rumored to be facing charges that could lead to their exile to England."
sardinia_news.21.a: "The Era of Radicalism in Italy is still upon us"

# state names event
sardinia.11.t: "State Names: English, Regional Dialects, or Italian?"
sardinia.11.d: "This mod gives you the option to play with Italian names for victory-points within Italian territories. Do you want to enable this? For immersion purposes, enabling the regional dialects is highly encouraged! If enabled, all VP’s will appear under their regional dialect denominations, with further decisions upon unification to standardize the Italian language across the peninsula, in part, changing the names of cities. You should be warned that these “dialects” for most of history have been considered languages of their own, and in some instances can vastly differ from their modern designations."
sardinia.11.a: "I want the Italian Names."
sardinia.11.b: "Yes I want the Regional Dialect names!"
sardinia.11.c: "No, keep it in English."

Between 1815 and 1848, fewer and fewer Italians have been content to live under foreign rulers. Public outrage over foreign monopolies, standard of living, and political divide has reached an all time high. Most Italian nationalists look for leadership from the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, the most powerful and politically connected of the states, as well as the only Italian state with Italian native royalty.

A new legal system entered into force in Sardinia, and the last viceroy, Claudio Gabriele de Launay, left Cagliari on 4 March 1848.

PIE_Victor_Emmanuel_Army_HC: "Victor Emmanuel II"
POLITICS_Camillo_Benso_di_Cavour_DESC: "Genevan by birth, his mother brought into the Cavour family the influence of Geneva, a city open to all the political, religious, and social movements of the period. The French Revolution imperiled the possessions of the Cavours because of their close ties with the Ancien Régime, but Camillo's father reestablished the family in an eminent position in Napoleonic society. As the younger son who could not hope for the economic and social position that would fall to his elder brother, Camillo saw a brilliant career open up before him under the protection of the court of Charles Albert, Prince of Savoy. \n\n His lack of enthusiasm for the court position and his open ridicule of the page-boy's uniform he was obliged to wear created controversy and confirmed the growing suspicions of rebellious intent within the young Camillo. He was influenced by the liberal ideas of the French writers Benjamin Constant and François Guizot, and his adversaries remained those of his childhood: paternalistic absolutism; legitimist reactionaries representing the landed interests, the aristocracy, and the clergy; and the union of throne and altar. His father got him appointed mayor of a village south of Turin. Social interests began to absorb him; the problems of poverty and prisoner education became the subjects of his research. In 1834, he wrote a memoir on poverty in Piedmont, which was published the following year in London in the 'Report from His Majesty's Commissioners for Inquiring into the Administration and Practical Operation of the Poor Laws.' A second pamphlet on the history of the Poor Laws in England was edited and published by Cavour in 1835 in Turin.\n\n His transition to politics was completed when King Charles Albert decided to embark on measures of reform and to concede a certain amount of freedom to the press. This prompted Cavour to offer his services as a volunteer until, on being elected a deputy in the Third Legislature, he began to fight for the approval of a peace treaty with Austria, although the extremists of the left wanted to continue a war that was, in effect, already lost. In October 1850, he was offered the post of Minister of Agriculture and soon became the most active and influential member of the Cabinet. The European drama into which Cavour was drawn against his will began in 1854 with the Crimean War, with the combined efforts of France, Great Britain, and Piedmont to secure the prosperity of the Ottoman Empire against the encroaching Russian Empire.\n\n Cavour advocates a complete anti-Austrian movement across the Piedmontese lands to fulfill the Risorgimento and unite the Italian lands, a promise he is willing to keep."
