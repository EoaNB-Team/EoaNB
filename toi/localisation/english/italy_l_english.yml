We will disguise the trip as a mere vacation to Switzerland while Count Cavour will travel on to Plombieres, where the French Emperor has agreed to meet with us.

TUS_the_tuscan_economy:0 "The Tuscan Economy"
TUS_the_tuscan_economy_desc:0 " If we are to become more than just a state to be dictated by foreign powers, we must develop an economy. Turning our focus here will benefit all of Tuscany."
TUS_the_sharecropping_debates:0 "The Sharecropping Debate"
TUS_the_sharecropping_debates_desc:0 "Due to our agrarian economy, it is obvious that sharecropping should be considered, seeing it’s success in the American south with its cotton industry. While a larger harvest would benefit us, this may upset the people as it will most definitely bring more of the poor into debt with landlords. This must be decided before we go any further with agriculture. "
TUS_textile_industry:0 "The Textile Industry"
TUS_textile_industry_desc:0 "The textile industry is something that many have made profits off of, especially in England. We would be foolish to not take advantage of its growth to further boost our economic ambitions."
TUS_the_artisans:0 "The Artisans"
TUS_the_artisans_desc:0 "Like much of the Italian peninsula, our economy is dominated by artisan-based industry. With our economy on the way to growing, it is pivotal that we make use of the artisans within our country. Their skill would be much needed in our workforce, and it will help increase our profits from exports with their talents utilized."
TUS_ridolfis_experiment:0 "Ridolfi's Experiment"
TUS_ridolfis_experiment_desc:0 "Ridolfi is a man that could bring the reform that Tuscany needs. If wages inspire our workers to work harder, perhaps it would be worth trying this. Productivity is what will keep us thriving, especially with our agrarian economy. However, a significant conflict has erupted between Ridolfi’s supporters and his critics. This may be too expensive, which might mean losing more money than we need to. This must be settled as we work on our agricultural sector."
TUS_reform_elsewhere:0 "Reform Elsewhere"
TUS_reform_elsewhere_desc:0 "Despite the promising aspects of Ridolfi's experimentation in the Agricultural sectors, our ministers have never been fond of changes the Tuscan economic outlook. We must look for a different solution, the workers are not the tools we need, though it is becoming clear that the estates might be the ones receiving more power, which will make us more popular with the upper class, the ones with actual power."
TUS_land_reclamation:0 "Land Reclamation"
TUS_land_reclamation_desc:0 " Innovation is what we need and with our agrarian economy, it is a doctrine we must utilize to maintain our economy. Making artificial land would give us more land to farm and more land for the estates to control, which can kickstart our agricultural sector above the rest of Italy."
TUS_power_to_the_estates:0 "Power to the Estates"
TUS_power_to_the_estates_desc:0 "The estates are what makes us profits, workers may be important but with no estates, there would be no farms for us to profit off of. We must give the necessary power to the estates that allows them to work as efficiently as possible, which would only bring more into our pockets."
TUS_introduce_wage_labour:0 "Introduce Wage Labor"
TUS_introduce_wage_labour_desc:0 "According to Ridolfi’s plans, we will introduce wages for workers which will increase our worker’s productivity for a small cost. This will also reduce tensions when it comes to sharecropping, a small price to pay for the stability of our nation."
TUS_curtail_innovation:0 "Curtail Innovation"
TUS_curtail_innovation_desc:0 "Why fix what works? Making artificial land does not help us, the productivity of our workers does! The work they do, which has increased due to the wages we have given them, is enough for us to move forward. We must stomp out outrageous ideas of innovation, and stick to what works."
TUS_power_to_the_workers:0 "Power to the Workers"
TUS_power_to_the_workers_desc:0 "With the new reforms we have made, worker productivity is at its absolute height! Fields are being worked with a national drive and with much needed stability being brought within our lower-class populace. By giving power to the workers, we are getting more profits along with a more stable agricultural society."
TUS_continue_with_free_trade:0 "Continue with Free Trade"
TUS_continue_with_free_trade_desc:0 "The Grand Duke and his government have long been proponents of Free Trade. Exports are something we must utilize if we want to be a shining star in Italian economics. With artisan talents and a workforce with growing skill, we have the methods to create economic interests for other nations to invest in. Not only will our economy grow, but we will gain much needed trade relations as well."
TUS_protect_tuscan_production:0 "Protect Tuscan Production"
TUS_protect_tuscan_production_desc:0 "We must keep a firm hold on our products, our resources, and our economic independence. Depending on foreign trade could put us in an economic disaster and trade relations can threaten our isolation. We must stop the excessive exports, so we can put our own resources to our own use, which will be far more reliant than exports."
TUS_consumers_exist_not_in_the_countryside:0 "Consumers Exist not in the Countryside"
TUS_consumers_exist_not_in_the_countryside_desc:0 "If we are to make a real profit, we must accept the fact that our economy does not depend on our internal powers but more so from foreign buyers, regardless of our plans on trade, it is important that we maintain some level of trade."
TUS_but_outside_the_countryside:0 "But Outside the Country"
TUS_but_outside_the_countryside_desc:0 "In the words of a Livorian banker, the Tuscan market is too small compared to what it could be. We must put efforts towards expanding the market if we are to reach our economic peak. We must expand our reach through trade, which will help our economy run along smoothly."
TUS_the_expanding_grain_market:0 "The Expanding Grain Market"
TUS_the_expanding_grain_market_desc:0 "Grain has become a valued and more necessary resource that provides an opportunity for us to take advantage of. With increased harvests and our agricultural sector being expanded and improved upon, we can export grain to foreign powers with a guaranteed profit."
TUS_the_iron_industry:0 "The Iron Industry"
TUS_the_iron_industry_desc:0 " Iron is a resource that is growing in value which we have. We must dig deep and greedily, as with technology moving forward that utilizes iron, it will be important for us to be a step ahead, which benefits both sides of our trading policies. "
TUS_learn_from_leghorn:0 "Learn from Leghorn"
TUS_learn_from_leghorn_desc:0 "If Tuscany is to prosper, then we must learn from the ways of Livorno. The profits that were made from a free port city is something that we Tuscans should take advantage of, and it can benefit our intentions to increase the Tuscan market’s reach to Europeans. Just in the way of Livorno, we shall make our port cities hubs for trading profit."
TUS_modernisation:0 "Modernization"
TUS_modernisation_desc:0 "As we push economically, it is vital that we recognize the need for modernization, we must study foreign techniques, to replace our outdated techniques and equipment. This is needed so we can push Tuscany’s capabilities to their limit. "
TUS_not_industrialisation:0 "Not Industrialization"
TUS_not_industrialisation_desc:0 "It is being misunderstood that modernization is being taken as industrialization. Though it is simply not true. We must reaffirm that we are making the best out of agrarian technology, rather than resorting to industrial efforts for the sake of our economic stability."
TUS_social_concerns:0 "Social Concerns"
TUS_social_concerns_desc:0 "With the world changing, and Tuscany along with it, our social society has grown reasonably worried. We must address the concerns of the lower and upper class to help maintain our economic stability. Along with this, it can bring much needed trust back into the government from both sides. "
TUS_stability_for_workers:0 "Stability for Workers"
TUS_stability_for_workers_desc:0 "While there is debate on the priority of land owners and workers, it is also known that both are vital. We must provide stability for the lower class workers. After-all, without anyone to work the farms, there would be no harvest for us to profit off of. "
TUS_and_for_land_owners:0 "And for Land Owners"
TUS_and_for_land_owners_desc:0 "Land owners are a very important factor in our growing agricultural setting, without them, there would be no farms for us to profit off of and there would be no harvest as well. We must provide stability for them as well, as we push Tuscany to a golden age of agricultural modernization and improvement."

To obtain Austrian support, they were prepared to guarantee the status quo in Italy. Only Piedmont was in a position to disrupt it at that time, and Cavour negotiated an alliance with the Western powers. In May he sent to Crimea an army that performed brilliantly. As a result, Piedmont was able to assume a place among the victors at the Congress of Paris (February 1856). From this platform Cavour, achieving a diplomatic coup for Piedmont and Italy, declared that the only threat to peace in Italy, and the root cause of subversive plots, was the burdensome Austrian overlordship. Cavour’s pronouncements at the congress increased the standing of Piedmont among nationalists."

We will disguise the trip as a mere vacation to Switzerland while Count Cavour will travel on to Plombieres, where the French Emperor has agreed to meet with us. Together, the two leaders will plan an invasion of the Austrian-controlled part of our beautiful peninsula, and drive out foreign influence.

Since then the areas of Roquebrune-Menton have been under the Savoy administration to cease violence in the area.

sardinia.1.t:0 "The Crimean War"
sardinia.1.d:0 "Camillo di Cavour was under orders of Victor Emmanuel when 15,000 soldiers under the command of General Alfonso La Marmora landed in Russia. The intervention in the war was in a bid to gain recognition from major nations - France especially - to assist in the issue of Italian Unification. The bravery and courage of the soldiers who fought in the Battle of the Chernaya and the siege of the Sevastapol earned Sardinia a seat at the Peace Conference, and the dream of unification was becoming a reality."

sardinia.2.t:0 "Sardinian Diplomacy"
sardinia.2.d:0 "Sardinia-Piedmont the up-and-coming kingdom in Italy was, until recently, a lesser nation with little to no diplomatic power. Known only for it's failure to defeat the Austrians in the past, the entrance and performance of Sardinia in the Crimean War changed this completely. Now that the Sardinians hope to undertake steps towards unification, they have been insistent that Europe not forget their actions in this war."
sardinia.2.a:0 "They fought well"
sardinia.6.t:0 "Diplomacy with the British"
sardinia.6.d:0 "Diplomacy with the British rests largely in the friendship of Camillo Benso and the British Legation in Turin - James Hudson. James Hudson himself is quite the italophile, and his position in Turin - held since the days before Benso was prime minister - has convinced him of the need of support for the unification movement. Though he faces some ridicule at home for his position as a favorable ally of Camillo Benso, he will be a key instrument for Sardinia in the attempts to get British support for Unification."

sardinia.7.t:0 "Diplomacy with Sardinia"
sardinia.7.d:0 "James Hudson - the British Legation to Sardinia-Piedmont - has an equal number of allies in enemies in the British Government. The Queen herself is rumoured to claim he is too much a friend of the Italians than the British, but nobody in the government will tell you that he is a bad diplomat. Despite his friendship with Cavour and support for Italian unification, Hudson has always kept British interests in mind. Now that the Sardinians are looking for allies in their hopes for Unification communication between our nations is at an all time high. \n The most pressing matter for the Sardinians currently in which they hope to see our position in the case of the Cagliari - a Piedmontese mailing ship with two britons in the crew which was captured by the neapolitans. The Case is meant to go to parliament where Sardinian officials will make their plea and the fate of British and Sardinian relations will be decided. The date of the session is set for mid-1858."

The Cagliari ship was a Piedmontese Mailing ship captured by the Neapolitans with a crew that contained 2 britons. The British parliament has agreed to hear the case during the Spring of 1858. It will be here that Sardinian officials will finally be able to plead their case directly to the British Government.

Though most members of Parliament are skeptical that a ruling further than a denouncement of the actions of the Neapolitans is a smart move, James Hudson has managed to convince many that an alliance with the Sardinian state would be smart and beneficial.

sardinia.203.d:0 "The Treaty of Zurich signed between our nation, the French, and the Austrians is meant to finalize the agreements of the Villafranca peace we were absent from. Stipulating the return of the monarchs to the Central States, the treaty is seen unfavorably by the new La Mamora government and is not expected to be enforced in any meaningful way, at least not by ourselves."

sardinia.204.t:0 "The Status of the Central States"
sardinia.204.d:0 "Despite the Treaty of Zurich outlining the return of the Central States to their respective monarchs, the lands had already been under control of local governments allied to our cause since the outbreak of the Second Independence War. The French have not encouraged our enforcement of the treaty due to the lack of proper annexation of the Central States. This status quo has only been upset by great demands from the French that have even had other nations comment on their diplomatic strangling of our nation. \n\n The British have been adament that the French demands are "subversive of Italian independence.""

sardinia.205.d:0 "King Victor Emmanuel II, hopeful with the recent changes in the status quo of the Central States, has called on Cavour to return to the government and replace the lackluster government headed by La Mamora. It is expected that Cavour will begin new negociations with the French in preparation for a proper annexation of the Central States."

sardinia.208.d:0 "With the evidently Imminent collapse of the Bourbon Kingdom, much of the Apulin Bourbon garrison's have outright abandoned their posts, or been called to face the insurrectionist threat directly. In a desperate attempt to halt the advancing rebel forces, fearing chaos, looting, and rampant unrestricted crime, the Apulian locals have overthrown their local governorship in favor of unification with Sardinia, armed Apulian irregular militia’s have begun to establish a defensive front against the Bourbonists under the Sardinian banner."
sardinia.208.a:0 "Avanti Italia!"
sardinia.209.t:0 "Apulia Proclaims to Join Sardinia!"
sardinia.209.d:0 "With the evidently Imminent deterioration of our territorial integrity at the hands of the barbaric insurrectionists, much of our garrisoned forces have  abandoned their posts, or been called to the fronts in the midst of our valiant efforts at halting the advancing rebel forces. Fearing chaos, looting, and rampant unrestricted criminal activity, the Apulian locals have overthrown their local governorship in favor of unification with the Kingdom of Sardinia, and have begun mobilizing on our forces."

sardinia.210.t:0 "Reconstruction of Prismates in Alessandria"
sardinia.210.d:0 "Alessandria has long been a victim to the floods of the Tanaro. Luckily the parliament of Sardinia-Piedmont took note of the damage caused by the floods and passed a bill to reconstruct "prismates" to protect the fortifications of Alessandria against the floods of the Tanaro. The new bolstered defences will afford the ability to build safer in the city and provide security to those who had been effected."
sardinia.210.a:0 "Alessandria is safer now"
sardinia.211.t:0 "Annecy-Geneva Railroad"
sardinia.211.d:0 "Negociated in part by private companies and the respective parliaments of our nations, it has been determined that a railroad between Annecy and Geneva would benefit the Swiss and Savoy people greatly. Annecy is a hub for current trade between Switzerland and Sardinia-Piedmont, and so serves an important role in the economies of both cities. "
sardinia.211.a:0 "A Worthwhile investment"
sardinia.212.t:0 "U.S. Consular Relations Report"
sardinia.212.d:0 "In an act of mutual recognition, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia accepted the U.S. Consular Agent in Cagliari, François de Navoni, in 1802. The United States established full diplomatic relations with Piedmont-Sardinia on February 7, 1839, when the United States accepted the credentials of Count August Avogadro de Collobiano as the first Chargé d’Affaires in Washington D.C. from the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. The United States first established a legation to the Kingdom of Sardinia in Turin in 1840, the first U.S. Chargé d’Affaires to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia being Hezekiah Gold Rogers, who presented his credentials on September 15, 1840. Ever since this date, commercial and economic relations between our two states have become increasingly both controversial, and immensely profitable."

sardinia.213.t:0 "Commercial Assessment"
sardinia.213.d:0 "The United States has, as of recently, grown to become a vital partner in commerce for our kingdom. Ever since November 16, 1838, when US delegates met with King Carlo Alberto, Emanuele II’s father, our two states have enjoyed a cordia, mutually beneficial relationship. Shipments of cotton depart the southern states for Sardinian textile manufacturers, where they play a pivotal role as a prime material for the production of Piedmontese textile products. The textiles themselves are held amongst the highest regard in the consumerist economies of the northern states. The periodical Strengthening commercial ties with the United States overtime has left Sardinia in a state of near dependency on the lucrative cotton trade with the United States."
sardinia.213.a:0 "Intriguing..."
sardinia.214.t:0 "Strategic Assessment"
sardinia.214.d:0 "In June of 1848, Carlo Alberto granted the United States docking privileges in the port town of La Spezia after intense negotiations. The U.S. greatly values this arrangement, seeing the continuity of it’s usage as a U.S. docking bay and refueling station within the Mediterranean Sea as of utmost strategic importance. Many conservative politicians in parliament see the agreement as a breach of Sardinia-Piedmont’s national security, citing that the United States may use it’s preemptive advantage against us in the case of future conflict between our two states, and advocate for it’s immediate repeal. Withdrawing such a concession now would surely strain relations with the United States…"
sardinia.214.a:0 "This is a threat to our national security and an insult to our sovereignty! Repeal US docking permissions immediately!"
sardinia.214.b:0 "We have enough enemies as is, best not to cause trouble where it isn’t due."

Between 1815 and 1848, fewer and fewer Italians have been content to live under foreign rulers. Public outrage over foreign monopolies, standard of living, and political divide has reached an all time high. Most Italian nationalists look for leadership from the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, the most powerful and politically connected of the states, as well as the only Italian state with Italian native royalty. Sardinia has surged from the ashes of it’s first attempt at unification, and regained it’s respect in the Crimean war, to the majority within the Sardinian middle class, Sardinia-Piedmont holds the future of Italy in its hands."

A new legal system entered into force in Sardinia, and the last viceroy, Claudio Gabriele de Launay, left Cagliari on 4 March 1848. The island was divided into three provinces ruled by their prefects, following the system already used in Piedmont since 1815."

While the Centralization allowed for the stabilization of economic growth, improved national coherency, and eased difficulty for passing new legislations, it also left Sardinia being an even less significant overseas department of the Savoyard domains, angering many native Sardinian intellectuals. If left unchecked, tensions between Sardinia and the mainland could develop."

POLITICS_Camillo_Benso_di_Cavour_DESC:0 "Genevan by birth, his mother brought into the Cavour family the influence of Geneva, a city open to all the political, religious, and social movements of the period. The French Revolution imperilled the possessions of the Cavours because of their close ties with the Ancien Régime, but Camillo’s father reestablished the family in an eminent position in Napoleonic society, so all losses were compensated. As the younger son who could not hope for the economic and social position that would fall to his elder brother, Camillo saw a brilliant career open up before him under the protection of the court of Charles Albert, Prince of Savoy and Piedmont. \n\n His lack of enthusiasm for the court position and his open ridicule of the page-boy's uniform he was obliged to wear created controversy and confirmed the growing suspicions of rebellious intent within the young Camillo. He was influenced by the liberal ideas of the French writers Benjamin Constant and François Guizot, and his adversaries remained those of his childhood: paternalistic absolutism; legitimist reactionaries representing the landed interests, the aristocracy, and the clergy; and the union of throne and altar. His father got him appointed mayor of a village south of Turin and also became the administrator of extensive holdings in the vicinity belonging to his uncles. Social interests began to absorb him: the problems of poverty and prisoner education became the subjects of his research. In 1834, he wrote a memoir on poverty in Piedmont, which was published the following year in London in the Report from His Majesty's Commissioners for inquiring into the Administration and Practical Operation of the Poor Laws. A second pamphlet on the history of the Poor Laws in England was edited and published by Cavour in 1835 at Turin.\n\n His transition to politics was completed when King Charles Albert decided to embark on measures of reform and to concede a certain amount of freedom to the press. This prompted Cavour to offer his services as a volunteer until, on being elected a deputy in the Third Legislature, he began to fight for the approval of a peace treaty with Austria, although the extremists of the left wanted to continue a war that was, in effect, already lost. In October 1850, he was offered the post of Minister of Agriculture and soon became the most active and influential member of the Cabinet. The European drama into which Cavour was drawn against his will began in 1854 with the Crimean War, with the combined efforts of France, Great Britain, and Piedmont to secure the prosperity of the Ottoman Empire against the encroaching Russian Empire. \n\n Cavour advocates for a complete Anti-Austrian movement across the Piedmontese lands to fulfill Risorgimento and unite the Italian lands. Papal misgovernment in central Italy and the rough autocratic rule of the Bourbons in Southern Italy have guided Cavour into signing deals with the Major Powers to secure backing in the coming wars..."
