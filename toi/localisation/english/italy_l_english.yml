Italy cannot be truly reunified unless steps are taken to ensure freedom from the meddling Austrians. Luckily, Napoleon III of France shares with us a common enemy. We should send Count Cavour to meet with him, but none must know of this. We will disguise the trip as a mere vacation to Switzerland while Count Cavour will travel on to Plombieres, where the French Emperor has agreed to meet with us. Together, the two leaders will plan an invasion of the Austrian-controlled part of our beautiful peninsula, and drive out foreign influence.

TUS_the_tuscan_economy:0 "The Tuscan Economy"
TUS_the_tuscan_economy_desc:0 " If we are to become more than just a state to be dictated by foreign powers, we must develop an economy. Turning our focus here will benefit all of Tuscany."
TUS_the_sharecropping_debates:0 "The Sharecropping Debate"
TUS_the_sharecropping_debates_desc:0 "Due to our agrarian economy, it is obvious that sharecropping should be considered, seeing it’s success in the American south with its cotton industry. While a larger harvest would benefit us, this may upset the people as it will most definitely bring more of the poor into debt with landlords. This must be decided before we go any further with agriculture. "
TUS_textile_industry:0 "The Textile Industry"
TUS_textile_industry_desc:0 "The textile industry is something that many have made profits off of, especially in England. We would be foolish to not take advantage of its growth to further boost our economic ambitions."
TUS_the_artisans:0 "The Artisans"
TUS_the_artisans_desc:0 "Like much of the Italian peninsula, our economy is dominated by artisan-based industry. With our economy on the way to growing, it is pivotal that we make use of the artisans within our country. Their skill would be much needed in our workforce, and it will help increase our profits from exports with their talents utilized."
TUS_ridolfis_experiment:0 "Ridolfi's Experiment"
TUS_ridolfis_experiment_desc:0 "Ridolfi is a man that could bring the reform that Tuscany needs. If wages inspire our workers to work harder, perhaps it would be worth trying this. Productivity is what will keep us thriving, especially with our agrarian economy. However, a significant conflict has erupted between Ridolfi’s supporters and his critics. This may be too expensive, which might mean losing more money than we need to. This must be settled as we work on our agricultural sector."
TUS_reform_elsewhere:0 "Reform Elsewhere"
TUS_reform_elsewhere_desc:0 "Despite the promising aspects of Ridolfi's experimentation in the Agricultural sectors, our ministers have never been fond of changes the Tuscan economic outlook. We must look for a different solution, the workers are not the tools we need, though it is becoming clear that the estates might be the ones receiving more power, which will make us more popular with the upper class, the ones with actual power."
TUS_land_reclamation:0 "Maremma Reclaimations"
TUS_land_reclamation_desc:0 " Innovation is what we need and with our agrarian economy, it is a doctrine we must utilize to maintain our economy.

TUS_power_to_the_estates:0 "Power to the Estates"
TUS_power_to_the_estates_desc:0 "The estates are what makes us profits, workers may be important but with no estates, there would be no farms for us to profit off of.

TUS_continue_with_free_trade_desc:0 "The Grand Duke and his government have long been proponents of Free Trade. Exports are something we must utilize if we want to be a shining star in Italian economics.

# Tuscan Events
tuscany.1.t:0 "The Grand Duchy of Tuscany"
tuscany.1.d:0 "The Grand Duchy of Tuscany has long been ruled by the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, interrupted only during Napoleon's conquest of Italy. During the revolutions of 1848 the Grand Duke Leopold II embraced liberalism and our soldiers fought side by side with those from Sardinia, The Papal States, and the Kingdom of Naples. Overthrown by popular revolt still, Leopold could only return to rule Tuscany with the assistance of Austria, whose garrison only left in 1855. With the liberal constitution revoked the politics of the Duchy are stagnant. An incompetant ruling class rules over the land of Tuscany. As Sardinia-Piedmont is beginning to suggest Italian Unity our people become restless. Will the traditions of our Duchy lead us to dust, or will we embrace the republican spirit of our people?"
tuscany.1.a:0 "It is a trying time"
tuscany.2.t:0 "The Tuscan Economy"
tuscany.2.d:0 "The Tuscan Economy is almost entirely agrarian. The largest export from our nation is grain. Despite the agrarian occupation that many of our citizens hold, there is a growing artisan industry as the need for manufacturing increases. Rails in the Duchy are in the midst of an upgrade as work with the Austrian rail companies assists the connections we make between our capital and the port city of Livorno. Livorno is the home of trade and industry for Tuscany. Textiles and Iron flow from the port as the base for our economy. However, a battle is brewing between land owners and peasants, and bosses and workers."
tuscany.2.a:0 "More Problems to Solve"
tuscany.3.t:0 "The Sharecropping Debate"
tuscany.3.d:0 "Feudalism has never really left Tuscany. The Sharecroppers, mezzadros, has a compact with the landowner to cultivate land and share profits from sales in return for housing, seeds, and other minor goods. The merits of this system are being called into question by our politicians, especially the liberal ones. More and more farmers are demanding the rights to own their own land."
tuscany.3.a:0 "The future of mezzadria is in question"
tuscany.4.t:0 "The Ridolfi Experiment"
tuscany.4.d:0 "Cosimo Ridofli operates a fine winery in Tuscany. As the issues with sharecropping influence many land owners, Ridolfi has proposed possibly introducing wage labour on a wider scale in Tuscany. Wage labour is something usually reserved to those who work with the artisans or other part of the economy. There is disagreement if introducing wage labour to agriculture could solve our issues or make them worse."
tuscany.4.a:0 "We must introduce wage labour"
tuscany.4.b:0 "Our reforms must be elsewhere"
tuscany.5.t:0 "The Political Scene"
tuscany.5.d:0 "Leopold II is not a very popular leader. His dynasty is propped up by Austria and their empire influences our nation a great deal. One condition of his return was the removal of the constitution, something the liberal politicians seek to have returned. There are minor legislative powers in the government but much power is centralized. As rumors that Sardinia-Piedmont will make its attempt to unify Italy soon are spreading, so is discontent and shadow organizations."
tuscany.5.a:0 "The future is unknown"
tuscany.6.t:0 "Memories of 1848"
tuscany.6.d:0 "Following the revolutions of 1848 the Grand Duchy of Tuscany joined the Sardinian coalition in the fight against Austria. Our troops eventually pulled out along with those of the Two Sicilies and Papal States, and our people revolted against Duke Leopold II. The Austrian Empire eventually put down the revolt and reinstated Leopold, at the cost of removing the constitution granted after the revolutions. The people do not have fond memories of the events that unfolded."
tuscany.6.a:0 "An unfortunate legacy"
tuscany.7.t:0 "Liberalism in Tuscany"
tuscany.7.d:0 "Though not present today, Tuscany has a long history of liberal elements. It was the original Senate of the Forty-Eight that eventually allowed the Medici family to create the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In Tuscany today liberalism is all but criminalized. Liberal politicians work in secret organizations away from the public eye. With Austrian influence in the nation, many wonder if a radical approach is necessary just as it was in 1848. There are a wealth of secret radical societies and exiled politicians that would be ready to assist a new uprising. On the other hand, if Leopold II came out in support of a constitutional monarchy, it could diminish the chance that Austria attempts to interfere in our nation's politics again."
tuscany.7.a:0 "Radicalism is our only hope"
tuscany.7.b:0 "Republicanism is our only chance"
tuscany.8.t:0 "Tuscan National Society"
tuscany.8.d:0 "Italian National Societies exist across the peninsula. Most prominent are the societies in Piedmont and Lombardy. Originally founded by the supporters of Mazzini, these societies support the unification of Italy through a variety of means. In Tuscany the national societies have been forced underground. Allowing these societies to return to a more public scene will further support for liberalizing Tuscany."

tuscany.9.d:0 "Drastic changes is the political climate of the nation have reignited debates over the economy of Tuscany. Though the estates and nobles have lost much of their power, sharecropping is not a system that will be removed from Tuscany quickly. Many question if it is time for our nation to finally adopt the Industrial Revolution completely. At the same time, the rest of Europe is removing their farmland and replacing it with factories. Demands for Tuscan grain are higher than ever and clearing land for factories will hamper our ability to meet the needs of nations looking to import our grain. However, a choice must be made."

Grand Duke Leopold II originally desired to have the line pass through Siena, extending the Florence-Siena line. Bettino Ricaosoli and many other favored extending the Arezzo line. With the completion of both the Siena and Arezzo lines, a decision must be made regarding the path to Perugia."

tuscany.11.t:0 "The Constitutional Monarchy"
tuscany.11.d:0 "It is no secret that Leopold II harbors some support for the liberal movements within Italy. In a bold move against the Austrian Empire Leopold II has allowed the transition towards a Constitutional Monarchy to begin. Giovanni Baldasseroni, prime minister under Leopold II, has been given a temporary increase in power as the office of the Prime Minister will take over as head of government. Leopold II will remain as head of state and though his political power is certainly weakened, his dynasty has secured a place in Tuscan politics."
tuscany.11.a:0 "This was a necessary step to take"
tuscany.12.t:0 "Return of the Constitution"
tuscany.12.d:0 "It has been a long time now that Tuscany has lacked a proper constitution. After the first constitution was forcibly removed by the Austrian Empire many doubted that such a thing could return to Tuscany. Against all odds, however, our people have triumphed and the Constitution has returned. This time around, Austria will not be able to force her will on us."

Grand Duke Leopold II has proceeded over the elections and is preparing to announce the victor. It is no secret that he may have influenced the outcome but it has not taken away from the joy of the people."

tuscany.15.t:0 "Italian Revolutionaries in Parma and Modena"
tuscany.15.d:0 "The Duchies of Parma and Modena were forced into the Austro-Sardinian war for the same connections to Austria that once held our nation down. Just like our people refused to fight in favor of Austria, the people of Parma and Modena have formed revolutionary councils with temporary power granted to liberal politicians. These regions are now prepared to join with any cause hoping to unite Italy."

tuscany.16.t:0 "Diplomacy with Sardinia-Piedmont"
tuscany.16.d:0 "With our ambitions to unify the peninsula known, the time has come to open diplomacy with Sardinia-Piedmont. Many in our government hope that an agreement can be reached that will avoid conflict. Sardinia-Piedmont employs an army that may be difficult to defeat, despite the large number of Italians who now support our efforts. If an agreement is to be reached, it will surely be costly."

tuscany.17.d:0 "[TUS.GetLeader] is meeting with [PIE.GetLeader] today to discuss the possibility of unifying our governments. Though an extreme measure, both of our governments have expressed desire to see the Italian Peninsula unified. Unfortunate for our position is the fact that Tuscany has embraced a much more liberalized goverment and outlook than we employ. The people of Italy have become split and fear of revolutionaries joining Tuscany have become very real. The best offer we can accept is to gaurentee that our politicians have solidified positions in the new government."

tuscany.18.t:0 "The Costly Agreement"
tuscany.18.d:0 "Coming as somewhat of a surprise the government of Sardinia-Piedmont has agreed to unite our governments, requiring only that politicians from Turin are given special positions. While the agreement will tarnish our reputation and introduce possible corruption into our government, it is a great leap into building the legitimacy of our nation and claims."
tuscany.18.a:0 "Unification is Near"
tuscany.19.t:0 "Hostilities Break Out!"
tuscany.19.d:0 "Sardinia-Piedmont was unwilling to attempt to unify our governments, even at the suggestion of placing their politicians in key positions. With no agreement in sight, it did not take long for a state of war to be declared. Sardinia-Piedmont claims that our government is illegitimate and violates agreements made following the Second Independence war, while our claim rests upon our representation of all Italians and the greater liberal unification movement."
tuscany.19.a:0 "War is Among Us"
tuscany.20.t:0 "Garibaldi Joins our Cause"
tuscany.20.d:0 "Giuseppe Garibaldi, hero of the Italian People, has arrived to pledge his support for our movement. All too aware of the elitist present in Turin, Gariabldi was eager to join our attempts to create a truly liberalized Italy. The presence of Garibaldi has increased moral among the people greatly and has given us much legitimacy in the eyes of Italians."
tuscany.20.a:0 "Our Victory is certainly Secured!"
tuscany.21.t:0 "Supporting Democracy in Tuscany"
tuscany.21.d:0 "As our influence in the Central States continues to grow, the question has arisen as to how much support we should dedicate to Tuscan democracy. The people of Tuscany are very supportive of liberalization but many radicals persist to challenge our ideal for unification. Some fear that should we strengthen Tuscan democracy too much, their own radical movement may rise to challenge our hopes for unification."
tuscany.21.a:0 "We cannot risk intervention"
tuscany.21.b:0 "We must weaken Austria's sphere"
tuscany.22.t:0 "A Leader for the Movement"
tuscany.22.d:0 "Many prominent figures have risen to the loose leadership circles of the secret societies and radical groups in Tuscany. As the time is approaching for our movement to rise up against the Duke, a leader must be singled out. Many point to Ricasoli - A prominent liberal politician and someone who could represent the hidden agenda of our revolutionary council without making our members' ideology known. Others call on Niccolò Tommaseo who has been in Tuscany since 1857. Tommaseo held important positions in the Republic of San Marco during the revolutions of 1848 and has held firm against Sardinia-Piedmont becoming a power in Italy."
tuscany.22.a:0 "Tommaseo shall lead once again"
tuscany.22.b:0 "The people trust Ricasoli already"
tuscany.23.t:0 "Revolutionary Spirit"
tuscany.23.d:0 "There is a certain spirit around Tuscany as of late. The feeling of revolution is in the air as both radicals and liberals join forces in preparing to launch a revolution against the Duke and his oppressive regime. Italians across the peninsula who have been made aware of the plan, through our network of secret societies and opperatives, are flocking into Tuscany in order to join in the fight for true liberty in Italy."
tuscany.23.a:0 "First we liberate Tuscany, then the whole of Italy"
tuscany.24.t:0 "Subverting Austrian Influence"
tuscany.24.d:0 "Despite most of their garrisons having left, the Austrian still exert a level of influence over the politics of our nation. The Austrians may be willing to invade once again should our goals be made clear to them too quickly. We must play a dangerous game of politics in order to keep the Austrian eyes away from our activites. As soon as we can convince them to have their garrisons leave the country entirely, we will have more room to expand operations."
tuscany.24.a:0 "They must think nothing is amiss..."
tuscany.25.t:0 "Tuscan Radicals Request Arms"
tuscany.25.d:0 "The Radical movement in Tuscany has requested that we supply them with arms. It is no secret that we would benefit from a weaker Austrian sphere of influence in Italy and supporting the Tuscan movement to break away from the Pro-Austrian Duke Leopold II would help to weaken the Austrian grip on the Italian peninsula."
tuscany.25.a:0 "Supply them with Arms"
tuscany.25.b:0 "We cannot support them"
tuscany.28.t:0 "[FROM.GetDef] Declines Assistance"
tuscany.28.d:0 "Our request for assistance has been decline by [FROM.GetDef]. Perhaps they were unwilling to risk any diplomatic issues that could have arisen or maybe they just didn't care to support our movement. Hopefully we can make do without their help."
tuscany.28.a:0 "Unfortunate"
tuscany.29.t:0 "The French Accept our Request!"
tuscany.29.d:0 "The French have accepted our request for arms. Their government is just as eager as we are to see Austrian influence in the Italian peninsula weakened. There is no doubt they may have other motives for supporting us but we cannot be concerned with those now. These arms will help our fight."
tuscany.29.a:0 "Merci France!"
tuscany.26.t:0 "Tuscan Radicals request Goods"
tuscany.26.d:0 "The radical movement in Tuscany has requested that we supply them with goods. It is no secret that after their betrayal in the Crimean War we have not had strong relations with the Austrians. It may be time to have the Austrians weakened in their sphere of influence."
tuscany.26.a:0 "Supply them with Goods"
tuscany.26.b:0 "We cannot support them"
tuscany.30.t:0 "The Russians Accept our Request"
tuscany.30.d:0 "Though somewhat surprising, the Russians have agreed to supply us with some goods in order to assist in our fight against Austria and her puppet government in Tuscany. The Austrian Empire betrayed Russia in the Crimean War and it is clear that Russia has not forgiven them yet."
tuscany.30.a:0 "These will help our men"
tuscany.27.t:0 "Tuscan Radicals Request Supplies"
tuscany.27.d:0 "The Radical movement inside Tuscany has requested that we send supplies to assist them in their revolution against Duke Leopold II and furthermore Austria should they intervene to support the Duke. Though we have stayed somewhat neutral in Italy in the past, our politicians have shown interest in helping the people of Central Italy who have been caught between the desires of Sardinia-Piedmont and Austria."
tuscany.27.a:0 "Set up a Supply Chain"
tuscany.27.b:0 "We cannot help them"
tuscany.31.t:0 "The British Send Supplies"
tuscany.31.d:0 "Due to support for our cause within the British parliament, the British have accepted our request for supplies. The Tuscan economy is not built to sustain war, let alone to supply a war effort, so these supplies will assist not only our troops but also our civilian industry in ensuring our economy does not collapse."
tuscany.31.a:0 "Thank our friends in parliament!"
tuscany.32.t:0 "Tuscans Request Withdrawal of our Garrison"
tuscany.32.d:0 "Ever since the Revolutions of 1848/, in which the Grand Duchy of Tuscany turned it's forces against us, we have maintained a modest garrison in the city of Florence to deter further revolutionary action. Leopold II eventually came around to accept our demands, which included a removal of the Tuscan Constitution, and our influence has been strong there ever since. Recently, however, the people of Tuscany have grown discontent with our influence being exerted over them. We have received a request from the Grand Duke himself that our garrisons expedite their exit from Tuscany so that a transition of power from the Duke towards a parliament and prime minister may occur unheeded.\n\n Many of our politicians claim that with the current European attitude in Italy not being in our favor, trying to intervene could come at an extreme cost. We also run the risk of Sardinia-Piedmont and her allies taking advantage of the situation to capture what Italian lands we do still hold."
tuscany.32.a:0 "We have no choice but to comply"
tuscany.33.t:0 "Austrian Garrison Withdrawn!"
tuscany.33.d:0 "The Austrian Empire has agreed to withdraw the rest of their garrison from Florence, likely due to international favor turning away from them and fear of Sardinia-Piedmont and her allies taking advantage of the situation. Now that the garrison is gone the transition of power from Duke Leopold II towards the Prime Minister and parliament can begin. Citizens in Florence celebrated throughout the night, this time without the Austrians watching."

The most worrisome is the English hostility towards us. They seem to have forgotten the close friendship the house of Bourbon shared with them during the war against Napoleon.

Fearing a larger riot, General Nunziante commanded the 13th Hunters Battalion to open fire on the Swiss soldiers.

 sardinia.9.d:0 "A number of events promoted Piedmont’s prestige in Italy and abroad. In March 1854 France and England intervened in support of the Ottoman Empire against Russia in the Crimean War. To obtain Austrian support, they were prepared to guarantee the status quo in Italy. Only Piedmont was in a position to disrupt it at that time, and Cavour negotiated an alliance with the Western powers. In May he sent to Crimea an army that performed brilliantly. As a result, Piedmont was able to assume a place among the victors at the Congress of Paris (February 1856). From this platform Cavour, achieving a diplomatic coup for Piedmont and Italy, declared that the only threat to peace in Italy, and the root cause of subversive plots, was the burdensome Austrian overlordship. Cavour’s pronouncements at the congress increased the standing of Piedmont among nationalists."

monaco.1.d:0 "Following the Congress of Vienna, Monaco was trasnferred to the Kingdom of Sardinia as a protectorate. The Treaty of Stupinigi in 1817 formalized the relationship between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Protectorate of Monaco. The treaty was overall devastating for Monaco and much of the wealth of the nation was lost, which was further inflamed when a majority of the nation declared independence during the Revolutions of 1848. Since then the areas of Roquebrune-Menton have been under the Savoy administration to cease violence in the area. As the struggle for unification is underway, many question what status Monaco will play in it. Shall Monaco be transferred to France along with Savoy and Nice in exchange for French support, or should we fight to ensure Monaco remains apart of the Italian sphere?"

sardinia.1.d:0 "Camillo di Cavour was under orders of Victor Emmanuel when 15,000 soldiers under the command of General Alfonso La Marmora landed in Russia. The intervention in the war was in a bid to gain recognition from major nations - France especially - to assist in the issue of Italian Unification. The bravery and courage of the soldiers who fought in the Battle of the Chernaya and the siege of the Sevastapol earned Sardinia a seat at the Peace Conference, and the dream of unification was becoming a reality."

sardinia.2.t:0 "Sardinian Diplomacy"
sardinia.2.d:0 "Sardinia-Piedmont, the up-and-coming kingdom in Italy was, until recently, a lesser nation with little to no diplomatic power. Known only for it's failure to defeat the Austrians in the past, the entrance and performance of Sardinia in the Crimean War changed this completely. Now that the Sardinians hope to undertake steps towards unification, they have been insistent that Europe not forget their actions in this war."

sardinia.6.d:0 "Diplomacy with the British rests largely in the friendship of Camillo Benso and the British Legation in Turin - James Hudson. James Hudson himself is quite the italophile, and his position in Turin - held since the days before Benso was prime minister - has convinced him of the need of support for the unification movement. Though he faces some ridicule at home for his position as a favorable ally of Camillo Benso, he will be a key instrument for Sardinia in the attempts to get British support for Unification."

The Queen herself is rumoured to claim he is too much a friend of the Italians than the British, but nobody in the government will tell you that he is a bad diplomat. Despite his friendship with Cavour and support for Italian unification, Hudson has always kept British interests in mind. Now that the Sardinians are looking for allies in their hopes for Unification communication between our nations is at an all time high. \n The most pressing matter for the Sardinians currently in which they hope to see our position in the case of the Cagliari - a Piedmontese mailing ship with two britons in the crew which was captured by the neapolitans. The Case is meant to go to parliament where Sardinian officials will make their plea and the fate of British and Sardinian relations will be decided. The date of the session is set for mid-1858."

sardinia.99.d:0 "The Political structure of Italy, should the war against Austria go well, is something that might cause some fracturing in the alliance. With the ultimate French goal to regain influence in the peninsula lost in the Congress of Vienna - through the means of an Italian Confederation, and the goal of Piedmont being creating at least a northern Italian Kingdom. Hopes of Piedmont for complete unification are not to be ignored, however."

sardinia.100.d:0 "As the French prepare to lay out their plan for the Italian Peninsula, we must begin to think about whether the confederation is something that we should go along with. Naturally, we can always give the French our assurances now and see if the future allows us to change the agreement, but we are not in a good position to deny the French goal of domination in Italy. With that we are stuck in this position, with the hope to escape at first chance or at the very least to renegociate the terms of the confederation."

This would see Austria entirely removed from the Italian peninsula, and the creation of a new powerful Independent Italian state."

sardinia.102.d:0 "Central Italy would be reorganized under the rule of Roberto I, Duke of Parma. Roberto, being an adolescent, currently entrusts state legislation with Louise Marie Thérèse d'Artois as acting regent. France clearly believes that Lousie d’Artois may be more akin to following a policy of clienthood with the French Empire due to her francophone upbringing. This new Central Italian Kingdom would be awarded with the former Duchy of Tuscany, as well as the Marche and Umbrian former Papal Legislations. The Pope in compensation, would be nominated honourary head of the confederation, not that the Papacy has much of a choice."

However, it is unclear whether or not the Bourbon rulers would be open to the idea of confederation, should they be unable to be convinced of the merits of Neapolitan integration into the proposed confederation, it is almost assured that the Two Sicilies would be awarded to a Bonapartist relative of Napoleon III."

As the dominant power in Europe compared to the Italians it would be more appropriate for us to lead the armies in Italy, however, the Italians are very nationalistic people and the presence of strong Italian leaders could pay off to rally the populace and inspire troops.

Some claim that the French have plans to ensure that Sardinia-Piedmont stops Garibaldi before he is able to get to Rome, but these stories have not been confirmed. It is clear now that the people of Italy are nearly victorious in their cause and unification is close."

Though initially succesful, Bixio and many of the officers of the Expedition were prepared to retreat when Garibaldi himself rode to the front of the columns declaring that "Italians, here we must die!"

Rumors of the victory, and that the men of the expedition were supernatural forces, inspired the citizens of Partinico to prepare an ambush for the advancing Bourbon amry. Once in the town center the soldiers were fired upon by citizens. The soldiers managed to respond by burning down over 60 houses, robbing many, and killing some women and children. However, the Bourbon army was already weakened and refused to be stuck in the town, retreating and leaving the wounded. \n\n When Garibaldi arrived in the town he found the citizens had brutally murdered the wounded soldiers left behind. Some were killed in brutal ritualistic killings and tossed on fires of the buildings. One woman, when questioned why the bodies were not buried, responded that "They do not deserve burial; dogs must eat them." "

The four hundred gendarmes ordered to garrison the capital city of Potenza at first appeared to yield to the imposing popular manifestation, but directly afterwards, at the cry of "Long live the King! and Death to the Nation!" set up by Captain Castagna, they fought futilely against the insurrectionist forces, but were repulsed and fled, leaving seven dead, three wounded, and fifteen prisoners to the rebel Lucanians. Those who were dispersed surrendered, one after the other."

According to witness accounts from Naples, the Neapolitan minister of war announced the following morning that he was departing for Calabria to defeat Garibaldi and retake Reggio, but then changed his mind that same afternoon due to considerations of his presence in the capital being essential to prevent disorder."

Since it’s foundation, it’s raised a large sum of funds through a multitude of fundraisers, planned events, and won over the support of a multitude of Publishers. Now, with the dominant support of the middle class, the National Society has begun a wildly popular propaganda campaign in advocation for the unification of Piedmont and Lombardy, and even as far as the expulsion of Austrian influence over Italy."

 PIE_Spearheading_The_Risorgimento_desc:0 "While nationalism destroys empires, it also builds nations. Italy will be one of the countries to form from the territory of crumbling empires. Between 1815 and 1848, fewer and fewer Italians have been content to live under foreign rulers. Public outrage over foreign monopolies, standard of living, and political divide has reached an all time high. Most Italian nationalists look for leadership from the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, the most powerful and politically connected of the states, as well as the only Italian state with Italian native royalty. Sardinia has surged from the ashes of it’s first attempt at unification, and regained it’s respect in the Crimean war, to the majority within the Sardinian middle class, Sardinia-Piedmont holds the future of Italy in its hands."
 PIE_Perfect_Fusion:0 "Perfect Fusion"
 PIE_Perfect_Fusion_desc:0 "In 1847, a segment of the Sardinian elites from Cagliari and Sassari, led by the unionist Giovanni Siotto Pintor, demanded the so-called Perfect Fusion, making it so that Sardinia could get the liberal reforms that were not available for the island because of its separate legal system. A new legal system entered into force in Sardinia, and the last viceroy, Claudio Gabriele de Launay, left Cagliari on 4 March 1848. The island was divided into three provinces ruled by their prefects, following the system already used in Piedmont since 1815."

 PIE_Sardinian_Question_desc:0 "Sardinians lost their former powers of taxation and autonomous representation in exchange for the Piedmontese parliament taking over legislative responsibility on the island, and some seats in the Congress following the so-called ‘Perfect Fusion’. While the Centralization allowed for the stabilization of economic growth, improved national coherency, and eased difficulty for passing new legislations, it also left Sardinia being an even less significant overseas department of the Savoyard domains, angering many native Sardinian intellectuals. If left unchecked, tensions between Sardinia and the mainland could develop."

And while this is partially true, the existing industry is primarily Artisan-based, producing consumer products such as clothing, food, processed foods, and other vanities. This limits the production capacity for state necessities, such as the production of arms, rations, and military equipment."

Many factors can be attributed to the rapid rise in fertility rates, including recent  innovations in the fields of agricultural methodology, advancements in medicine, and direct government incitement for population growth. As of current, the birth-rate across the peninsula averages at about five children per mother, an astoundingly high value even in comparison with our neighbours."

POLITICS_Camillo_Benso_di_Cavour_DESC:0 "Genevan by birth, his mother brought into the Cavour family the influence of Geneva, a city open to all the political, religious, and social movements of the period. The French Revolution imperilled the possessions of the Cavours because of their close ties with the Ancien Régime, but Camillo's father reestablished the family in an eminent position in Napoleonic society. As the younger son who could not hope for the economic and social position that would fall to his elder brother, Camillo saw a brilliant career open up before him under the protection of the court of Charles Albert, Prince of Savoy. \n\n His lack of enthusiasm for the court position and his open ridicule of the page-boy's uniform he was obliged to wear created controversy and confirmed the growing suspicions of rebellious intent within the young Camillo. He was influenced by the liberal ideas of the French writers Benjamin Constant and François Guizot, and his adversaries remained those of his childhood: paternalistic absolutism; legitimist reactionaries representing the landed interests, the aristocracy, and the clergy; and the union of throne and altar. His father got him appointed mayor of a village south of Turin. Social interests began to absorb him; the problems of poverty and prisoner education became the subjects of his research. In 1834, he wrote a memoir on poverty in Piedmont, which was published the following year in London in the 'Report from His Majesty's Commissioners for Inquiring into the Administration and Practical Operation of the Poor Laws.' A second pamphlet on the history of the Poor Laws in England was edited and published by Cavour in 1835 in Turin.\n\n His transition to politics was completed when King Charles Albert decided to embark on measures of reform and to concede a certain amount of freedom to the press. This prompted Cavour to offer his services as a volunteer until, on being elected a deputy in the Third Legislature, he began to fight for the approval of a peace treaty with Austria, although the extremists of the left wanted to continue a war that was, in effect, already lost. In October 1850, he was offered the post of Minister of Agriculture and soon became the most active and influential member of the Cabinet. The European drama into which Cavour was drawn against his will began in 1854 with the Crimean War, with the combined efforts of France, Great Britain, and Piedmont to secure the prosperity of the Ottoman Empire against the encroaching Russian Empire.\n\n Cavour advocates a complete anti-Austrian movement across the Piedmontese lands to fulfill the Risorgimento and unite the Italian lands, a promise he is willing to keep."
