Both emigrants and revolutionaries from Bulgaria itself responded to his appeal. By June 1862, between 80 and 95 and according to some accounts up to 600 volunteers were gathered in Belgrade. The detachment was given the name "Legion" in early June 1862, when it took part in the armed clashes with the Turks at Varoš kapija and Vidin kapija in Belgrade. Subsequently, it defended a section of the Serbian positions in the city, and some of the Bulgarian volunteers were sent to Kragujevac, led by Ilyo Markov. However, the failure of the Hadjistavreva Buna interrupted plans for an uprising in Bulgaria. Theft of the funds raised and unsuccessful negotiations for funding from the Bulgarian communities in Braila and Vienna left the legion with very few weapons and forced it to go on Serbian state maintenance at the end of August."

After the last Ottoman garrisons were withdrawn in 1867, Serbia was faced with multiple currencies in circulation. Thus, the prince Mihailo Obrenović ordered a national currency to be minted.

Into this crowd came a quarrel, and the water tank of a Turkish soldier was broken. Then an angry Turkish soldier smashed the head of a Serbian boy, Sava Petrovic, with a prod and beat him to death. Nearby Serbs and Turks, as well as several Serbian gendarmes, immediately arrived at the scene. Turkish soldiers tried to escape, but the Gendarmeries detained them and called the police chief Mihajlo Barlovac. Barlovac sent several more policemen to the scene along with the interpreter Simo Nesic. The Turkish soldiers involved in the incident were afraid that the civilians who arrived at the scene would beat them. They were taken to the Serbian police under guard, and the wounded apprentice was sent home. While passing by their barracks, i.e. Turkish police buildings, the Turkish soldiers tried to escape, but were stopped by Sima Nesic and Gendarme George Nishli. Turkish soldiers then fired from the barracks, killing Simo Nesic and mortally wounding George Nisli. Others then fired…."

Immediately after the shooting, a general alarm was raised in Belgrade. The Turks barricaded themselves in all four city gates, in taverns and mosques. The Serbs, in turn, set out to arm themselves and occupy the Turkish gates. The Turkish Pasha then dispatched a strong force from the fortress and sent it to the Turkish barracks. Apparently, they were to attack the Serbian police and the charshiya. Prime Minister Ilija Garashanin detected the unit and since there were armed saints around, he persuaded them to return, guaranteeing their safe return. Along with them, he sent some Serbian Gendarmeries. However, there was a commotion in the city itself and the people were outraged by the Turks, and besides, the saint was encouraged by Joka Vlajkovic. On the return of the Turkish unit, someone in the crowd killed a Turkish officer, a company commander. Then the Turkish soldiers shot and killed several Serbs. "

After capturing the three gates, the Turks remained comforted in the Stambol Gate. Nikola Christo ordered the Varosh Gate and the Sawa Gate to be razed to the ground overnight. Tekiyas and mosques were also captured, some by negotiation. Many Turks attempted to capture the Belgrade fortresses with their families in turmoil.

    SER_politics.210.d: "At night foreign consuls came and intervened. British Consul Longworth mediated between the Pasha of Belgrade and Ilija Garasanin, so that on 16 June an agreement was reached for the Turkish soldiers to leave Belgrade and move into the fortress, and on the other hand to ensure the security of Turkish property in the city. However, an even greater crisis occurred and the ceasefire was broken on Tuesday, June, when the Turks began a several-hour bombardment of Belgrade with a cannon march after the solemn funeral of the dead. On this occasion the roof of the Metropolitan Church, the bell tower of the Cathedral and the Captain Mishino building were damaged. The Italian Consulate "Serbian Crown", where the French Consul was living at the time, was also affected. Later the city government found that as many as 396 houses had been hit and that fifty Serbs had been killed. Most of the consuls, except the Austrian, sided with the Serbs, believing that they gave no grounds for bombing. The Serbian Government used this event to demand the expulsion of the Turks from Serbia, but at a conference of the guaranteeing powers in the Constantinople suburb of Kalanca, held in July, it was decided to expel only Turkish civilians and to retain the Turkish urban garrisons. They remained for the next five years."

On the 30th of November, 1858 in Belgrade, the Saint Andrews Assembly was convened. After the Members had been seated, the Secretaries took their places in the upper part of the Chamber, under the Chair tables. At the same time, three priest-deputies consecrated the hall. Shortly thereafter the members of the Council, led by Tom Vucic Perisic, entered the assembly. Knyaz Alexander came accompanied by ministers and his retinue. The Knyaz addressed the assembly with "God help me, Lord", and the assembly responded with "God help you, Lord". The knyaz then announces to the congregation that his leader will read her the prepared sermon. The sermon was read by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ljubomir Petrovich. After reading the sermon, the knyaz declared the assembly open, and withdrew, accompanied by ministers and the world. The Assembly decided that the Prince should resign. A letter was written to the knyaz in which the Assembly, on behalf of the people, asked the Prince to resign the dignity of Prince of Serbia and to hand over his power to the National Assembly. ". . . The National Assembly hopes," the letter reads, "that your Majesty will respect this voice of your people, and for the love of the happiness, peace and tranquillity of our and your fatherland, will voluntarily renounce the Government, so that in 1842 . The National Assembly has handed over the government to you, so that you, the Holy Prince, may return it to the Assembly and through it to the people... "Together with this letter was enclosed the resignation which the Prince was to sign, and both acts were taken to court by a deputation of the Assembly headed by him. The Prince accepted the deputation and asked to come tomorrow morning after his resignation. That evening, however, the knyaz , accompanied by Ilija Garashanin, left for the city of Belgrade, and the assembly, without waiting for his written resignation, excluded him by one decision from the princely dignity. That's the first time in 16 years, the political order changes with strong opposition againt Karadjordjevic."

For the next two years, Sava Grujić organized more major reforms in the army, improving her fighting capacity and giving her a new organization, Grujić realized that it was necessary to stiffen the back of the Serbian militia, so he split the standing army, which had seen little action during the first war, into smaller units that acted as cadres for the larger units of the militia. The troops were led by capable Serbian officers who proved their heroism and tactical ability. In 1876 King Milan had kept the standing army out of combat, fearing to commit the troops he saw primarily as protection for his dynasty, but Grujić reorganization turned it into the backbone of a considerably improved Serbian fighting force."
