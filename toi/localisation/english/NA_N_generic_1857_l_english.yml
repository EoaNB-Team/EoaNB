  ### Nez Perce War ###
 
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.1.t: "Revise the Walla Walla Treaty of 1855?"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.1.d: "After the Orofino Creek Gold Rush, settlers flocked the Nez Perce reservation in search of riches. Due to the inability of the Federal government to stop the flocking of settlers, [NEZ.GetName] defended it's territory outlined by the Walla Walla Treaty of 1855. As a consequence of neglecting the settlement crises conflicts are regular.\n\nA proposition has been made to federalize 90% of the [NEZ.GetAdjective] Reservation in an attempt to better regulate the creation of settlements. It's an attempt to maximize resource exploitation and minimize settler/native conflicts.\n\nThe only issue is with the [NEZ.GetName], who find this proposal to be highly controversial. The tribes are split between accepting and rejecting this proposal, but they don't have much leverage in our negotiation. They have again and again asked us to uphold the territories outlined by the Walla Walla Treaty of 1850 and to remove unlawful settlements. Though this would certainly remove our access to the rich gold mines of the [1074.GetName] Reservation.\n\nWith that in mind, one question remains... What shall we do?"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.1.a: "Revising the treaty to federalize gold mines will better regulate settlements."

 NA_N_nez_perce_war.2.d: "After the Orofino Creek Gold Rush, settlers flocked the Nez Perce reservation in search of riches. Due to the inability of the Federal government to stop the flocking of settlers, [NEZ.GetName] defended it's territory outlined by the Walla Walla Treaty of 1855. As a consequence of the United States neglecting the settlement crises, conflicts became a regular occurrence.\n\nA proposition has been made to federalize 90% of the [NEZ.GetAdjective] Reservation in an attempt to better regulate the creation of settlements. It's an attempt to maximize resource exploitation and minimize settler/native conflicts.\n\nMany people throughout the [NEZ.GetName] find this proposal to be highly controversial. Our tribe is split between accepting and rejecting this proposal, but we don't have much leverage in our negotiation. Chief Hallalhotsoot, the Lawyer Chief, negotiated the original Walla Walla Treaty of 1855. He has navigated politics to give us the best possible deal before, and has manged to secure a small portion of our original territory to stay as our own. The Lawyer Chief states that military conflict with the United States is futile, that it is best to diplomatically secure our existance.\n\nThough not all are agree with the Lawyer Chief's outlook. Some, such as Chief Joseph, resent this treaty and reject it entirely. The aftermath of this treat has divided the tribe between those who will go and those who will stay and fight."
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.2.a: "The Lawyer Chief did what he could, but we are not capitulating our land."

Unfortunately not all share the wise insight of the Lawyer Chief, that resistance is futile, and are dead set on rejecting the treaty. Those individuals have been declared enemies of the state for not adhering to the new treaty."

 NA_N_nez_perce_war.5.d: "Settlers called a council in May and ordered the non-treaty bands to move to the reservation. The Nez Perce stress that they need enough time to move their livestock to the reservation, but settlers demand they leave within 30 days. A discussion with the non-treaty bands is expected to take place shortly. But before this meeting takes place, what should our stance be on this matter?"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.5.a: "Thirty Days! They've had years to leave before today!"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.5.b: "A year would be a realistic timeframe, but we may anger settlers..."
 
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.6.t: "The Settler Ultimatum to Nez Perce"
 NA_N_nez_perce_war.6.desc_1: "General Oliver Otis Howard called a council in May and ordered the non-treaty bands to move to the reservation, setting an impossible deadline of 30 days. Howard humiliated the Nez Perce by jailing their old leader, Toohoolhoolzote, who spoke against moving to the reservation. The other Nez Perce leaders, including Chief Joseph, considered military resistance to be futile; they agreed to the move and reported as ordered to Fort Lapwai, Idaho Territory.\n\nOne of the major concerns of the leaders was that they have sufficient time to prepare to leave and to move their livestock. They wanted to wait until autumn as a minimum, or ideally, a year. Toohoolhoolzote also expressed the natives' reluctance to sell their land, which went against their religious beliefs. The military, on the other hand, demanded that they be moved in 30 days, or the soldiers would use force. General Oliver O. Howard put this to them strongly, after Toohoolhoolzote began to speak on the sacredness of the Earth to his people:\n'I do not want to hear you say anything more like that. I am telling you! Thirty days you have to get on the reservation.'\n'You ask me to talk, then tell me to say no more,' Toohoolhoolzote replied. 'I am chief! I ask no man to come and tell me anything what I must do. I am chief here!'\nGeneral Howard answered sharp. 'Yes, you are chief. I am telling you! Thirty days you have to move in... I am the man to tell you what you must do! You will come on the reservation within time I tell you. If not, soldiers will put you there or shoot you down!'\n\nToohoolhoolzote stood up to General Howard, and told him he would not obey. Yellow Wolf reported the final words:\nChief Toohoolhoolzote did not become afraid. His words were strong as he replied, 'I hear you! I have simiakia, that which belongs to a man! I am a man, and will not go! I will not leave my home, the land where I grew up!'\n\nFor this he was jailed..."

 ### Colorado War ###
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.1.t: "Revise the Treaty of Fort Laramie?"
 NA_N_colorado_war.1.d: "By the terms of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie between the United States and various tribes including the Cheyenne and Arapaho, the Cheyenne and Arapaho were recognized to hold a vast territory encompassing the lands between the North Platte River and Arkansas River and eastward from the Rocky Mountains to western Kansas. However, the discovery of gold within the Rocky Mountains brought on a gold rush and a consequent flood of white emigration across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands.\n\nColorado territorial officials are pressuring federal authorities to redefine the extent of Indians treaty lands. This task, if accepted, would be up to A.B. Greenwood, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who will arrive at Bent's New Fort along the Arkansas River to negotiate a new treaty."
 NA_N_colorado_war.1.a: "Send the chiefs gifts, that will persuade them to sign..."
 NA_N_colorado_war.1.b: "Decline the revision, we will maintain the current treaty."
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.2.t: "The Treaty of Fort Wise"
 NA_N_colorado_war.2.d: "Six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States, at Bent's New Fort at Big Timbers, recently leased by the U.S. Government and renamed Fort Wise, in which they ceded to the United States most of the lands designated to them by the Fort Laramie treaty. The Cheyenne chiefs were Black Kettle, White Antelope, Lean Bear, Little Wolf, Tall Bear, and Left Hand; the Arapaho chiefs were Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, and Big Mouth.\n\nMany Cheyenne claim the signature is illegitimate due to it not being made with a consensus of all tribe members. Though these resisters shall be marked as hostile and assumed to be planning for war."
 NA_N_colorado_war.2.a: "Well, a signature is a signature!"
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.3.t: "The Treaty of Fort Wise"
 NA_N_colorado_war.3.d: "Six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States, at Bent's New Fort at Big Timbers, recently leased by the U.S. Government and renamed Fort Wise, in which they ceded to the United States most of the lands designated to them by the Fort Laramie treaty. The Cheyenne chiefs were Black Kettle, White Antelope, Lean Bear, Little Wolf, Tall Bear, and Left Hand; the Arapaho chiefs were Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, and Big Mouth.\n\nThe new reserve, less than one-thirteenth the size of the 1851 reserve, was located in eastern Colorado along the Arkansas River between the northern boundary of New Mexico and Sand Creek. Many Cheyennes are opposed to the treaty. That it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe, that the signatories had not understood what they signed, and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts. The whites, however, claimed the treaty was a 'solemn obligation' and considered that those Indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war."
 NA_N_colorado_war.3.a: "We shall ignore this illegitimate treaty!"
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.5.t: "Reports of Stolen Cattle and Attacks"
 NA_N_colorado_war.5.d: "Colonel John Chivington, commander of the Colorado volunteers, reports that Cheyenne Indians have stolen 175 heads of cattle from our settlers."
 NA_N_colorado_war.5.a: "Let him investigate, we must protect our settlements!"
 NA_N_colorado_war.5.b: "Tell Colonel Chivington he's needed more on the front lines."
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.6.t: "Razing of the Cheyenne Encampment"
 NA_N_colorado_war.6.d: "Lt. George Eayre, under the command of Colonel John M. Chivington, despatched a force to recover the stolen cattle. Eayre then encountered a band of Cheyenne, which a fight then ensued and a Colorado soldier was killed. In retaliation, Eayre burned seventy tipis of a nearby Cheyenne encampment and returned to Denver with only 20 of the reported 175 heads of stolen cattle.\n\nThough the Cheyennes contest our reports, claiming they found the cattle wandering freely on the plains. Thus it was free to take the cattle into their encampments. Who do we believe?"
 NA_N_colorado_war.6.a: "How could we believe the Cheyenne? They've been raiding villages lately..."
 NA_N_colorado_war.6.b: "We shall relocate Colonel John M. Chivington to a different post at once."
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.7.t: "Slaughter of the Cheyenne Encampment"
 NA_N_colorado_war.7.d: "Lt. George Eayre, under the command of Colonel John M. Chivington, despatched a force to recover the stolen cattle. Eayre then encountered a band of Cheyenne, which a fight then ensued and a Colorado soldier was killed. In retaliation, Eayre burned seventy tipis of a nearby Cheyenne encampment and returned to Denver with only 20 of the reported 175 heads of stolen cattle.\n\nWe obviously contested this report upon the altercation, that these cattle where wandering freely on the plains. Thus it was free to take the cattle into their encampments, but they did not believe us and the argument escalated to self-defense when the soldier proceeded to take our cattle without our consent."
 NA_N_colorado_war.7.a: "How hollow is a man to raze everything... over claimed cattle?"
 
 NA_N_colorado_war.9.t: "Chivington's Cheyenne War"
 NA_N_colorado_war.9.d: "Lt. Eayre was in the field again with 100 men and 2 howitzers. Near the Smoky Hill River in Kansas, Eayre had a battle with the Dog Soldiers. He claimed the Indians started the battle; the Indians claimed the soldiers attacked them. Eayre claimed that he killed 28 Indians at a loss of four men of his own. George Bent claimed that only three Indians were killed, but among the Indian dead was Lean Bear, a prominent Dog Soldier leader. Eayre finished his raid on an encampment near Fort Larned, where 240 of his horses and mules were stolen by the Kiowa. Arapahoes offering assistance to recover the stolen horses were fired on by Colorado soldiers and thereafter turned hostile.\n\nThe Cheyenne report a different story. Less than 15 months after meeting President Lincoln in Washington, Lean Bear, Black Kettle, and others in the tribe were camping on their buffalo hunting grounds near Ash Creek. The 1st Colorado Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant George Eayre, approached the group. Positive that this would be a peaceful encounter, Lean Bear went alone to meet the militia to show his peaceful intentions. On his chest, Lean Bear proudly wore his peace medal that he had received on his trip to Washington D.C. in 1863. In his hand, he held an official document signed by Lincoln stating that he was peaceful and friendly with whites. What Lean Bear did not realize was that Eayre's troops were operating under orders from Colonel John M. Chivington to 'kill Cheyennes whenever and wherever found.' Eayre ordered his men to shoot Lean Bear, who was wounded and fell off his horse. He was then shot repeatedly by the soldiers as they rode past his body on the ground..."

Our architects have drawn up plans for a metropolis that will represent our new aesthetic of 'Native Gothic' and showcase our new technical advancements to the watching world. This city will be built around a central circus 2km in diameter, within which will be contained the world's largest totem pole and area of worship, a colossal offering to our gods and ancestors, and an incredible monument to our power and wealth. The only question that remains, is whether we should rename the city or keep the old one?"

nativepolitical.6.d:0 "There was a flash, as the bomb went off on the range. It was a new guidance system they were testing, some kind of gyroscope. The shamans in their white coats and overalls stood shoulder to shoulder with generals and chiefs. One evening, long ago, an elderly Cherokee Brave told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people. He said, 'My son, there is a battle between two wolves inside us all.  One is evil.  It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt,resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other wolf is good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.' The grandson thought abut it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, 'Which wolf wins?' The old Cherokee simply replied, 'The one you feed.' There was a low drone as the test plane zipped overhead, and a crackle on the radio of the pilot asking for his next orders. The general gave the go-ahead and moments later the second bomb touched down on the range. There was a crack, and then a flash."

nativepolitical.7.d:0 "The chief is dead. I suppose with all our medical technology, we forgot that we were simply human.

On one side, the effective and efficient but autocratic Annette Taipa Gibson, and on the other the slightly corrupt and certainly profiteering millionare philathropist Adam Wolf's Head."

nativemilitary.3.t: "The Wendigo Battalion"
nativemilitary.3.d:0 "A wendigo, is an evil spirit which originates from the darkest folklore of this land. The Wendigo is often said to be a malevolent spirit, sometimes depicted as a creature with human-like characteristics, which possesses human beings. It is known to invoke feelings of insatiable greed/hunger in men, the desire to cannibalize other humans, as well as the propensity to commit murder in those that fall under its influence. The Wendigo is gaunt to the point of emaciation, its desiccated skin pulled tightly over its bones. With its bones pushing out against its skin, its complexion the ash-gray of death, and its eyes pushed back deep into their sockets, the Wendigo looks like a skeleton recently disinterred from the grave. What lips it has are tattered and bloody ... Unclean and suffering from decay of the flesh, and it gives off a strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition, of death and corruption. This terrible creature stalks in the night, capturing an consuming it's prey, and is truly a figure to be feared. But it's just a myth, right? The truth is, stranger than fiction. These 'wendigo' are not mythical ravenous man-eating monsters, but men, dressed all in black, who hunt in the night. A battalion of soldiers specially trained in the mastery of night-fighting and hunting, and sworn to fight for their people until the very bitter end. These stalkers can track american troops for days, weeks even, calculating their number and understanding their behavior by what they leave behind. They can pull men from their tends, sabotage stores, release horses to run, and cause untold chaos behind enemy lines. Truly, the most feared monster here is in fact man."

TAIPA_GIBSON_DESC: "Many thought the previous chief was ruthless in his treatment of the Americans, with very few giving any thought to who was feeding him ideas. Annette Taipa Gibson was the reigning crown-princess of terror during the eviction of the USA, and stands ready to show the world that they ain't seen nothing yet. Don't worry, she doesn't bite...much."
WOLFS_HEAD_DESC:0 "Adam Wolf's Head is a very popular man. Former president of the board of shareholders at Sioux Telegraphy, he's a millionare philathropist, businessman, race-car driver, and many other things including the owner of the world's greasiest moustache. He's also slightly corrupt and highly profiteering, with a copy of Atlas Shrugged instead of morals."
