#Country Leader Descriptions
DEN_CARL_CHRISTOFFER_GEORG_ANDRAE_LEADER_DESC:0 "Carl Christopher Georg Andræ is the President of Denmark and the leader of the Cabinet of Andræ. From 1842 until 1854, he was a professor of mathematics and mechanics at the national military college. During his tenure as professor, he was royally appointed as a member of the 1848 Danish Constituent Assembly, and six years later, became Finance Minister in the Cabinet of Bang. He was appointed President of Denmark in 1856 but although he was trying to appease both the left and the right, his reign unfortunately hasn't been one of peace and calm, as tensions continue to rise in Schleswig and Holstein even after the conclusion of the First Schleswig War. Due to the tiring political turf war, his days as president seem numbered, as it's become semi-public knowledge within cabinet that he's considering retiring from his position."
DEN_CARL_CHRISTIAN_HALL_LEADER_DESC:0 "Carl Christian Hall is a Danish national liberal statesman. He had a distinguished tenure at school and college, after which he became a professor of law. His first steps in politics was when Hall had taken office in the Bang administration on the 12th of December 1854. He's since grown quite a reputation as a politician and, as of now, he has been appointed President of Denmark. With rising tensions around the Schleswig-Holstein question, Hall has been a strong supporter of the Ejderpolitikken policy, which aims to restore Denmark's historic southern border on the Eider river, which runs between Schleswig and Holstein. Hall shares this belief with most of the national liberals, who aim to tie the Duchy of Schleswig more firmly to Denmark, even if it means confrontation with the German Confederation."
DEN_CHRISTIAN_EMIL_FRIJS_LEADER_DESC:0 "Christian Emil Frijs is a Danish politician that is currently the President of Denmark, heading the Frijs Cabinet. He graduated from Sorø Academy in 1835, going on to study law. He is the wealthiest large squire of Denmark and is honored by his peasants. He is part of the Højre, also known as the Conservative Party and is actively against the National Liberals.
