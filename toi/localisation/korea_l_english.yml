 KOR_sedoregime:0 "The Sedo Regime"
 KOR_sedoregime_desc:0 "The era of great rulers like Sejong and Taejo is no more. Our country has been taken advantage of by powerful yangban clans that exert their influence all throughout our system of government, including our king. This is a dark time for the Kingdom of Joseon."
 KOR_sociocrisis:0 "Socioeconomic Crisis"
 KOR_sociocrisis_desc:0 "Our Kingdom has been hard hit by a number of cascading problems, both natural and systematic, that have all but crippled our nation’s capability to flourish. Severe droughts and major crop failures, plus inefficient and even abusive administration of our bureaucracy by the Yangban have led to widespread hunger and high levels of resentment against the ruling classes. " 
 KOR_distanceclans:0 "Distance from the Clans"
 KOR_distanceclans_desc:0 "Submitting to the Andong Kims already growing influence over the royal court has proven to be a fool’s errand, leading to untold levels of corruption within our highest government institutions. Measures must now be made to reassert the power of the Yi line, no matter how rocky that path may be." 
 KOR_approachkim:0 "Approach Kim Rivals"
 KOR_approachkim_desc:0 "Although the greatest problem of Joseon’s administration lies with the power of the clan structure over the royalty, the Yi family does not wield enough influence of its own to shake off Andong Kim rule. Secretly approaching powerful rivals to the Kim like the Pungyang Cho may be King Cheoljong’s only choice." 
 KOR_offerpositions:0 "Offer up Government Positions"
 KOR_offerpositions_desc:0 "In order to sweeten the deal with the Cho, the King must be willing to offer up high positions of power within his Uijeongbu and other portions of the Three Administrations."
 KOR_courtclanleaders:0 "Court Clan Leaders"
 KOR_courtclanleaders_desc:0 "The message must get out to other powerful clan leaders to form a coalition with the Yi clan to begin to chip away at Andong Kim influence. In order for these messages to be convincing, certain “gifts” may need to be attached..."
 KOR_supportrivalschools:0 "Support Rival Schools"
 KOR_supportrivalschools_desc:0 "One of the greatest weapons the Kim rivals have are the seowon, influential Confucian institutions that leave an impact on the thinking of our scholarly class. If the King can give extra financial and material support to these institutions, it will greatly undermine Kim popularity amongst their peers."
 KOR_formcoalition:0 "Form a Coalition"
 KOR_formcoalition_desc:0 "Now that King Cheoljong has been able to convince an appreciable amount of disparate anti-Kim factions, efforts must now be made to unite these clans together under a royal coalition with the goal of cleansing our government of the Kims."
 KOR_encouragedisputes:0 "Encourage Doctrinal Disputes"
 KOR_encouragedisputes_desc:0 "The correct interpretation of Zhu Xi’s writings has been an issue in Korean clan politics for decades. If the King can add more fuel to this fire, it will prevent many of the royal clans from banding together and threatening the Yi like the Andong Kim before them."
 KOR_ignitefaction:0 "Re-ignite Factionalism"
 KOR_ignitefaction_desc:0 "Now that a significant amount of Kim influence has been swept from the royal government, King Cheoljong has been given a unique opportunity to restore balance between the competing royal clans so as to increase his own power. Encouraging in-fighting between these different clans will distract them from grabbing at more royal positions."
 KOR_supportrivals:0 "Support Local Kim Rivals"
 KOR_supportrivals_desc:0 "Though the Andong Kim clan has lost a fair amount of influence within the royal court, they still are one of the strongest royal clans in the Kingdom of Joseon. Their power can be checked further by supporting Yangban administrators of different clans in local institutions."
 KOR_restorecheckbalance:0 "Restore the Checks and Balances"
 KOR_restorecheckbalance_desc:0 "Like the Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo before him, King Cheoljong now has the capability to restore the fragile checks and balances of competing royal clan powers within the Joseon governmental hierarchy. The restoration of this “Tangpyeongchaek” policy will greatly increase the power of the Yi ruling family."
 KOR_submitclans:0 "Submit to the Clans"
 KOR_submitclans_desc:0 "Although taking such a path would likely place the power of clans like the Andong Kims ascendant over the Yi royal family, supporting the Kims will likely be able to bring about a measure of stability to our disordered domain."
 KOR_complykims:0 "Comply with the Andong Kim Clan"
 KOR_complykims_desc:0 "In order to further the stabilization of our realm under one royal clan, the Kims of Andong have asked our King Cheoljong to accept members of the Kim dynasty into the Uijeongbu and other high ranking positions according to the recommendations of Queen Cheorin."
 KOR_curbcho:0 "Curb Pungyang Cho Influence"
 KOR_curbcho_desc:0 "Now that the Kim clan has obtained control over vast portions of the royal government, efforts can be begun to crack down on rival clans who threaten the stability of our realm. The Pungyang Cho clan is the most dangerous of these, as they were able to wrest power temporarily from the Kims earlier in the century."
 KOR_quellrivals:0 "Quell Rival Factions"
 KOR_quellrivals_desc:0 "Although efforts have been made to curb Pungyang Cho clansmen from high power positions, many smaller rival clans still control positions of influence in our nation’s seowon and other institutions, spreading lies about supposed Kim corruption. This must cease."
 KOR_onedoctrine:0 "One Confucian Doctrine"
 KOR_onedoctrine_desc:0 "A major instigator of factionalism within our domain is the petty disputes over how certain Neo-Confucian doctrines should be interpreted. If we are not to end up like the Sarim before us, we should support hand-picked scholars who interpret Confucian doctrine in a way that supports Kim rule. "
 KOR_oneclan:0 "One Clan Dominance"
 KOR_oneclan_desc:0 "Now that most of our rivals have been beaten down a peg and religious disputes have been quieted, the Kim clan at last has an opportunity to take control over nearly all branches of royal and local administration without much contest."

 KOR_foldtemples:0 "Fold the Buddhist Temples"
 KOR_foldtemples_desc:0 "Many of our current troubles root from those greedy Buddhists who huddle in their temples and charge high rates on our people. Forcing some of these institutions to close and liquidating their assets will surely help expand the royal coffers."
 KOR_sangmintax:0 "Raise Sangmin Taxes"
 KOR_sangmintax_desc:0 "For the greater good of Korea, more taxes should be levied on the Sangmin peasant class to be used for further economic projects. They may grumble a bit more if we did this, but time and numerous revolts have proven that the poor can never be satisfied anyway."
 KOR_stabilizecrisis:0 "Stabilize the Crisis"
 KOR_stabilizecrisis_desc:0 "With new means of cash flow to the royal coffers attained, efforts may now be focused toward shoring up our Kingdom and bringing about some degree of order in the midst of the economic chaos rippling throughout the country."
 KOR_teachingschoe:0 "Teachings of Choe Je-U"
 KOR_teachingschoe_desc:0 "A new movement has been founded by the name of Donghak, or “Eastern Learning.” This ideology, being a mixture of Confucianism with elements from Buddhism, shamanism, and even Catholicism, will greatly shape the fate of our Kingdom."
 KOR_denouncedong:0 "Denounce Donghak as Heresy"
 KOR_denouncedong_desc:0 "The radical views of Choe Je-U’s Donghak presents a clear and present danger to the already fragile social order of Korea. Allowing such egalitarian views of society to spread into the minds of angry and uneducated peasants will only increase their vitriol and contempt for true Confucian doctrine."
 KOR_persecutedong:0 "Persecute Donghak Adherents"
 KOR_persecutedong_desc:0 "In order to protect the orthodoxy of Neo-Confucian ideology, we must purge ourselves of all followers of Choe Je-U immediately."
 KOR_uniteconfucian:0 "Unite under Confucian Orthodoxy"
 KOR_uniteconfucian_desc:0 "The spread of such radical religious views like Donghak must never happen again. Efforts must be made to support our established state religion of Confucianism to tie all Koreans together under a bond of religious unity."
 KOR_recognizechoe:0 "Recognize Choe's Philosophy"
 KOR_recognizechoe_desc:0 "Although his teachings are unusual, Choe Je-U’s radical views on philosophy and the social hierarchy may be just the thing Joseon needs to bring about lasting reform. Recognizing such a controversial figure will likely not bode well with a majority of the Korean people, however…" 
 KOR_aidchoe:0 "Aid Distribution of Choe's Works"
 KOR_aidchoe_desc:0 "With Choe Je-U protected by the royal government, the time has come to begin to popularize his viewpoints among the established order. Granting more funding for him to codify his ideas and distribute them among the general populace will surely help it spread much quicker."
 KOR_religiousdong:0 "Donghak Religious Communities"
 KOR_religiousdong_desc:0 "New communities of Donghak adherents have begun to slowly pop up all across our Kingdom. Composed mainly of disaffected peasants seeking an escape from their dismal existence, supporting these communities will only increase Donghak’s popularity amongst the masses."
 KOR_newfollowers:0 "New Followers"
 KOR_newfollowers_desc:0 "Donghak’s teachings have begun to capture the hearts and minds of many of the Sangmin peasant class, offering to elevate them from a deplorable state of tenant farming and virtual slavery to near-equality with their Yangban overlords."
 KOR_spreaddong:0 "Spread of Donghak Teachings"
 KOR_spreaddong_desc:0 "It cannot be denied that Choe Je-U’s teachings have struck a chord from within the peasant class. Already thousands have subscribed to his ideas in some shape or form, however in true peasant fashion they may seek to incite violence and disorder if local officials do not bend to their demands in time."
 KOR_pushreform:0 "The Push for Popular Reform"
 KOR_pushreform_desc:0 "Thousands of angry peasants, aroused by the social egalitarian teachings of Donghak, have marched up to administrators demanding major reforms in the system of land distribution and ownership rights. Time must be taken to consider their demands."
 KOR_landreform:0 "Institutional Land Reform"
 KOR_landreform_desc:0 "By reforming the old system of land distribution, the trend for Yangban officials taking over greater plots of land from poor farmers with little resistance can be reversed. Such a change will greatly reduce the amount of rioting we will get from disaffected peasants."
 KOR_farmerrights:0 "Rights for Tenant Farmers"
 KOR_farmerrights_desc:0 "Although land reform was only a step in the right direction, we now have the opportunity to finally bring Choe’s teachings into real practice in Korea by offering greater freedoms for tenant farmers working under Yangban planters by calling all landowners to treat their hired hands fairly and on a more semi-equal plane."
 KOR_traditionszhu:0 "Traditions of Zhu Xi"
 KOR_traditionszhu_desc:0 "Zhu Xi, the founder of what is now known as Neo-Confucianism, has played a pivotal role in shaping the political and religious order of Joseon Korea. Furthering support of his teachings among all corners of our society will certainly benefit royal authority and legitimacy."
 KOR_supportsilhak:0 "Support Silhak"
 KOR_supportsilhak_desc:0 "Silhak began as a movement to embrace aspects of Western philosophy and religion, as well as taking a more practical rather than metaphysical look at Neo-Confucian principles. It dates itself all of the way back to the late 17th century, and it produced great scholars such as Tasan and Yi Ik. To follow in those great philosophers’ stead will surely be of great benefit to Joseon, though it may anger the more conservative members of our government…"
 KOR_promotesilhak:0 "Promote Silhak Scholarship"
 KOR_promotesilhak_desc:0 "In order to get Silhak ideas into the mainstream philosophical discourse, funding written works by Silhak scholars and promoting their teachings in local seowon will be required. It may take several years for these scholars to begin to make headway with their teachings."
 KOR_asianenlightenment:0 "An Asian Enlightenment"
 KOR_asianenlightenment_desc:0 "It is a new era for Silhak philosophy. Now that most mainstream scholars have acquiesced to the fact that taking a practical view of Confucian principles will help our Kingdom in its current weakened state, scholars have already begun to research new scientific methods to improve our understanding of the world."
 KOR_harmonizelearning:0 "Harmonize East-West Learning"
 KOR_harmonizelearning_desc:0 "Although our native traditions are the best and most fit for our people, integrating facets of Western scientific practices, philosophical ideas, and religious concepts will only further enhance our great Korean culture, with the side benefit of making a more palatable deal for the conservative Confucianists.
 KOR_practicallearning:0 "Practical Learning"
 KOR_practicallearning_desc:0 "Through our scholar’s research into important Western scientific tomes such as the works of Matteo Ricci, we now have been granted the opportunity to put these teachings to practice by improving our scientific research and developing new methods and designs to improve overall productivity and efficiency."
 KOR_pragmaticreforms:0 "Pragmatic Reforms"
 KOR_pragmaticreforms_desc:0 "One of the fundamental principles of the Silhak movement is to use a strong knowledge base to bring about the greatest practical good for our society. Now that our scholars have proven themselves to be capable researchers and inventors, they now call upon the royalty to grant their request to reform inefficient practices in our economic system and to introduce new methods in their stead."
 KOR_embracewest:0 "Embrace Western Philosophy"
 KOR_embracewest_desc:0 "The time has come to take a radical step in a new direction for Joseon. The sophistication of the Western powers in terms of their technology and their philosophical practices are the envy of the world, and it would be prudent of the Korean people to follow in a similar path. Adopting the Western mindset will surely anger conservative officials, but it may turn out to be the change Korea needs."
 KOR_invitejesuit:0 "Invite Jesuit Scholarship"
 KOR_invitejesuit_desc:0 "With tolerance for Western ideas growing in our Kingdom, the time has come to begin to acknowledge the usefulness of the Catholic missionaries that have been visiting our realm. Such men, though they may breed instability among our people, are surely men of great wisdom and scientific insight, and are worthy of being utilized as advisors in our court."
 KOR_toleratecatholics:0 "Tolerate the Catholics"
 KOR_toleratecatholics_desc:0 "With Jesuit scholars now placed in our confidence, the time has come to consider whether to grant further toleration to all of those who call upon the Jesuits’ God. Such a move will surely please the West, but will leave a deep divide among our people."
 KOR_westerninnovation:0 "Western Innovations"
 KOR_westerninnovation_desc:0 "With a greater tolerance for Western ideas now realized in our Kingdom, further patronage of Silhak scholars will allow them to contact more Western scholarship in China and therefore bring back more ideas that our people can benefit from."
 KOR_koreanconfucianism:0 "A Korean Confucianism"
 KOR_koreanconfucianism_desc:0 "Though the original teachings of Zhu Xi were of a Chinese origin, our scholars, through their great ingenuity and wisdom, have begun to shape those original teachings into a set of religious and cultural practices that are distinctly our own. Promoting this will only increase the unity of our people under one set of fundamental ideals."
 KOR_confucianseowon:0 "Confucian Seowon"
 KOR_confucianseowon_desc:0 "Seowon, private educational institutions that also serve as Confucian shrines, are a distinct part of our Korean culture. Through the seowon comes our greatest scholar-officials and the renowned Seonbi philosophers. Supporting these institutions will help our scholars develop new cultural and even scientific discoveries."
 KOR_metaphysicalstudies:0 "Metaphysical Studies"
 KOR_metaphysicalstudies_desc:0 "Neo-Confucian philosophy and doctrine requires years of study among our best scholars to even begin to fathom a small portion of its teachings. Patronizing more scholars to study the less understood parts of Confucian metaphysics will go a long way in codifying a more unified doctrine and producing more capable philosophers."
 KOR_deforestation:0 "Deforestation"
 KOR_deforestation_desc:0 "In order to combat the effects of the famine, plans must be made to begin to clear out certain forested regions in order to make room for more farms and logging camps. Although this move will surely damage our environment, such a move is sadly necessary if we are to continue our national recovery. "
 KOR_yangbanplant:0 "Yangban Plantations"

 KOR_ginsengcult:0 "Ginseng Cultivation"
 KOR_ginsengcult_desc:0 "Ginseng is known for its popularity both in Korea and in China for its healing properties. Chinese traders would surely be happy to purchase more of our ginseng if we were to produce them in greater quantities."

 KOR_cottonfarm_desc:0 "The construction of new cotton plantations will allow us to bring more goods to market."
 KOR_peasantirrigation:0 "Peasant Irrigation"
 KOR_peasantirrigation_desc:0 "With the expansion of our agriculture comes the need to expand viable waterways to water our new crops with.

 KOR_northenmining:0 "Northern Mineral Mining"
 KOR_northenmining_desc:0 "Thanks to our efforts up north, our miners have begun to make new discoveries in the form of new coal deposits. More funding to this operation should allow us to extract a bit of those resources for our use."
 KOR_seearmy:0 "See to Army"
 KOR_seearmy_desc:0 "It has been the longstanding policy of Joseon to all but neglect the maintenance of its army, due to the belief that the scholarly life is more preferable to the soldiering one. If we are ever to reverse this policy, new efforts must be made to secure more funding for the army and increase its numbers."
 KOR_armyreform:0 "Begin Army Reform"
 KOR_armyreform_desc:0 "For too long, the corruption of Yangban aristocrats have plagued the proper functioning of our army. Now that our government has re-asserted its proper authority, the time has come to clear out this corruption and fundamentally rebuild the Korean Army. "
 KOR_yangbanstaff:0 "Clear out Yangban Staff"

 KOR_recruitofficers_desc:0 "With major command positions within our army now emptied of corrupt aristocrats, the time has come to seek out up and coming commanders who may be worthy enough to lead the armies of our King into battle. "
 KOR_recruitment:0 "Recruitment Effort"
 KOR_recruitment_desc:0 "An army is nothing without a decent amount of manpower backing it up, and right now we are lacking in it. The call for more troops must be sent out. "
 KOR_improvenavy:0 "Improve Joseon Navy"
 KOR_improvenavy_desc:0 "For too long, our navy has been all but neglected by our government, and it is a far cry from the formidable navy we once had under the great Yi Sun-Shin. If we are to elevate our naval force beyond just a pitiful little coastal defense force, new efforts must be made to build more dockyards and training more seamen. "
 KOR_centralports:0 "Central Korean Ports"

 KOR_southports:0 "South Korean Ports"

 KOR_largevessel:0 "Large Vessel Plans"
 KOR_largevessel_desc:0 "We must build a navy that will be feared by our neighbors just as they feared us during the Imjin War. Constructing larger and stronger vessels will cost us more, but there will be no greater demonstration of Korean naval might. "

 KOR_remainiso:0 "Remain Isolationist"

 KOR_opendoor:0 "Open Korea's Doors"
 KOR_opendoor_desc:0 "We must no longer close off our country to the world around us. Although stepping out into the brave unknown is a dramatic step that will cause much alarm amongst our populace, Korea must open trade on its own terms now while it still has the chance. "

 KOR_frenchencroachment:0 "French Encroachments"
 KOR_frenchencroachment_desc:0 "It is clear that the French are not to be trusted. Their priests come to us with a false air of peace and try to convince us to join with the Western devils, but we know better. "

 KOR_fortifyganghwa:0 "Fortify Gangwha Island"
 KOR_fortifyganghwa_desc:0 "It is apparent that our fortifications along the banks of Ganghwa Island and our capital are insufficient if faced with a much larger Western attack.

 KOR_producemyeonje:0 "Produce Myeonjebaegab"
 KOR_producemyeonje_desc:0 "Myeonje baegab, an ingenious new design of armor composed of 13 to 30 folds of fabric covering the upper torso, is reportedly one of the world’s first truly bullet-proof armor, capable of stopping a modest amount of bullets of the caliber used by most Western firearms. Supporting the production of these armor pieces will greatly increase our soldiers’ survivability in the field. "
 KOR_koreadefiant:0 "Korea Defiant"
 KOR_koreadefiant_desc:0 "Through all they have suffered through, the Korean people endure, willing to risk life and limb to defend the values which are uniquely their own. Separated from Westernization or colonial influence, Korea now firmly walks down a path it may call its own. "
 KOR_unlikelyalliance:0 "An Unlikely Alliance"

 KOR_portprotection:0 "Ports for Protection"
 KOR_portprotection_desc:0 "In order to further our cooperation with our French counterparts, we must be willing to open up a few of our ports to their trade and to sign a few treaties allowing French citizens to be given a preferred status in our country. It’s not ideal, but at least the French will be guaranteeing our independence.  "
 KOR_navaltech:0 "French Naval Tech"

 KOR_westerntrade:0 "Welcome Western Trade"

 KOR_tsushimatrade:0 "Increase Tsushima Trade"
 KOR_tsushimatrade_desc:0 "For centuries our principle form of contact with our Japanese neighbors has been through the small island of Tsushima.

 KOR_japankorean_desc:0 "We have obtained sufficient favor with our Japanese neighbors to propose a tentative alliance with them.

 korea.1.d:0 "Since the beginning of King Sunjo’s reign in 1800, the influential Andong Kim clan has risen to dominate nearly all corners of Joseon politics and society. With their uncontested power over the royal court and the yangban bureaucracy, the Joseon kings, including the current ruler King Cheoljong, have been stripped of almost all of their monarchical authority by this Sedo regime.
