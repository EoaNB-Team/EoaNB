#Foreign Policy
saxonyforeign.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Saxony –\nStarting Situation: Foreign Affairs"
saxonyforeign.1.d:0 "\n[SAX.GetNameDef] is in a difficult position. Sandwiched between the two German hegemons, the [PRS.GetName] and the [AUS.GetName], and bordering the third German power, the [BAV.GetName] to the south, the government will have to tread carefully, especially on the international stage.\n\nWhilst membership in the Zollverein is of vital economic importance, our relationship to the Zollverein's leading power, Prussia, has not been the greatest. In fact, Saxony had nearly been annexed completely by the [PRS.GetName] during the Vienna Congress of 1815, as a punishment for siding with Napoleon until the last minute.\n\nOnly the intervention of the [AUS.GetName] prevented the complete incorporation of our kingdom into the Prussian state back then, but we still lost over half of our territory and nearly 40% of our population as part of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna. The days when we were considered a European middle power are over, and we only barely managed to prevent the Prussian unification initiative after the March Revolution, known as the Erfurt Union.\n\nWe will have to decide how to proceed from here. We made some promising progress working with the other German minors lately and continuing down this path should be our best option, although it might be hard to get all parties involved on the same page. At the same time we should be careful not to antagonize Austria and Prussia, or our days as an independent country could be numbered..."

### IDEAS ###
#Country Ideas
SAX_idea_napoleonic_war_defeat:0 "Napoleonic War Defeat"
SAX_idea_napoleonic_war_defeat_desc:0 "Saxony suffered a major defeat in the Battle of Leipzig in the Napoleonic Wars. Thousands of troops deserted to the enemy side, adding upon the thousands of casualties. The Saxon countryside was destroyed and the new King was taken prisoner by the Prussians. The Saxon military and their state as well would not easily recover from the defeat in the war as a new Kingdom."
SAX_idea_anti_prussian_sentiments:0 "Anti Prussian Sentiments"
SAX_idea_anti_prussian_sentiments_desc:0 "Just over 40 years ago, Prussia stripped away 60% of Saxon territory as a result of the Congress of Vienna. Prussia was barely stopped from annexing the entire nation, it is clear they have little regard for the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Saxony. The Napoleonic Wars turned Prussia into Europe’s superpower, and their clear ambitions to unite all German states is most retrograde to Saxon existence."
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_1:0 "Sorbian Tensions"
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_1_desc:0 "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. For centuries, Saxons have forcibly assimilated Sorbs through a destruction of Sorbian culture, literature, and language. Recently, the Sorbs have become more boisterous, thousands of them call for an end to the assimilation, and the tensions now risk boiling over."
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_2:0 "Sorbian Minority"
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_2_desc:0 "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. The Sorbian national culture is currently enjoying its heyday in poetry, music, literature, and language. Nevertheless, the way of mutual recognition will probably ease tensions and assist in their peaceful assimilation in the long run."

#Country Leader Descriptions
SAX_FERDINAND_VON_ZSCHINSKY_LEADER_DESC:0 "Having studied and worked as a lawyer in the private, public, and aristocratic spheres, Ferdinand von Zschinsky served a two-week stint as the head of Saxony’s Ministry of the Interior in 1848 before being appointed leader of the Saxon government by King Friedrich August II in 1849.\n\nFerdinand’s leadership has been ideologically mixed; one of his government’s first actions was the dissolution of the Saxon State Parliament and the reinstatement of the less liberal 1831 constitution, (a major reversal of concessions made in the wake of the 1848 revolutions) but on the other hand he has also stripped feudal landlords of their legal jurisdiction and separated the powers of the state and judiciary.\n\nWhile his time in office has been consequential for Saxony, Ferdinand von Zschinsky is in ailing health, and he likely does not have much more time to lead."
