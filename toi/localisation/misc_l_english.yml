 raj.0.t:0 "The State Of The Company"
 raj.0.d:0 "The British East India company was founded on December 31st, 1600, as a joint-stock company with the goal of destroying Spanish and Portuguese monopolies on the Indian Ocean Trade. The Company soon eclipsed the Dutch and Portuguese, along with the French after the Seven Years’ War, were they established a monopoly over colonialism in Asia, as well as trade in Asia. Indian opium, tea, silk, and saltpetre gave the company a reliable, convenient, and plentiful source of income. Although everything seemed to be going swimmingly, the situation within the Raj was reaching a boiling point. The British East India Company had been exploiting ethnic, religious, and tribal differences in order to attain control over the subcontinent. The Company had also enacted many unpopular western reforms that went against the beliefs of the locals, and new tariffs, along with other trade restrictions enacted by the crown, would cripple the internal economy of the Mughal Empire, reversing the proto-industrialization that was left over from the Mughal Empire, and the rich and prosperous eternal economy. Famines also became a glaring problem within Indian society, with over 60 million dying in famines between the 18th and 20th centuries. Many of these problems, as well as the introduction of cartridges made of pig skin into the army and the burden of British Rule, would result in the Sepoy Rebellion Of 1857 (Indian Mutiny). This is a decisive moment in British History, as the “Jewel Of The British Empire”, could soon fall back into the hands of the natives, or it could also be the start of an age of brutal repression, with an increased effort to assimilate the Indian subcontinent into the British Empire…"

Already a few years ago a Chinese ship called by the Westeners the 'HMS Arrow' was forced to fly the British flag due to us not having a flag. This led to our capturing of the ship, but due to flying the British flag, we gave the British an excuse to attack us. In order to avoid such a misunderstanding in the future we should adopt a national flag according to Western designs. It has been proposed that our new flag will be triangular in order to avoid any confusion with the Eigth Banners rectangular flags. The flag will feature the traditional symbols of Your Majesty, the Five-clawed Dragon and the Flaming Pearl."
