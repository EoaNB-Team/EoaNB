 BRA_ambition_and_tradition_desc:0 "The Empire under the conservative party will rise to even greater heights. The Jaguar's roar will be felt throughout the continent as the Brazilians will stablish their control over their rightful land. We will keep our imperial and millenial traditions of the proud Brazilian people, independent and united under one yellow and green flag."

 BRA_declare_south_american_ambition_desc:0 "The Brazilian State will reign all over the continent, spreading its influence from the disputed platine regions of the south to the dense and mysterious amazon! The Imperial army shall rule over everything that it deserves. Glory to Brazil!"
 BRA_tame_the_progressives:0 "Tame the Progressives"
 BRA_tame_the_progressives_desc:0 "After our declarations of expansionist ideals, we were judged by warmongering and dangerous by the popular progressives. We should try to control their influence and calm them down so the government and the army can proceed with their actions with little opposition."
 BRA_appease_liberal_entrepreneurs:0 "Appease Liberal Entrepreneurs"
 BRA_appease_liberal_entrepreneurs_desc:0 "To ensure the companies and their liberal supporters, we need to appease them with some funding and political benifits for them. Getting the industrial and railway companies on our side will weaken the liberals and we'll be able to manipulate them easily."
 BRA_centralize_government_power:0 "Centralize Government Power"
 BRA_centralize_government_power_desc:0 "A Centralization of the power is needed to ensure the imperial might over it's subjects and parties. We need to reduce the power of the council, parliament and provinces, increasing the army's control over them to ensure the security and prosperity of those states. Brazil will be an united nation moved by a glorious sense of national union if we truly unite the empire."
 BRA_ally_the_church:0 "Ally the Church"
 BRA_ally_the_church_desc:0 "Catholicism is our State religion, and it therefore is an institution that is intimately involved with our national government, most especially our Emperor. If we were to increase our ties with the Church, more and more devout Catholics could be swayed to our cause."
 BRA_pro_war_propaganda:0 "Pro-War Propaganda"
 BRA_pro_war_propaganda_desc:0 "If we are to realize our ambitions, the people must be on our side. Widely distributing patriotic propaganda through both print and word of mouth will be the most effective means of inspiring the Brazilian people into action."

 BRA_reclaim_the_cisplatine_province_desc:0 "In 1828, Brazil was forced to relinquish its control over its southern Cisplatine Province in the face of a tremendous period of weakness after a bitter war with the Argentinians and the Uruguayans. The product of our weakness is now the independent country of Uruguay. We must erase this shame that has befallen our nation, and recover our lost Cisplatina!"
 BRA_artigas_border_crisis:0 "Artigas Border Crisis"
 BRA_artigas_border_crisis_desc:0 "Merely laying claim to Uruguay will not be enough for us to justify our conflict with the Uruguayans.

The colony was added to the Kingdom of Brazil, but was soon handed back to the French after Napoleon Bonaparte's ouster. As French Guiana was a former holding of Brazil, we are justified in returning it to its rightful owner."
 BRA_discredit_the_paris_treaty:0 "Discredit the Paris Treaty"
 BRA_discredit_the_paris_treaty_desc:0 "The Paris Treaty was the agreement the Portuguese signed with the French to return Guiana back to France after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The French are wholly undeserving of that colonial holding which is now used only as a penal colony. We should agitate for Brazilian reclamation of the territory that we had lawfully seized from the French."
 BRA_demand_french_guyana:0 "Demand French Guiana"

 BRA_take_in_refugees:0 "Take in Refugees"

 BRA_recognize_csa:0 "Recognize the CSA"
 BRA_recognize_csa_desc:0 "As the American Civil War is a conflict that can impact not only North America, but the Southern continent too, we should determine with what side our sympathies lie. As the [CSA.GetName] is a fellow slave-holding nation, it would be in our best interests to offer our support to them. Officially recognizing their independence is a crucial first step toward upholding their cause."
 BRA_support_the_south:0 "Support the South"
 BRA_support_the_south_desc:0 "The [CSA.GetName] is heavily outnumbered and outgunned by their Northern opponents. If they are to survive, they will be needing outside assistance. We should immediately send some of our troops to the South to fight on their behalf."

 BRA_covert_slave_trade_desc:0 "One added benefit of supporting the Southern cause is the opening of a brand new slave market for our plantations. Although the slave trade has been all but outlawed by international maritime law, our close cooperation with the South will allow us to circumvent this."
