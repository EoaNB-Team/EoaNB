 END_OF_NEW_BEG_NAME:0 "The End of a New Beginning"
 END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "Empires are at their might. The powers of Europe spread their influence wide and far from the plains of Africa to the mountains of Asia. The end of the Crimean War ensures decades of peace and dust begins to settle in the Americas. Everything seems seamless, and the spread of civilization has brought another Renaissance onto the world. Yet cracks are not unseen; the British colonies of India crumble, and only God forsees what this will mean for the colonial powers. \n The end of a system written in centuries is nigh, an end that will bring a new beginning to the world as we know it."
 ENG_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "Decades of the Victorian Era has shown the uncontested Britain rule of the Atlantic. The crown shines as the sun that never sets upon the very edges of the known world, and each British frontier serves as a jewel in it. The world changes, however; the final jewel of India begins to crack under pressure. Religious conflicts have inflated to the point of threatening the position of the undefeatable Empire, and when one colony topples the rest would follow. Now the most feared has happened, the rebels have captured Delhi, and established a base. Britain still has plenty of men to her disposal, but without caution this very mutiny could lead to a downfall of India."
 USA_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "America enjoys a generation of prosperity and growth. Following the Manifest Destiny, the United States have expanded their reach to the lands once seized by the natives and Mexicans. Although the States aren't absolutely free from conflict, the Mormon rebellion in Utah troubles the nation, and continued arguments about the rights of slaves go on within the Free States and Border Ruffians. \nThese scars left untreated will leave a conflict that troubles the very Constitution of the United States, and left not resolved will eventually rip the nation apart."
 FRA_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "Not a few months ago, the Treaty of Paris ended the bloody conflict between Russia and the allied forces, bringing another era of 'peace' to the powers of Europe. Balance in the Black Sea has been restored; but the French Empire is hardly at rest. France still is taking its time rebuilding its Empire, and Napoleon III's ambitions towards the Italian lands bring tension to arise in the Alps. \nShrouded in prestige of victory and a new empire, France is meeting a new era."
 PRS_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "Prussia is on the rise. The victory of the Napoleonic Era still is engraved within the Prussians, and ever since they have faced no defeat. Controlling most of the German states, Prussia has grown to a world-wide power ever since the Revolutions of 1848. However even within the German Confederation, the rivalry between Prussia and the Austrian Empire troubles the weakly confined states. With King Frederick William's health on the line, the nation is more vulnerable than ever. \nNot only Prussia recognises her strength, and it is time to prove how it can be used."
 RUS_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "Bitter defeat spreads across the nation, as the Crimean war has come to an end with the Russians on the short end of the stick. Modernisation might have been too large a task for Russia, and now after the humiliation they have suffered the road to reformation will only grow steeper. However all is not yet lost; Russia still has many roads to recover from the wars. The Qing are battered from the Opium Wars, and the Afghanistani remain as open ground for the Empire. \n Russia's history is only to start now."
 AUS_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "The Austrian Empire has been the uncontested power of Central Europe for centuries. Their reign and influence spans over tens of nationalities and the remnants of the Habsburg house still resides within countless numbers of courts. Their power was challenged once with the rise of Napoleon, but with the Western threat quelled and Russia recently defeated in the Crimean War, no-one in Europe remains to challenge the Austrian's power on land. But all is not stable; the intricate balance settled decades ago has broken 9 years ago, and Prussia continues to threat Austria by expanding their power in German lands."
 PIE_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "Preparations for a new Italy are complete. Cavour has proved his legitimacy with the alliance of the Crimean through skrew diplomacy, and elevated the Kingdom of Sardinia to the order of the world powers. Sardinia-Piedmont has come a long way; but still a long road remains. The heart of the Roman Empire is controlled by the Papacy, and Southern Italy by the Two Sicilies. How a new Italy will be sculpted is decided on how the three powers retain their balance in the peninsula, and defend themselves from the cowering powers of Europe. The Risorgimento seems a step's pace far, but is a mile's march away."
 CHI_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "History has never been so crushing to the Empire. During the Opium War the Westerners came with warships and cannons; and they are here again. The Qing have remained as the greatest power of the east for millenia, and in the span of decades their strength has not only been challenged, but proved futile against imperialism and colonialism. Not much has changed since the first war, and now the Chinese have to protect their sovereignity and the Holy Mandate to their lands. \nAn uneasy position remains for the Empire, as like many whom once were undefeatable but collapsed under change."
 POR_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "Portugal has gone through a period of reform and revolt recently. After the old party was abdicated in 1851, a time of industrial modernization and political instability has formed Portugal to what it is now - a fair naval power with some colonial ambitions, ready to impose its will on the world."
 BRA_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "The Empire of Brazil was put through revolts and political instability during the Regency. Once the Emperor took power, he started to reform the country, and with efficient diplomacy, he managed to ensure Brazilian hegemony on South America, and with economic and scientific innovations, Brazil is now on a golden age. But the countries in South America threaten the Empire. \nSlavery and Industrialization are problems that the emperors need to solve, it depends on the population whether Brazil will become a superpower or collapse."
 GRE_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "Greece, the cradle of Western Civilisation, this mountainous corner of Europe had for centuries been part of various empires until the Revolution of 1821. The ten-year war that ensued against the Ottomans and their allies would end with the Battle of Navarino. Britain, France and Russia helped Greece win independence and installed Otto von Wittelsbach as King.\n Greece however in 1857 is a nation full of contrasts: a rich history and a poor present. Greece is heavily in debt, weakened by political strife and always willing to liberate her children living in Ottoman lands. The Hellenic nation has been reborn and needs firm hands to lead it to glory."
 TSH_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "It is an uncertain time for the centuries-old Tokugawa Shogunate. Since 1853, the fear of the West finally breaking down the wall of isolationism that had protected Japan since the 17th century was realized under the weight of Commodore Matthew Perry's famous demand for the opening of Japan. With the arrival of his ominous "black ships", a decade of sociopolitical and economic strife has ravaged the islands. The people are divided over whether to trust these foreigners, or remove them by any means necessary. Whether the Japanese people will put their faith in the Shōgun or the Emperor to carry out this decision, only time will tell..."
 BAV_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "After Maximilian II. took over the throne after Ludwig I., a lot has changed in the Kingdom of Bavaria. Together with his Minister Ludwig von der Pfordten, King Max tries to strengthen the idea of the Trias, the so-called Third Deutschland. Along with Austria-Prussian tensions rising, Bavaria has to take a stance on who to trust and to follow - if someone like this even exists."
 PRU_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "Peru finally achieved its independence agaisnt Spain fighting alongside many South American rebellious republics in 1821. The young republic rose in its first years and managed to unite in a confederation with Bolivia, which was heavily opposed and ended in rebellions for disunification that lead Peru in a period of Anarchy as the military fought for power. \n With President Ramón Castilla liberalizing the nation and educating the population, the ruling classes and the military have revolted and the recovering Republic is once again divided in a state of civil war."
 NATION_DIVIDED_NAME:0 "A Nation Divided"
 NATION_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "The world is on thin ice once again; the Americans have been plunged into civil war, and Prussia threatens to distablize the balance in Europe after their crushing defeat in the Italian War. War is not eminent across Europe yet, but only god will tell how chaos will rupture the peace."
 CSA_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "The Confederacy has rosen. Different cultures, different views and different policies lead to the inevitable division. \n\nThe Confederate States now must decide, whether to stand their ground in the southern states, or reclaim the lands of the Union for their own. The strike of Fort Sumter will only be one of many..."
 USA_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "For the last decade, the United States has gone through attempts towards liberty; the beginning of a Civil War shows how effortless it might have been. \n\nThe Union has a mission to reunite the Americans under one banner, the torch of freedom no matter how blood may be spilled... Otherwise the Americans could remain divided."
 FRA_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "The French Empire is on the rise; under Napoleon III's rule the French has seen many victories in their current wars. However, France is not unchallenged within Europe, the rise of the Prussians threat the fragile balance restored decades ago, and Catholic supporters are outraged at the new Italian state. \n\n A new conflict is simmering."
 PRS_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "Ever since the March revolutions, the idea of a new Germany was clear and seemingly unevitable. Many states under the German Confederation urge for a new nation; the question is who shall lead it. \n\nFor long Prussia has seen the Austrians as their nemesis, and saw themselves as the heir to the Holy Roman Empire. The false peace within Europe is soon to be shattered."
 AUS_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "After adopting the February Patent not quite far ago, the Austrian Empire is in their prime. Some disputes within the Magyar question the Austrian authority, but the Hungarians are the least of the Austrian problems. \n\nThe newly rising Prussia challenges Austria in their long heritage of Germanic rule, and conflicts over the lands of Schleswig-Holstein rise. The German Question must be settled, one way or another."
 ITA_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "Italy is finally on the verge to unification, after the victory of the Second War of Independence against Austria and the successful Mille expedition. Victor Emmanuel is now the leader of the new Italian Kingdom, proclaimed less than a month ago. \n\nNow the Roman Question of Rome and Venice rises, and within the nation the French control of Savoy and Nice sows discontent. It is questionable if Rome will rise again, but when it does so blood will be spilled."
 OTO_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "Modernization is rapidly under process in Europe, and the Ottomans were chasing the westernizing process for the last century. It was quite evident that the Ottomans were in decline, despite their close victory in the Crimean Wars. Abdülmecit I is now old, and his rule could end any day. \n\nThe Ottomans are put upon a long road of tribulations, and the following decades will be decisive for their survival."
 ENG_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "The mid-Victorian Era has come in the land where the sun never sets. Russia has been beaten in the Crimean War and at home, peace and prosperity spreads across the empire. The crown of Great Britain seems unchallenged; but even now trouble stirs. England is surrounded by rising threats in both Europe and America. \n\nHow they react will forever change the destiny of the world."
 OTHER_EONAB_DESC:0 "The other countries of the world."
 HOL_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "The 19th century hasn't been kind to the Netherlands with the loss of Belgium, a part of their colonies and the VOC, the Netherlands has hard and turmoil filled times ahead. The coming years will determine if they're gonna gain their place in the sun or forever get left behind as an unimportant and small state at the edge of Europe."
