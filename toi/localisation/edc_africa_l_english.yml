Many European powers decided to begin colonization of their own so that no one power would control the entirety of the Dark Continent. However, the relative peace in Europe that that has been enjoyed for so long may disappear through conflicts in Africa, and the many woven threads of alliance may trigger an even larger war. A conference should probably be organized to regulate trade and colonization in Africa before the situation gets out of hand. However, it might be equally advantageous not to; we could obtain excuses for war on the European continent because of conflicts far away..."
