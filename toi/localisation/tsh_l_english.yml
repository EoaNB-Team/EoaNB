 TSH_vic_greater_control_on_gold_market_desc:0 "The matters of the economy has long been dealt with by trading guilds and not by our own hand. The current situation doesn't allow for this to continue without state interference, and so, we will regulate economic matters more regularly."
 TSH_vic_international_exchange_rates:0 "Adopt International Exchange Rates"
 TSH_vic_international_exchange_rates_desc:0 "The differences between Japanese exchange rates and international rates is what caused this great economic upheaval in the first place. We will adopt international standards, which should stop further outflow of value out of the nation."

 TSH_vic_national_development_desc:0 "Since the 200 years of peace that followed our victory at Sekigahara, economic development in the nation has not been particularly led or coordinated. Officials have issued public works over the years sporadically and willy-nilly. With the opening of the nation, however, perhaps a more concerted effort towards development is needed?"
 TSH_vic_assist_han_development:0 "Assist Han Development"
 TSH_vic_assist_han_development_desc:0 "While the Han can mostly fend for themselves, the string of failures to prevent Western interference has led to extensive criticism and resentment of the Bakufu among our feudal lords.

 TSH_vic_focus_tozama_desc:0 "The Tozama are the decendants of the daimyo that chose to oppose the Tokugawa at Sekigahara, and the most vocal critics of the Shogunate's policies as of late. Their discontent is concerning, but perhaps it would be better to reinforce our allies in the Fudai instead?"

 TSH_vic_kabunakama_monopoly_question_desc:0 "The Kabunakama are the various guilds and merchant associations that represent the merchant classes. For a long time, they have held state sanctioned monopolies and grants over various goods and services. In exchange, a sizable tax obligation had to be payed to the Shogunate for the privilege. At multiple occasions there have been attempts to both question or abolish these systems, but the guilds have resisted fiercly. Another such occasion has come, and it's time to decide if we want to maintain our current agreements."
 TSH_vic_tax_reform:0 "Tax Reform"
 TSH_vic_tax_reform_desc:0 "The Kemi system has long been severely lacking in its task of tax collection, mostly due to endemic corruption among its responsible officials. Reforms are needed, but will be lengthy and take time to implement."

 TSH_vic_foreign_expertise:0 "Foreign Expertise"
 TSH_vic_foreign_expertise_desc:0 "While the foreign barbarians of the West are an unwelcome intruder to our lands, they bring with them powerful weapons and the know-how to use them.

 TSH_vic_unit_field_training:0 "Unit Field Training"

 TSH_vic_centralized_army_effort_desc:0 "The armies of the barbarians of the West make use of well-developed hierarchies of command, combined with the use of modern weaponry and crafty field tactics to defeat an enemy on the field. Though these concepts are not foreign to us, the West has refined this type of warfare beyond our abilities. A centralized army following a western model is required to maintain a strong army!"
 TSH_vic_integration_of_domain_leadership:0 "Integration of Domain Leadership"
 TSH_vic_integration_of_domain_leadership_desc:0 "With our daimyo having more obligations to provide levies to our defence, it would be good to incorperate the leadership of each of our vassals into a central command.

 TSH_vic_reviewing_the_bakufu_navy_desc:0 "Japan, as an island nation, is heavily dependent on its navy to be able to defend itself from intruders coming from the seas. However, as with much of our fighting force, 200 years of peace has left our capabilities to defend our seas sorely lacking. The incursion of Commodore Perry is a clear testament to this, and serious investment into naval development must be made."

 TSH_vic_consort_with_foreign_navies_desc:0 "To redevelop our navy to the best that it can be, it would be prudent to catch up with modern naval convention from the navies around the world. We have done so in the past, and the present is no different. Let us do so."

 TSH_vic_send_cadets_abroad_desc:0 "Sending cadets and students abroad to foreign schools and navies will allow for future officers to learn from the best, while making useful contacts among foreign navies. Sending them away for some time to learn, then, is seemingly only beneficial."

 TSH_vic_foreign_steamship_dealing_desc:0 "Most of our navy is of foreign construction, and for the forseeable future, will remain so until we gather enough experience and equipment to make our own. If we are to expand our navy, we'll have to purchase some ships abroad."

 TSH_vic_legacy_of_ragnaku_desc:0 "The study of foreign literature had long been banned by the Bakufu over concerns that it would lead people astray. However, it is undeniable that Japan's modernization efforts would be much slower without the work of Rangaku schoolars efforts to translate and learn about the advances of science. Their legacy may grant us great fortune in the future, and so we shall continue to bear it."

 ####FOCUS EVENTS####
 shogunate_japan.0.t:0 "The Tokugawa Shogunate"
 shogunate_japan.0.d:0 "Ever since Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Japan entered into an era of unprecedented unity, stability, and progress under his new Shogunate. This era, dubbed the Edo Period after the bakufu capital, would see the beginnings of Japan's complete withdrawal from the outside world, save for brief contacts with China and Korea under the policy of sakoku, or closed country, enacted between 1633-1639. With its strong isolationist stance, Japan was able to resist the spread of Christianity and other Western influences within the country, maintaining its independence, at the cost of sealing off contact with modern innovations, save for a small Dutch trading post in the bay of Nagasaki called Dejima. Although contacts with the Dutch were limited, Japanese scholars were able to obtain a fair amount of knowledge on modern medicine and technology through the Rangaku studies, but the country as a whole still lagged far behind the West. \n \nThis 220-year paradigm, and the peace that came with it, suddenly came to a screeching halt when American Commodore Matthew C. Perry steamed into Edo Bay on July 8, 1853 and demanded that Japan end its long period of isolation and adopt formal trade relations with the US. To back up his demands were the might of his powerful steamships, which the Japanese called the black ships because of the color of the warships and the smoke that belched out of their coal-fired steam engines. The Shogunate, virtually threatened at gunpoint to end sakoku, finally agreed to sign the Convention of Kanagawa with Perry on March 31, 1854. The terms of the Convention agreed to the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American vessels, ensured the safety of American castaways, and established an American consul in Japan. \n \nThe aftermath of the Convention would cast a huge shadow of doubt over the Shogun's historical responsibility to oppose Western encroachment into Japan, and it was the catalyst for the rise of the Sonno Joi movement, or the belief that the Shogun was no longer capable of resisting the West, and that the Emperor should be entrusted with such an important role. With the security of Japan deeply threatened, the Shogunate overturned many of its policies restricting its naval capabilities in 1855, and desperately sought to improve the strength of its defenses as quickly as possible. However, centuries of peace have atrophied the fighting capability of Japanese troops, and with growing discontent from the historically hostile tozama daimyo, the Shogunate is quickly approaching its day of reckoning..."

 shogunate_japan.1.t:0 "The Harris Treaty"
 shogunate_japan.1.d:0 "An envoy from [USA.GetNameDef] by the name of Townsend Harris has once again approached the Bakufu, seeking the ratification of a new, so-called Treaty of Amity and Commerce. Its contents include an exchange of diplomatic agents between the US and Japan, the additional opening of the ports of Kanagawa and Nagasaki to the existing ports of Shimoda and Hakodate agreed to be opened originally in the Convention of Kanagawa, to be effective July 4th 1859, extraterritoriality rights for their citizens, new fixed low import-export duties subject to international control, and the right of freedom of religious expression to US nationals in Japan.\n\nThese demands are much higher than the treaty signed with Commodore Perry in the past, and the sudden introduction of foreigners into the shogunal capital of Edo is bound to cause a great deal of socioeconomic instability. However, we are sadly in no real position to oppose these demands, and if we were to refuse this treaty we may end up the same way China did in their Opium War. Our only choice now is, should we bring this before the Emperor and convince him to ratify the treaty, or is the signature of a bakufu official enough?"

As our Emperor's understanding of these foreigners stems merely from ukiyo-e prints of Westerners depicted as deplorable demons, it is unlikely that the bakufu has any capability of convincing him to open our ports to their traders.\n\nAlthough the Shogun himself could still ratify the treaty, acceding to the Westerners' demands without Imperial support would certainly sow popular disapproval of the Bakufu."

 shogunate_japan.17.d:0 "For an exceedingly long time in the Shogunate's history there have been agreements between the ruling Bakufu and various small, but important, merchant guilds. These are the Kabunakama, which form various merchant groups within differing market groups and trades within the country, primarily in the large cities. While initially the Shoguns were hesitant to cooperate with their demands, they were eventually given grants and various rights to monopolize certain parts of the Japanese economy. This created strong guilds that could cooperate with furthering the economy, but also a strong interest group who would resist any attempts at relinquishing their given grants.\n\nRōjū Mizuno Tadakuni attempted a decade prior to restrain the Kabunakama's monopoly practices, though ended in failure due to extensive push-back from the guilds. As it stands today, the merchant guilds remain in a strong position. While we benefit from their economic practices, some argue that the Kabunakama are smothering new buinesses with monopolies and restricting competition between businesses to provide better solutions. Tadakuni failed to remove their privileges before, but they are a useful boon to us. What to do with these merchant guilds?"

That the Shogun's allowance of the West to enter Japan, and the subsequent disasterous events in earthquakes and famines, were the anger of the Gods that the Shogun had so carelessly betrayed. Another omen has struck. In the many houses of the metropolis that is Edo, mothers, sons, daughters and fathers lie, dead or alive in their beds afflicted by another passenger of these Black Ships.

Having suffered from pox in his childhood, and survived, it has left him severely weakened and slightly scarred.\n\nWith much uncertainty in current times originating with the arrival of the "Southern Barbarians", and the rise of anti-Bakufu and anti-western movements in the country-side, the lack of an heir poses a great issue. If Iesada is unable to produce a son, which seems increasingly the case, then a candidate must be chosen from one of his cadet houses. Factionalism and in-fighting has already begun within the Shogunate over who may take Iesada's place should he pass away...

Clearly arguing that the ascendance of rival candidate Iemochi, being much younger and inexperienced, would lead to ruin for the Shogunate.\n\nThe Court seems to have been swayed by their words, perhaps agreeing in their analysis of young Iemochi, or on the ties of blood which the Court and the Lords share. Whatever may be the case, it is clear that Keiki's position has become stronger in the Court and therefore generally..."
 shogunate_japan_l.2.a:0 "Keiki strikes first!"
 shogunate_japan_l.3.t:0 "Hotta Masayoshi supports Keiki Hitotsubashi"
 shogunate_japan_l.3.d:0 "Rōjū Hotta Masayoshi, one of the most important elders of the Bakufu administration has also traveled to Kyoto to add his weight behind Keiki Hitotsubashi's candidacy before the Imperial Court. Underlining the importance of competent rulership to guide the Shogunate to a prosperous future, his support for the experienced Keiki is reasoned by this argumentation. Before a figure as important as Hotta, the Court is inclined to agree. His seeking of approval of the Court has also been received with positivity among courtiers, as it is hoped that the Court and Bakufu can cooperate more efficiently.\n\nHotta Masayoshi's efforts has rewarded him with the support of the Imperial Court, as well as an Imperial decree supporting the policy of the Shogunate. Keiki's cause grows..."
 shogunate_japan_l.3.a:0 "The elder takes his stance!"
 shogunate_japan_l.4.t:0 "Fudai Lords push back!"
 shogunate_japan_l.4.d:0 "The Fudai, having long enjoyed the favour of the Tokugawa Shogunate, have reacted strongly to the advance of Keiki's campaign. Considering their opponents, it is perhaps unsurprising. The Tozama support Keiki's leadership as a levelheaded ruler to further their own interests within the Shogunate as well, which would imply in no uncertain terms that their privileges would be imposed on.\n\nThe Fudai are now making their influence within the Bakufu felt, as they push for the advancement of their candidate in Yoshitomi. The Fudai, being closely related to the Tokugawa, have signficantly more weight and ties within the Shogunate than the alienated and shunned Tozama. Keiki has advanced quite some distance, but will he be defeated by the heavily entrenched will of the Fudai?"
 shogunate_japan_l.4.a:0 "Order does not go unchallenged!"
 shogunate_japan_l.4.b:0 "Stop them!"
 shogunate_japan_l.5.t:0 "Revocation of the Imperial Decree"
 shogunate_japan_l.5.d:0 "Recently, with the departure of Hotta Masayoshi from the Imperial Court in Kyoto, various rumors have spread that the Imperial decree he was sent with was not supported by the Emperor himself and was a creation of the Court without his own approval...\n\nWhile the Court is rebuffing this rumor, its weight has increased with the Fudai weighing in on the rumors credibility. Meeting increasing pressure and disproval from the Emperor, the Court has decided to cut their losses and recind the Imperial Decree, rendering it moot as a bargaining tool. Another blow to the Hitotsubashi Party and their candidate, but a major benefit for the Kii Party."
 shogunate_japan_l.5.a:0 "Divine Judgement!"
 shogunate_japan_l.5.b:0 "Is it necessary?"
 shogunate_japan_l.7.t:0 "Matsudaira Shungaku becomes Tairō"
 shogunate_japan_l.7.d:0 "In the middle of the political in-fighting of the Shogunate, it would seem that the supporters of the candidate from the house of Hitotsubashi has gotten the better of the clashing. Matsudaira Shungaku, with the help of the influence of the Court and supporting Lords, have been able to overturn the Fudai of the Bakufu and claim the title of Tairō for himself. Shungaku, being a supporter of Keiki's campaign, is expected to use his influence to push for the candidacy of Shogun for Keiki. This turn of events has lead to the Hitotsubashi Party to hold the advantage over the Kii Party, and Keiki's ambition to become Shogun has now become a strong certainty."
 shogunate_japan_l.7.a:0 "An important lynchpin..."
 shogunate_japan_l.8.t:0 "Death of Iesada Shogun"
 shogunate_japan_l.8.d:0 "What many have long expected or feared has now become a reality. The 13th Shogun of the Tokugawa Clan has passed on, losing what many saw as an inevitable battle against disease.\n\nThe procession and burial of the former Shogun's body was met with solemn but tense silence. Sorrow, emptiness, contempt, duty and plotting are all emotions and mindsets that fill the air during this moment. The Shogun's death has finally given justification in the question of who will take his place, and the supporters of each candidate knows of this fact very well; the Shogun died childless, and a new heir must be selected from the Tokugawa family to rule.\n\nIesada Shogun's death gave rise to two prominent factions that each supported a candidate that they would prefer to take the position of Shogun. Ii Naosuke, the Ōoku and the Bakufu are the main supporters of the youngest candidate, Tokugawa Yoshitomi in his bid to succeed Iesada. However, while there are many who support Yoshitomi's bid to the position, a second candidate has also come forth to contest Yoshitomi's claim. Tokugawa Yoshinobu, son of Tokugawa Nariaki of Mito, a political opponent of Ii Naosuke, has come forth to contest Yoshitomi's claim and to make his own bid as Shogun. Yoshinobu is older than Yoshitomi, and has more experience as a leading figure, but his father's connections and support of the notion of imperial rule makes him a dubious candidate in the eyes of the Bakufu.\n\nWhoever takes power of the two will define the era of the Shogunate!"
 shogunate_japan_l.8.a:0 "Who will become Shogun?"
 shogunate_japan_l.9.t:0 "A New Shogun!"
 shogunate_japan_l.9.d:0 "Today marks the beginning of a new rule in Japan; a new Shogun has been chosen!\n\nThe political battle has concluded, and out of the dust of manouvering, lobbying and appeals there stands only one candidate..."

 shogunate_japan_fl.1.t:0 "Attack on Russian sailors!"
 shogunate_japan_fl.1.d:0 "Yokohama was, prior to the entry of Commodore Perry's black ships, merely a small fishing village south of the Shogunal capital in Edo. However, the small village has shown a trend to grow rapidly in the wake of recent treaties with the Western powers, making the city a port open for powers that have signed treaties with us in the recent past.\n\nWhile most in the Bakufu believe that the opening of ports to appease Western interests, over outright rejecting them, was the lesser of two evils, many of our subjects are staunchly opposed to their incursion on national soil. This has now culminated into open-day attacks on foreigners, and the small fishing town of Yokohama has now become the site of the murder of two Russian sailors by rouge Samurai discontent with the Shogun's latest policies. The sailors were found bloodily in pieces, violently struck down by the blade of one or more Samurai. In the area more bodies were found, being of Chinese traders and native Japanese attendées serving Westerners.\n\nThe incident has spurred both the anger of the Russian embassy and the cheers of treaty opponents. The Russian minister demands that the perpetrators be caught and handed over for judgement, and for the local garrison to prevent such attacks occurring in the future."
 shogunate_japan_fl.1.a:0 "What!?"
 shogunate_japan_fl.2.t:0 "Attack on Dutch captains!"
 shogunate_japan_fl.2.d:0 "Another attack on foreigners in Yokohama has occurred!\n\nToday, two Dutch captains were found dead on the streets of Yokohama after another assault by rouge Samurai. Tensions within the country has been high since the opening of the nation to the outside world and the barbarian Westerners, and the public upheval over the Shogunate's decision to fold in the face of the Western might has only stoked that tension further. Today marks another expression of that tension as the two captains were cut down around the Yokohama harbour, much like the previous murder on two Russian sailors. The Dutch were quick to lodge a complaint over the incident, but were quickly addressed with promises to capture the perpetrators.\n\nThe discontent over the state of the Shogunate is spreading further within Japan, and the people are fiercly debating the proper course of action which the nation should take in relation to these Westerners. Things are undecided and small now, but soon there may come a time when the fate of the Shogunate must be decided."
 shogunate_japan_fl.2.a:0 "Another one!?"
 shogunate_japan_fl.3.t:0 "Attack on a French minister servant!"
 shogunate_japan_fl.3.d:0 "A new attack on a foreigner has occurred!\n\nThis time a servant of the French minister in Japan was attacked, but not killed. The servant was wounded by discontent Samurai, but before they could finish the job, the other servants as well as the local garrison and minister retinue interfered. The rouge attacker fled the scene when the pressure mounted, but was later captured.\n\nThe incident marks the third attack within a year, and murmurs among the Western dignitaries speak of moving more guards into Yokohama to protect their officials. It would seem that their patience is running thin. Things are calm for now, but if another incident like this should occur, then it is likely that a simple apology will not suffice..."
 shogunate_japan_fl.3.a:0 "This is getting out of hand!"

As it is not expected that someone of such a young age can rule a nation without great ability or great difficulty, the young Shogun will be supervised by great elder and acting regent Ii Naosuke and others. They will manage and rule in the stead of the Shogun until the young boy has learned more and come of age, in time for when he must fulfill his duty as Shogun.\n\nHis selection as Shogun has been met with mixed reactions from the Japanese people. While there are some who rejoice over the arrival of a new leader to guide them in these uncertain times for Japan, there are many dissenting voices that still speak of the weakness of the former Shogun and the Shogunate's inability to protect Japan from foreign invaders. It remains to be seen how Shogun Iemochi's rule will shape Japan and her future in the coming years, but now the winds of change will blow Japan across the ocean of time, and into the star-filled horizon of promise that is the future."

As the Shogunate continues to industrialize and bend the knee to Western powers, Daimyo and Samarai across the nation are beginning to question if it is time to return absolute power to the Emperor.\n \nThe two factions, Pro-Imperial and Pro-Shogunate are now battling for the heart of the public.
