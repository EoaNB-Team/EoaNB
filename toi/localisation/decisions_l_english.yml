Slavs were settling fields and forests of Russian plains for thousand years, then Novgorodians were settling tundras of Northern Russia and it culminated in unrestrained march in XVI and XVII centuries, when Russians have appeared to set their foothold in Siberia and the Far East. Having minor setback occured in Nerchinsk, where Qin Empire managed to make profitable for itself treaty and rob Russia of their conquests due to corruption of Russian officials, Russians still had vast reaches of Siberia to their disposal, with its rich stocks of natural resources, such as iron, copper, gems, coal, fur and wood. But this gigantic region, having space for at least another Europe, is more scarcely populated than European Russia and can't be even compared to France or Austria in terms of inhabitants. That's why Russian government always laucnhed campaigns to settle Siberia with colonists, mostly consisting of peasants and cossacks. In XIX century problem still stays while peasantry of European Russia become more and more poor with their plots of land growing smaller and smaller each generation. If government will dedicate some resources and also will get rid of corrupted bureaucrats in the trail of migrants, problems with peasantry can be very much negated... until next generation."

#eoanb_decision_reopen_textile_mill: "Reopen inactive Textile Mill in one of our States?"
#eoanb_trigger_has_4_cotton: "We have alot of cotton being produced, but not refined! Naturally, we could continue to sell the raw materials on the world markets, but perhaps it would be more prudent to refine it to cloth?\n\nThe local administration of one of our states has notifed the central planning committee that there is a deserted textile mill in their possession. With a little funding out the door, we can get this old mill going again!"
#closed_textile_mill_reopens: "The local administration in one of our states has started the work of getting the textile mill we funded back into functioning order. Further news tells us that the mill's steering board has begun hiring new workers to work the machinery, and that the mill should be operational shortly!"
#eoanb_decision_reopen_steel_mill: "Reopen inactive Steel Mill in one of our States?"
#eoanb_trigger_has_4_iron: "The production of raw iron ore is steadily proceeding as usual... But murmurs among the governors of the local cabinet in one of our states has suggested a desire to further build on the industry in the area. The primary desire being refining the iron ore to steel.\n\nThe governors note that there is a defunct steel mill that used to operate in the area, and they believe the reopening of this mill would strengthen the local economy, and thusly, the nation!"
#eoanb_trigger_has_2_coal: "Coal and different Cokes is the lifeblood of any proper industry of our time!\n\nWhile this is the case, we have an abundance which we do nothing with! The suggestion of having a manufactory make use of it by some of our cabinet governors might be just the right thing to make use of this abundant coal, unless we want to continue to sell it to the world markets, of course..."
#closed_steel_mill_reopens: "Our governors report that great progress has been made in the effort of reopening the steel mill in one of our states. Organization of the transport of raw materials for refinement has been successful, and workers are lining up in the hundreds to work the new jobs created in the mill!"
#eoanb_decision_reopen_machine_parts_factory: "Reopen inactive Machine Factory in one of our States?"
#eoanb_trigger_has_3_steel: "Our steel production is quite satisfactory for our current demands, and our sales on the world market go as is usually expected from current trends. Though now a suggestion that has been floating around the regional office has recently gained popularity.\n\nIf we were to reopen one of the old machine factories in one of our states, then we might get more value out of the excess steel we're making."
#closed_machine_parts_factory_reopens: "The machine factory we established plans of reopening has recently come to fruition! The factory is now bustling along in activity, creating both as much parts as it is creating machines for industrial use. The factory is yet to be at full speed, but the progression is quick enough to expect the plant to be ready post-haste!"
