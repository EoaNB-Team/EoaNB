It established local education authorities with defined powers, authorized public money to improve existing schools, and tried to frame conditions attached to this aid so as to earn the goodwill of managers. It was long been seen as a milestone in educational development, but recent commentators have stressed that it brought neither free nor compulsory education, and its importance has thus tended to be diminished rather than increased.[The law was drafted by William Forster, a Liberal MP, and it was introduced on 17 February 1870 after campaigning by the National Education League, although not entirely to their requirements. In Birmingham, Joseph Chamberlain, not yet a Member of Parliament, was a prominent campaigner on the issue. However, like many grassroots Liberals he opposed the bill because it was open to the possibility of subsidising Church of England schools with local ratepayers' money."

Furthermore, this fits with the Liberal Party’s disestablishmentarianism. That is, the belief that the Church of England should no longer be the official Church of England, Wales, and Ireland. In opposition to this act are the conservatives, whose antidisestablishmentarianism is legendary under Elizabeth’s tower.

Many a rebellion have had to be put down up to today, and rising republican sentiments among the native Irish have recently been fanned by a major independence movement calling themselves the 'Fenians'. Their message of demanding an Irish nation free from Great Britain has proven very appealing to our Irish subjects.\n\nTheir message of achieving this through violence, however, has proven to be a major headache for our Governor. The sporadic and violent attacks by the Fenian Brotherhood has been a major blow to the stability of the region.

 britainfocus.38.d:0 "The Extradition Case of John Anderson is among one of the most tension-filled cases in Canadian history, and will likely define Canadian-British relations for years to come. John Anderson, a former slave of North Carolina, on his way north to Canada for the sake of escaping slavery, killed a man who nearly caught him. Anderson did eventually reach Canada, and was not found and apprehended by Canadian law enforcement for six years. As he is held in our Dominion, we must determine if he should be extradited to the United Kingdom or left for the Canadians to handle."

In November she felt well enough to hold a small dinner party for their close friends; but her condition deteriorated and she died on 15 December, at the age of eighty."There was no care which she could not mitigate, and no difficulty which she could not face. She was the most cheerful and courageous woman I ever knew" her husband wrote after her death. His great adversary William Ewart Gladstone, who had liked Mary, wrote him a letter of condolence. Disraeli, touched by this sympathy from a man who disliked him, replied that "Marriage is the greatest earthly happiness when founded on mutual sympathy."."

 ###Royal Marriages
 britainroyal.1.t:0 "Marriage of Princess Alice"
 britainroyal.1.d:0 "Queen Victoria had expressed her wish that her children should marry for love, but this did not mean that her choice of suitors would necessarily be extended to anybody outside the royal houses of Europe. The Queen instructed her daughter Victoria, to produce a list of eligible princes in Europe. Her search produced only three suitable candidates: the Prince of Orange; and Prince Albert of Prussia. The Prince of Orange recently journeyed to Windsor Castle so that Queen Victoria could look him over in person, but he proved unpalatable to Alice. The prince too showed little interest in Alice, despite strong pressure from his pro-British mother. Prince Albert, too, was spurned, with Prince Frederick of Prussia remarking that his cousin would not do for "one who deserves the very best". Louis of Hesse was also suggested, a minor German royal. Louis visited Windosr, the Prince and Alice got along together. However, the other two Princes would bring a much more powerful alliance compared to the minor German state. Who should Princess Alice marry? The Prince of Orange or Albert of Prussia for a powerful alliance or the Prince of Hesse for love?"
