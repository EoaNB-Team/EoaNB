 POR_focus_consolidate_regeneration:0 "Consolidate Regeneration"
 POR_focus_consolidate_regeneration_desc:0 "As we strive to renew our dysfunctional political system and firmly entrench liberalism in this country, much work remains to be done in all spheres of public life, even though great steps were already taken, such as the constitutional amendment of 1852."
 POR_focus_ministry_of_the_public_works:0 "Creation of The Ministry Of Public Works"
 POR_focus_ministry_of_the_public_works_desc:0 "The establishment of a new ministry, dedicated to the investment in public works, commerce and industry, is vital for the ‘Regeneration’ of the country. Of particularly pressing need is the construction and maintenance of roads and ports, vital infrastructures the lack of which would leave Portugal unable to call itself a modern country."
 POR_focus_expand_army_arsenal:0 "Expand Army Arsenal"
 POR_focus_expand_army_arsenal_desc:0 "Concerns from highest levels of government about the provision and maintenance of equipment of our soldiers has led to a reorganization of the Army Arsenal, which was divided into several factories, each of them specialized in supplying the vital needs of the Portuguese Army."
 POR_focus_the_santa_clara_workshop:0 "The Santa Clara Royal Workshop"
 POR_focus_the_santa_clara_workshop_desc: "This is a critical new factory of the Army Arsenal, dedicated to carpentry and the making and repairing of small arms."
 POR_focus_the_santa_apolonia_workshop:0 "The Santa Apolonia Royal Workshop"

 POR_focus_barcarena_workshop:0 "The Barcarena Royal Workshop"
 POR_focus_barcarena_workshop_desc:0 "As one of the most vital factories of the Army Arsenal, this workshop is solely dedicated to the production of gunpowder, a vital material with consistently high demand."
 POR_focus_lisboa_carregado_railway:0 "Lisbon-Carregado Railway"
 POR_focus_lisboa_carregado_railway_desc:0 "Commissioned in 1852 by minister Fontes Pereira de Melo, and sadly plagued with several issues since its inception, the project is finally nearing its inauguration. This railway shall be the first of its kind in Portugal, the herald of the many more railways to come, railways which will bind the country together and connect it to its European partners."
 POR_focus_lisbon_porto_railway:0 "Lisbon-Porto Railway"
 POR_focus_lisbon_porto_railway_desc:0 "The two most important cities in Portugal by far, Lisboa and Porto, are currently separated by hundreds of kilometres of ill-maintained roads and occasionally rough terrain, making them somewhat akin to two strangers who happen to live in the same country. To connect these twin engines of Portugal’s economy and main drivers of its socio-cultural development, we shall construct a modern railway, befitting of a modern European nation, and its pay-off in the long-term will surely be immense."
 POR_focus_proporsal_76:0 "Proporsal 76"
 POR_focus_lisbon_madrid_connection:0 "Lisbon-Madrid Connection"
 POR_focus_lisbon_madrid_connection_desc:0 " Even though this is a complicated project on a technical level, given the terrain in question and the need to adopt our Spanish neighbours’ railway gauge (which differs from the European standard gauge), it is undoubtedly of paramount importance if we are to mitigate our geographic isolation from the rest of Europe and open up new markets from our exports."
 POR_focus_civilian_investments:0 "Civilian Investments"
 POR_focus_civilian_investments_desc:0 "Our economy, once upon a time buoyed by stupendous trading profits to cover an unhealthy overreliance on imports, finds itself in current times considerably less wealthy and in desperate need to reduce its negative trade balance. Ambitious investments must be made in very profitable industries and on the production of nationally vital products, if we are to reverse our downward trend."
 POR_focus_invicta_fabric_factory:0 "The Invicta Fabric Factory"
 POR_focus_invicta_fabric_factory_desc:0 "This factory in Porto (nicknamed the ‘Cidade Invicta’, meaning “Unvanquished City”), dedicated to the production of fabrics from various raw materials, is one of several textile factories Portuguese industrialists have established in the country, implementing the latest technological advancements and contributing to Portugal’s development."
 POR_focus_tabacco_processing:0 "Tabacco Processing"
 POR_focus_tabacco_processing_desc:0 "This is a booming industry in our country, and one of its main sources of revenue due to exports, with Portuguese industrialists opening up several new factories to cash in on this opportunity and our government fostering the sector with a range of protectionist policies."
 POR_focus_new_industries:0 "New Industries"

 POR_focus_fertilizers_production:0 "Fertilizers Production"
 POR_focus_fertilizers_production_desc:0 "The current demographic boom and accompanying nutritional needs has created a new impetus to boost agricultural productivity.

 POR_focus_porcelain_factory:0 "Porcelain Factory of Vista Alegre"
 POR_focus_porcelain_factory_desc:0 "Legally established in 1824, this factory is a shining example which other Portuguese industrialists should seek to emulate. Since its establishment, it has helped to significantly reduce our porcelain imports from China, and its artistry and success is such that it has been dubbed a ‘Royal Factory’ in 1832. If it diversifies and perfects its products, perhaps even incorporating the contribution of foreign artists, the future of Vista Alegre is sure to be bright."
 POR_focus_cement_production:0 "Cement Production"
 POR_focus_cement_production_desc:0 "Our numerous and ambitious building projects require massive amounts of building materials to complete, such as cement, for which we are overly reliant on foreign partners. It would be wise to invest in national cement production, which would have the twin benefits of growing our industrial sector and reduce our import needs."

 POR_focus_land_reforms:0 "Land Reforms"
 POR_focus_land_reforms_desc:0 "A legacy of cronyism and outdated laws, coupled with foreign invasion and civil war, has crippled the agricultural potential of Portugal. Decisive reforms must be undertaken in order to revitalize the countryside and catch up with our fellow European powers."
 POR_focus_ban_morgardios:0 "Ban Morgardios"
 POR_focus_ban_morgardios_desc:0 "Originating in Castilian legislation and formalized into Portuguese law with the Filipine Ordinances of 1603, the ‘morgadio’ is an institution dictating the rules of land property management and inheritance. Intended to counter the economic degradation of a family’s main branch by repeated inheritances, it granted several privileges to the ‘morgado’, the land holder, and caused the effective impoverishment of non-firstborn children. It is imperative that we put an end to this archaic institution."
 POR_focus_land_confiscation:0 "Land Confiscation"
 POR_focus_land_confiscation_desc:0 "Many fertile lands lie abandoned by their noble landholders, who accumulated them over time through strategic marriage alliances and now find themselves unable or unwilling to properly manage their vast properties. With the proportion of unexplored arable fields in Portugal at historic highs, these properties need to be seized from their negligent owners and handed to those who will make good use of them."
 POR_focus_new_fertilizers_1:0 "Introduction Of Quimical Fertilizers"
 POR_focus_new_fertilizers_1_desc:0 "Just like our efforts to increase the area of cultivated lands, the need for an increase in the productivity of our farmers through the use of the best fertilizers available is paramount if we are to become competitive exporters of agricultural produce."

 POR_focus_expand_vineyards:0 "Expand Vineyards"
 POR_focus_expand_vineyards_desc:0 "Port wine and other prestigious vintages are renowned internationally, and count among the few world-class products that our European lands currently export. Given their quality, volume of demand and high profitability margin, coupled with the extent of suitable plots of land that are currently unused, it is an obvious area of our economy that merits sizable investment. The efforts we make to the expand of our vineyards are sure to yield very profitable returns."
 POR_focus_expand_pork_production:0 "Expand Pork Production"
 POR_focus_expand_pork_production_desc:0 "There is a silver lining to the vast tracts of currently unused land: the widespread availability of land for animal grazing. Pork, in particular, already a popular staple in Portuguese traditional gastronomy, is very likely to be a successful bet both on the internal market and abroad."
