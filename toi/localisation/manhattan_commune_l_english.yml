 MHC_emergency_elections_event.1.d:0 "With the erruption of the American Civil War, the revolutionary council is voting on what is the best choice forward. The idealogy that wins will organize the [MHC.GetName]'s revolutionary government.

A Marxism victory would be controversial if the party's policies conflict with the revolution's Anarchist orgins. Additionally, a Social Liberalism victory would be seen as a moderate approach to dealing with unjust hierarchies. The Anarchist and Owenism factions will be aggravated if these issues are ignored."
