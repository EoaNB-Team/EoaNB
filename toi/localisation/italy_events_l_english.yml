 sardinia.9.d:0 "A number of events promoted Piedmont’s prestige in Italy and abroad. In March 1854 France and England intervened in support of the Ottoman Empire against Russia in the Crimean War. To obtain Austrian support, they were prepared to guarantee the status quo in Italy. Only Piedmont was in a position to disrupt it at that time, and Cavour negotiated an alliance with the Western powers. In May he sent to Crimea an army that performed brilliantly. As a result, Piedmont was able to assume a place among the victors at the Congress of Paris (February 1856). From this platform Cavour, achieving a diplomatic coup for Piedmont and Italy, declared that the only threat to peace in Italy, and the root cause of subversive plots, was the burdensome Austrian overlordship. Cavour’s pronouncements at the congress increased the standing of Piedmont among nationalists."

Since then the areas of Roquebrune-Menton have been under the Savoy administration to cease violence in the area.

Monaco had been apart of Napoleon I's empire and was ceded to Sardinia during the Congress of Vienna. While officially signing the treaty today it was revealed that Monaco would not be transferred to our nation. While dissapointing there is nothing we can do in this situation."
#monaco.9.a:0 "That is too bad"
monaco.4.t:0 "Sardinia Seeks to reaffirm Protectorate"
monaco.4.d:0 "As the meeting between Charles III and the Sardinian Officials has reached a point of culmination. The Sardinian officials have announced that they wish to sign a treaty that will ensure that the Protectorate status of Monaco is not disturbed while their attempts at unification go on. It is unclear if this is the best option yet, but it is certainly better than occupation. Many in our government say we should ask to be transfered to France if Sardinia takes that option, though some have pointed out that with the rebellions in the country annexation may be better than the status quo. The question of independence was also tossed around, though it is unclear if Sardinia would be willing to let that happen."

monaco.9.t:0 "Sardinia proposes Annexation"
monaco.9.d:0 "The meeting with Sardinian officials reached a boiling point after increasing tension in the room. The point was made by some of the officials from Monaco that Victor Emmanuel was not present for this meeting, unlike the kings before him who attended the first treaties with Monaco. Following some harsh words a small scuffle broke out between both sides. Closing the meeting off with a band, the Sardinians have presented their treaty which demans that Monaco surrender its independence in order to allow Sardinia to liberate it."
