 sardinia.9.d:0 "A number of events promoted Piedmont’s prestige in Italy and abroad. In March 1854 France and England intervened in support of the Ottoman Empire against Russia in the Crimean War. To obtain Austrian support, they were prepared to guarantee the status quo in Italy. Only Piedmont was in a position to disrupt it at that time, and Cavour negotiated an alliance with the Western powers. In May he sent to Crimea an army that performed brilliantly. As a result, Piedmont was able to assume a place among the victors at the Congress of Paris (February 1856). From this platform Cavour, achieving a diplomatic coup for Piedmont and Italy, declared that the only threat to peace in Italy, and the root cause of subversive plots, was the burdensome Austrian overlordship. Cavour’s pronouncements at the congress increased the standing of Piedmont among nationalists."

Austrian and French conflict over the Italian Peninsula is nothing new, but diplomacy between our nations over this region is rare. They propose that they would back an Austrian North Italian Confederation if we would support their historical claim to a Southern Kingdom; led by either a Cardinal with support from the Papacy or a Bonaparte with a proper claim. Should we accept this offer we will join the French in any conflicts with the nations of Italy and agree to split the peninsula in two. An outrageous proposal, but one that might just work."
