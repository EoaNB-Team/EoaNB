 GER_west_wall_desc:0 "The Westwall runs parallel to France's vaunted Maginot Line, occupying much of the same ground as the Siegfried Line did in the previous Weltkrieg.

 GER_soviet_treaty_desc:0 "We can pursue a new research treaty with the Soviet Union in order to develop, chiefly, better tanks.

 GER_mol_rib_pact:0 "Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"
 GER_mol_rib_pact_desc:0 "A treaty of friendship and non-aggression with the USSR might turn the stomach, but it will allow their precious oil to keep flowing into Germany.

 GER_turkey_puppet:0 "Puppet Turkey"
 GER_turkey_puppet_desc:0 "Turkey is caught in a vice between us and the Soviet Union. If pressured, the Turks will most likely submit to our will and become a puppet state. As part of the deal, the USSR will get some territory in eastern Turkey. However, if they reject our demands, it would mean war."
 GER_rhineland:0 "Rhineland"
 GER_rhineland_desc:0 "The Rhineland has been demilitarized since the end of the Great War, but this insult shall stand no longer! Germany is a sovereign nation and is free to move troops anywhere within her borders!"

 GER_anti_soviet_pact:0 "Anti-Soviet Pact"
 GER_anti_soviet_pact_desc:0 "We can take the Anti-Comintern Pact one step further and ask all members to commit to a coalition against the Soviet Union. If any signatory ends up at war with the USSR, all other members must also declare war."

 GER_demand_memel_desc:0 "The Great War saw the loss of much German territory in the East with the resurrection of Poland and the transfer of Memel to Lithuania. An Ultimatum shall be sent to both nations, but Poland, at least, will likely not bow to mere words."

 GER_czech_friend:0 "Befriend Czechoslovakia"
 GER_czech_friend_desc:0 "The Czechs and the Slovaks are industrious and admirable peoples. It is unfortunate that our territorial ambitions clash with theirs, but it is not too late to pursue friendship rather than subjugation."
 GER_demand_sudetenland:0 "Demand Sudetenland"
 GER_demand_sudetenland_desc:0 "The fate of the Sudet-Germans was one of the worst injustices inflicted by the Treaty of Versailles. They must be brought under our protection, regardless of Czech objections."

 GER_first_vienna_award:0 "First Vienna Award"
 GER_first_vienna_award_desc:0 "The Hungarians were one of the people that suffered worst after the Great War.

We could greatly improve our relations with Hungary by awarding them some territories from Czechoslovakia."
 GER_end_of_czechoslovakia:0 "Fate of Czechoslovakia"
 GER_end_of_czechoslovakia_desc:0 "The time has come to divide the old Czech lands between those who can govern them properly. We should also consider the creation of a separate Slovak puppet state to the east."
 GER_second_vienna_award:0 "Second Vienna Award"
 GER_second_vienna_award_desc:0 "Transylvania has a Hungarian majority and should rightly belong to our friends in Hungary. However, it is hard to say how the Romanian regime and people will react to this demand."
 GER_italy_ally:0 "Alliance with Italy"
 GER_italy_ally_desc:0 "Italians may be untrustworthy - as they proved in the Great War - but Mussolini and his Fascist movement have shown that there is hope for Italy yet. Surely, Germany only stands to gain by allying with Italy, does it not?"

 GER_danzig_vs_slovakia_desc:0 "The Poles stand in the way of our plans for Lebensraum. Still, it is not too late to alter our long-term priorities and seek their friendship instead. The only possible way this could come about is through a trade of territory; Danzig for Slovakia. Poland has already shown some interest in the region by occupying Zaolzie."
 GER_poland_friend:0 "Befriend Poland"
 GER_poland_friend_desc:0 "Although Poland no longer has access to the sea, we have proved our good intentions by giving them Slovakia. Perhaps we can bring them even closer to us by making vague promises of future territorial gains in the east."
 GER_war_with_france:0 "War With France"
 GER_war_with_france_desc:0 "Now that Germany has found a satisfactory solution to the question of her eastern border, for now, it is time to turn our attention west.

 GER_plan_z:0 "Plan Z"
 GER_plan_z_desc:0 "Admiral Raeder believes that the British can best be defeated through a policy of surface raiding. Constructing enough battleships and carriers to accomplish this will be a massive task, and will take time; perhaps too much time... On the other hand, our current surface navy is pathetically inadequate."
 GER_u_boat_effort:0 "U-Boat Effort"
 GER_u_boat_effort_desc:0 "Commodore Dönitz advocates a strategy of unrestricted submarine warfare as the best way of bringing Britain to its knees. With enough U-boats, we might be able to starve the British home industries of all the required resources from its far-flung empire."
 GER_trade_interdiction:0 "Trade Interdiction"

 GER_denmark_friend:0 "Befriend Denmark"
 GER_denmark_friend_desc:0 "Gunboat diplomacy is not dead yet. Our naval expansion plans are well known to our little northern neighbor. In combination with their fear of our vastly superior armies, it should be easy enough to intimidate them into our sphere of influence."
 GER_norway_friend:0 "Befriend Norway"
 GER_norway_friend_desc:0 "Norway controls much of the precious iron exports from the vast mines in northern Sweden. We should intimidate them into 'friendship' with the threat of our expanding navy."
 GER_dutch_friend:0 "Befriend the Netherlands"
 GER_dutch_friend_desc:0 "The Dutch know full well how long they will last in the case of another Great War. If they can be convinced that Germany can seriously threaten Britain itself, it is possible they might choose alliance with us to avoid a harsh occupation."
 GER_sweden_friend:0 "Befriend Sweden"

 GER_first_ljubljana_award:0 "First Ljubljana Award"
 GER_first_ljubljana_award_desc:0 "The hypocritical western powers preached national self-determination while handing over many minorities to be ruled by the Serbs.

 GER_weserubung_desc:0 "Norway is a critical strategic point and would be an obvious point of attack for any enemy wanting to disrupt our steel trade with Sweden. We cannot risk our enemies setting up bases in this region. To obtain a good staging area for the invasion of Norway we need to move on Denmark first."
 GER_around_maginot:0 "Around Maginot"
 GER_around_maginot_desc:0 "If we want to ensure a tactical advantage against France we need to be able to hit them from all sides. They will not expect an attack from the North, which is exactly where we will hit them from, once we've disposed of a few obstacles."
