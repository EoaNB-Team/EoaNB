phl_rebellion.1.t:0 "The Second American Revolution"
phl_rebellion.1.desc:0 "Today begins an uphill battle. One that will decide whether or not America will be the shining beacon of democracy, of humanity, that it was always destined to be. We fight an enemy that overwhelms us in strength and numbers. However, one thing they cannot match us is in resolve. Throughout the streets of Philadelphia, while we are outnumbered and outgunned, the people are chanting a creed not used since the days of the first Revolution, a creed chanted to declare that we would not bow to empires:"

Many advisors are practically begging that we enlist the help of someone so experienced as an officer in one of the most widely admired armies in the world. Some, however, are worried that the enlistment of such a guy may lay the foundations of a vanguard communist party that could threaten the individualist ideals of the Revolution."

No doubt, the bourgeoise who fled are already working with the government of [ASA.GetNameDef] to undermine and eventually destroy the Revolution. We are surrounded by enemies on all sides...and there may even be some within. Bourgeoise oppressors who are faking their loyalty to the Revolution just to bide their time. We need to root out reactionaries at home and defend from them abroad."
