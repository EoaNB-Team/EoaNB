    russia.6.d:0 "Prices for alcohol always were relatively small in Russia from the times of Ivan IV. But with time that prices increased more and more. Nearly in 1830-1840 years prices have risen to 2-3 rubles per bucket of vodka. This money is also a price for a calf.\nNow it became even worse, as prices for vodka have risen three times as large as they were in 1850 year. This is because Russia needs to replenish depleted budget after Crimean War, but also it causes instability in our states, especially among the poor. Protests against that policy originally started in Kovno Governorate, in Lithuania, where local villagers took oaths to abstain from drinking any high-degree alcohol except for "medicinal purpose". However, wine and beer are still permitted. Locals, supported by the Catholic clergy, established chapters of the Brotherhood of Sobriety, a temperance society that originated in Silesia and has support from the Pope himself. That was in the end of the 1858 year\nFew months ago the situation has became even worse - peasants all around the Empire are taking oaths of abstention from vodka. Boycotts were in 91 uyezds (area that is part of governorate) of 32 governorates. Sales of alcohol dramatically decreased, with vodka prices dropped in 16-20 times and retailers sometimes offering vodka for free. Now members of temperance societies attack taverns and destroy alcohol stockpiles. This is going beyond the borders of good and bad..."

Crises, wars and industrial advancements have changed the world and Russia as well. Now soul tax became mostly obsolete even in modernized state. That's why the government wanted to discuss about it with respective zemstvas of the Russian governorates. One half of them were supporting graduated from lower to higher people income tax which will be levied upon all the population and will leave the tax income to the state budget the same, but peasants and citizens will live better in cost of some nobility cashes. Some other commissions supported the usual income tax, but only for merchants, and some additional taxes on nobility and peasants. That was quite a crazy and ineffective idea and no one in the government supported it. Also there was one more proposal - property taxes instead of both soul and income taxes. If you have much property but low income you should sell some of your things so as to have lower taxes for it. All things will be levied with those new taxes, from spoons to great estates. This is unpopular and very untraditional proposal but it gained support through the economically competent people in our lands. Maybe we should listen to them. Or we can just drop all the initiative and suffer the consequences of inefficient tax policy. Nobility will be pleased with that."

Additionally, a clause was added stating 'Russian merchants in China, and Chinese merchants in Russia were under the special protection of both governments,' removing any trade barriers in the region. Finally, since it was agreed that all lands east of the Ussuri would now be considered Russian territories, our ancient claims to the Island of Sakhalin must be rescinded.

He was still alive. Luckily, at just the right moment, the revolutionary’s attempt was thwarted by the valiant interruption of no other than a peasant-born hatter’s apprentice by the name of Ossip Komissarov, who jostled the revolutionary’s arm just as he was about to fire.\n\nThe assailant, shocked by Komissarov, attempted to flee the scene, but he was immediately intercepted by the royal guard. The guards wrested his weapon away from him, and confiscated what appeared to be morphine and strychnine to kill himself with, along with prussic acid to disfigure his face. Alexander approached the assailant, and angrily asked him “What do you want?” The shocked assailant only mumbled back to him “Nothing, nothing,” before being taken away.\n\nThe identity of the assailant has been revealed to be Dmitry Karakozov, a former student and a member of the revolutionary students’ organization known as the Ishutin Society, led by Nikolai Ishutin. He has been locked away in the Peter and Paul Fortress awaiting his punishment, but he begs for forgiveness and even offers to convert to Orthodoxy."

The assailant ducked his weapon back into his coat and attempted to flee the scene, but was quickly accosted by the guards and taken away.\n\nAs the crowds gathered around to gaze in horror at their wounded Emperor, the guards desperately attempted to disperse the crowds as a carriage rode up to take him away to the Winter Palace. As the carriage fled the scene, the condition of Alexander worsened severely, as he began to cough up blood and grow extremely pale and weak. Although the doctors attending to him tried everything in their power to stop the bleeding, the Emperor took his last breath just as his carriage screeched to a halt outside of his residence.

The war started in the Balkans in July 1853, when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities, which were under Ottoman suzerainty, then began to cross the Danube. Led by Omar Pasha, the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the advance at Silistra. The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts in which the military used modern technologies such as explosive naval shells, railways and telegraphs. The war was one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and photographs. As the legend of the "Charge of the Light Brigade" demonstrates, the war quickly became an iconic symbol of logistical, medical and tactical failures and mismanagement."

The reforms carried on during Milyutin's long tenure abolished the system where children were conscripted, and resulted in the levy system being introduced in Russia and military districts being created across the country. The system of military education was also reformed, and elementary education was made available to all the draftees. Milyutin's reforms are regarded as a milestone in the history of Russia: they dispensed with the military recruitment and professional army introduced by Peter the Great and created the Russian army such as it continued into the 21st century. Up to Dmitry Milyutin's reforms in 1874 the Russian Army had no permanent barracks and was billeted in dugouts and shacks."

    russiabook.1.t:0 "Censoring "Fathers and Sons"?"
    russiabook.1.d:0 ""Russian Bulletin" has sent its new March-April issue to the Censor Department. That would be a usual publication if it hadn't the new Turgenev's novel inside, called "Fathers and Sons". It's idea is rotating around nihilism, an ideology of denial of every authority and even somewhat revolutional! It can be dangerous enough for our aristocracy which already supports liberal ideas. We can give the order - and this book will be completely different, but Turgenev will be completely dissappointed in our government. He is one of the most loyal writers of our Motherland and it would be a tall loss. But what if the go soft with this novel and just let it be? Of course there will be some mimics who will call themselves "nihilists", but... isn't it what we want to make them think? Just ensure that they are loyal, being initiative and innovative isn't a crime in Russia."

But due to the end of the Censor Department, following the new law about press, the real book has been revealed! Now people is blaming us for hiding that "masterpiece" from them. That led to us losing some positions in government and, what is really worrying - "nihilism" starts to spread through our population!"

    russiasiberiancolonization.5.t:0 "'Oblastnichestvo' Rises!"
    russiasiberiancolonization.5.d:0 "When Siberian students, named Grigory Potanin, Nikolay Yadrintsev, Serafim Shashkov, Nikolay Naumov, Fyodor Usov and other ones, came to St. Petersburg in early 60-s, they immediately came up with an idea of Siberian independence or 'at least' autonomy for their region. They returned home in 1863, immediately establishing contact with political prisoners and exiled poles. They were gathering forces and money to incite revolt in Siberia. But at this summer, in year 1865, their plot was uncovered. Forty four members of the group were arrested and taken to prison by the Russian government in May, after watch officers of the Siberian Cadet Corps searched cadet Arseny Samsonov, aged 16, for illicit items and found a proclamation entitled "To Patriots of Siberia," attributed to a collective authorship of G. Potanin, N. Yadrintsev and other leaders of the movement. Now all of them went to various places around the empire, ensuring that we won't hear of them revolting again. Their ideas got some foothold within minds of local bourgeois, but that doesn't matter, because no one questions Russian authority in this land anymore."
