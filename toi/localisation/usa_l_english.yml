 USA_buchanan_address_debate:0 "Address the Debate"
 USA_buchanan_address_debate_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Scott case, long rising tensions between North and South, Free and Slave have been brought more fully into the light. Unfortunately for us, there is practically no chance of the crisis ending on it's own as Buchanan had hoped. Because of this, we must take a stance, as not committing will certainly lead to disaster. This stance will manifest in our cabinet, which we have not yet appointed. In the Cabinet, we can either favor Southern Democrats and the Northerners allied with them, or, we can appoint a compromise cabinet and hope to save our party."
 USA_doughface_cabinet:0 "The Doughface Cabinet"

 USA_covode_committee_desc:0 "The Covode Committee was convened in the House of Representatives to investigate alleged abuses and corruption by the President, going so far as searching for grounds to Impeach the President and remove him from office. Though ultimately unsuccessful it served as a lightning rod for intra-party disagreements within the democratic party which ultimately potentially contributed to Buchanan's chosen sucessor coming in 3rd for the popular vote later that year."
 USA_buchanan_successor:0 "Buchanan's Successor?"
 USA_buchanan_successor_desc:0 "Now has come the time to choose who shall be the chosen democratic candidate to square off against the Unionist Party under Bell, and Republican Party under Lincoln, both of whom are strong contenders. We must choose a candidate best suited for this challenge."

 USA_democrat_judicial:0 "Democrat Judicial"
 USA_democrat_judicial_desc:0 "Appointing solely Southern Democrats to the bench would best protect the cause of Slavery, but it would hurt our support amongst the northerners. We should be open to appointing worthy northerners so we appear unbiased."

 USA_mormon_alaska_desc:0 "One of Buchanan's strangest ideas was an early purchase of Russian Alaska, with the intent of offering it to the Mormon Church, potentially seeing this as a clever way of both gaining land and settlers for a harsh frontier, and the Mormon's potentially would've taken such an offer, in their continual pursuit of lands where they could be left alone without threat of violence. We should see if the Russians at this time are prepared to part with such a barren waste."

 USA_utah_war_start.1.t:0 "The Utah War"
 USA_utah_war_start.1.d:0 "The Utah War, also known as the Mormon War for the the participation of the Mormon Church, was a brief period of political instability between the Utah Territorial Government and the US Federal Government. There were many causes, including a long history of religious oppression against the Mormon people, including being driven out of more eastern states by state-sanctioned violence, the duality of governance in the territory between the federally directed government and the ecclesiastic fovernment of the church, and by a gross ineptitude of communication and mistrust between both sides. The actual start of the conflict started when newly elected James Buchanan appointed a new governor for the territory, replacing the then current governor who was also the head of the Mormon Church, and dispatching a military escort with policing powers. The Mormons feared a new wave of federal persecution, and so refused to admit the new governor to the territory without conflict. Historically both sides eventually reached a diplomatic settlement that saw the Mormons' rights, never in real danger, respected, and federal authority respected and transition of power to a new governor."
 USA_utah_war_start.1.a:0 " \"Choose The Right!\""
 USA_utah_war.1.t:0 "Buchanan Revokes New Governor!"
 USA_utah_war.1.d:0 "Buchanan, seeing how unpopular replacing Governor Brigham Young with Alfred Cumming, has decided to rescind the replacement altogether. The President's own party sees this quick cave to Mormon pressure as an embarrassment, and isn't expected to resolve the crisis alone either."
 USA_utah_war.1.a:0 "What was he thinking?"
 USA_utah_war.2.t:0 "Buchanan Revokes Posse Commitatus!"
 USA_utah_war.2.d:0 "Buchanan, seeing how sending a military force would only inflame tensions, and acting as Commander-In-Chief, has recalled the regular army units originally sent to escort the new governor, they will return to Kansas to continue trying to keep order amidst the civil unrest there. From what we've heard of the Mormons preperations for their defense, this will surely lead to our replacement Governor's capture or worse, and certainly an embarrassment for the current administration. Memebers of Congress have already sent us official notes asking for us to defend government officials in executing their lawful duties from insurrectionists."
 USA_utah_war.2.a:0 "We must trust in diplomacy only now."
 USA_utah_war.3.t:0 "Buchanan Dispatches A Small Military Escort"
 USA_utah_war.3.d:0 "After consulting with the Secretary of War and other high ranking officers of the US Army concerning current military committments, the President has decided to dispatch a relatively small military escort."
 USA_utah_war.3.a:0 "We must hope this is enough."
 USA_utah_war.4.t:0 "Buchanan Dispatches A Moderate Military Escort"
 USA_utah_war.4.d:0 "After consulting with the Secretary of War and other high ranking officers of the US Army concerning current military committments, the President has decided to dispatch a medium sized military escort."
 USA_utah_war.4.a:0 "Nothing wrong with being prepared"
 USA_utah_war.5.t:0 "Buchanan Dispatches A Large Military Escort"
 USA_utah_war.5.d:0 "After consulting with the Secretary of War and other high ranking officers of the US Army concerning current military committments, the President has decided to dispatch a relatively large military escort."
 USA_utah_war.5.a:0 "We must put this rebellion down somehow."
 USA_utah_war.6.t:0 "Buchanan Condemns Mormon Dissidents"
 USA_utah_war.6.d:0 "In discussions with select members of Congress, Buchanan has spoken at great length how Mormon dissedents are no different from other great traitors from US history like Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr (look it up). If it was the President's aim to calm tensions, at least part of that progress has been lost, however members of the president's party have been impressed by the President's resolve."
 USA_utah_war.6.a:0 "A slip of the tongue, nothing more!"
 USA_utah_war.7.t:0 "Buchanan Pardons Dissenters!"
 USA_utah_war.7.d:0 "President Buchanan has preemptively pardoned those who are ralling to defend themselves from what they view as Government aggression. Such a broad blanket pardon has proved politically unpopular, but the Mormons are at least somehwat reassured the President does not want them viewed as criminals."
 USA_utah_war.7.a:0 "Let us hope they are not emboldened to rebel."
 USA_utah_war.8.t:0 "Captain Van Vliet Arrives in Salt Lake City!"
 USA_utah_war.8.d:0 "Captain Van Vliet is a quartermaster for the US Army, specifically the part of the US Army sent to escort Governor Alfred Cumming. Upon his arrival in the city, he was immediately granted a private audience with Brigham Young who questioned him on the current crisis. The captain's calm reassurance regarding the troops explicit \"Self-defense only\" orders and that this was only a routine change in governors which, while potentially politically motivated, was not part of an anti-Mormon plot. While mildly reassured, the city remains on edge and the Governor has declared martial law."
 USA_utah_war.8.a:0 "Well-spoken, Captain"
 USA_utah_war.9.t:0 "Buchanan Dispatches Special Negotiator!"
 USA_utah_war.9.d:0 "The President had dispatched a high-ranking official of his party to negotiate with the Mormons and try and make them see reason. However it seems this party loyalist was perhaps too loyal. Instead of trying to reassure the locals, he insulted them, and then made . . . indiscreet remarks concerning Easterner opinions on Mormon religious beliefs. To say this individual's stay in the Utah Territroy was brief is putting mildly."
 USA_utah_war.9.a:0 "You had one job! ONE!"
 USA_utah_war.10.t:0 "Buchanan Dispatches Special Negotiator!"
 USA_utah_war.10.d:0 "In this time of crisis, a private citizen has reached out to us, an individual by the name of Thomas L. Kane. They have worked closely with Mormons in the past, helping them migrate to more remote lands out west where they would be safer from religious persecution, and is thus fondly remembered by the Mormon people. They had volunteered to meet with the Mormon leadership to negotiate asettlement or start a peace process, or help in someway that war be prevented. After traveling south across teh gulf of mexico, across the Trans-Panamanian Railway, and North up the Pacific Coast, landing in California, and making their way East across the Rocky Mountains, they have met with both Brigham Young and the Commander of the US Army escort and Governor Alfred Cummings. He has negotiated as a start to the peace process the admittance of Cummings to the territory, his safety guaranteed, and an end to the Mormon's Fabian tactics while the peace process continues to develop."
 USA_utah_war.10.a:0 "In Verba, Pacis"
 USA_utah_war.11.t:0 "Buchanan Re-Routes Mapping Expedition"
 USA_utah_war.11.d:0 "An expedition under one Lt. Ives was recently dispatched to explore the navigability of the Colorado River. However with this crisis upon us, President Buchanan and the War Department have seen refit to redefine his mission to explore how feasible attacking Utah from the south is. To make a long story short, his mission has been discovered by the Mormons, further raising tensions, despite a technical failure of the mission to find a navigable-enough route."
 USA_utah_war.11.a:0 "Perhaps a subtler approach is called for"
 USA_utah_war.12.t:0 "President Buchanan's Folly"
 USA_utah_war.12.d:0 "The President has today proposed what he calls \"Killing several birds with one stone!\" a scheme, yes SCHEME, so seemingly ludicrous . . . it might work? Consider this, Buchanan is openly expansionist and wants to see the US' borders grow; The Mormons moved to desolate Utah with the explicit purpose of minimizing contact with the outside world; AND, in the wake of the Crimean War the Russian Empire has many debts to pay and has never viewed their colony in Alaska as particularly worthwhile, hosting only a small sealing outpost, and would rather profit off its sale than see it fall to its arch-rival Britain in a theoretical next war. With all this in mind, Buchanan has proposed buying Alaska from Russia, and offering it as a settlement to the Mormons, not as a banishment, but additional land which they might secure themselves in. Russia gets its money, the Mormons get a guaranteed haven, and Buchanan grows the US with ready settlers."
 USA_utah_war.12.a:0 "Buchanan, Winning so much we're tired of it"
 USA_utah_war.13.t:0 "Buchanan Guarantees Religious Equality"
 USA_utah_war.13.d:0 "Today Buchanan, seeking to calm tensions, has issued an executive order directing that, while already guaranteed freedom of religion under the 1st Amendment, federal officials must seek to ensure people of all religions are treated and protected equally under the law. (This will later be codified in a certain 14th amendment)"
 USA_utah_war.13.a:0 "Lady Justice must be Blind!"
 USA_utah_war.14.t:0 "President Buchanan Orders Ecclesiastic Courts Closed!"
 USA_utah_war.14.d:0 "Part of the underlying issues that led to this crisis was the dual-administration of both ecclesiatic and secular bodies, Mormon leaders would advise all adherents to seek justice within the confines of the church instead of in a court of law. Buchanan today demanded that part of any peace agreement must be a close of these ecclesiastic courts."
 USA_utah_war.14.a:0 "Justice in Man's Court, not God's"
 USA_utah_war.15.t:0 "Buchanan Closes the Borders of Utah Territory!"
 USA_utah_war.15.d:0 "Today the President closed the borders of the Utah Territories, still de-jure under his control, in an attempt to prevent the Mormon people from receiving assistance from their network of missionaries abroad and more locally from sympathizers in other states. Some question whether the constitution provides for such authority and legal action has already been initiated by private citizens."
 USA_utah_war.15.a:0 "What's next, Habeus Corpus?"
 USA_utah_war.16.t:0 "Buchanan Demands the Nauvoo Legion Disband!"
 USA_utah_war.16.d:0 "The Nauvoo Legion, the militia theoretically comprised of every able-bodied male of the Mormon Church, was first formed when the church was centered in Illinois, and in close contact with hostile Christians of other denominations. Brigham Young has reactivated the unit to defend the territory during this crisis, but President Buchanan has demanded it disband before any conclusion to the crisis can occur. The President's party appreciates such a bold move."
 USA_utah_war.16.a:0 "What does Nauvoo even mean?"
 USA_utah_war.17.t:0 "Buchanan Pressures Native Tribes!"
 USA_utah_war.17.d:0 "The President has begun a secret campaign of pressuring the various native tribes surrounding the Utah Territory to harass the Mormons to draw away some of their forces from harassing Federal forces in the area. Some of the tribes have members who are friends with the Mormons, and so word has gotten back to them about the President's efforts."
 USA_utah_war.17.a:0 "Probably wouldnt have worked either"
 USA_utah_war.18.t:0 "Buchanan Orders Troops to Echo Canyon"
 USA_utah_war.18.d:0 "Buchanan has been aware for some time about the Mormons building defenses in Echo Canyon, a short ways north of Salt Lake City and on a direct route to the city. The ongoing crisis, which has battered his administration, has finally pushed him to drastic action. He has ordered Federal Troops to escort the new Governor to Salt Lake City through Echo Canyon, and although they are ordered not to shoot first, accidents can happen in tense situation. Either they or the Mormons will shoot, and this crisis has yet to reach its climax."
 USA_utah_war.18.a:0 "How can this solve anything?"
 USA_utah_war.19.t:0 "Buchanan Orders Troops to Avoid Mormon Defenses!"
 USA_utah_war.19.d:0 "Because of the Mormons openly fortifying the pass at Echo Canyon, Buchanan has ordered troops to find another entrance into the Utah Territory. Because of the constant harrassment of troops, scarce supplies, and shifting weather, it is not expected that thye will be sucessful before the situation changes in another way."
 USA_utah_war.19.a:0 "Let us hope they are not needed"
 USA_utah_war.20.t:0 "Buchanan Increases Military Escort!"
 USA_utah_war.20.d:0 "Based on the changing situation out west, Buchanan has decided to dispatch more troops to reinforce those already in the area."
 USA_utah_war.20.a:0 "Let us hope they are not needed"
 USA_utah_war.21.t:0 "Buchanan Increases Military Escort!"
 USA_utah_war.21.d:0 "Based on the changing situation out west, Buchanan has decided to dispatch a large body troops to reinforce those already in the area."
 USA_utah_war.21.a:0 "This will only raise tensions!"
 USA_utah_war.22.t:0 "Buchanan Decreases Military Escort!"
 USA_utah_war.22.d:0 "Based on the changing situation out west, Buchanan has decided to recall some troops from the Utah Territories Expedition."
 USA_utah_war.22.a:0 "Hopefully this will calm tensions!"
 USA_utah_war.23.t:0 "Buchanan Decreases Military Escort!"
 USA_utah_war.23.d:0 "Based on the changing situation out west, Buchanan has decided to recall a large body of troops from the Utah Territories Expedition."
 USA_utah_war.23.a:0 "Hopefully this will calm tensions!"
 USA_utah_war.24.t:0 "Buchanan Promises Statehood!"
 USA_utah_war.24.d:0 "President Buchanan has decided to employ another negotiating tactic to further ease tensions with the Mormons. He has decided to offer them an expedited path to Statehood. This is likely to prove enticing to the Mormons, because of they are granted statehood, Governors will be decided by local election instead of federal appointment."
 USA_utah_war.24.a:0 "Another star on the flag?"

 USA_utah_war.93.t:0 "US Army Successfully Forces Echo Canyon!" #US wins border war
 USA_utah_war.93.d:0 "Despite the thousands of defenders and fortifications, our boys in blue carried the day, driving the Nauvoo Legion before them, and capturing Salt Lake City. Though the Mormon Leadership has escaped for now, and the Nauvoo Legion is not yet destroyed, there is now no way to prevent US forces from entering the territory and taking it by storm."
 USA_utah_war.94.t:0 "US Army Fails To Take Echo Canyon!"
 USA_utah_war.94.d:0 "Despite superiority of numbers for the US Army, the Mormon defenses are revealed to be the deciding factor! The US Army has been stopped cold by the Nauvoo Legion, and a severe shift in tensions has occured because of this outbreak of hostilities. If a peaceful solution isnt found soon, outright war could break out, and it is not clear now if we could win."
 USA_utah_war.94.a:0 "Dev here, asking how did you manage to F that up?"
 USA_utah_war.95.t:0 "Victory In Utah!"
 USA_utah_war.95.d:0 "After a period of military action and confrontations between the US Army and the Nauvoo Legion, the US has emerged victorious, though politically embarrassed. This whole situation could've been avoided but for now the US must work to forcefully reintegrate the territory by force with a restive local population."
 USA_utah_war.95.a:0 "Vae Victus"
 USA_utah_war.96.t:0 "Us Gives Up On Utah"
 USA_utah_war.96.d:0 "Despite the eruption of hostilities recently between the Mormon Church and the Federal Government, and the apparent disparity of forces involved, the US government has essentially given up. Be it military failures or a new political strategy, they seem to have decided they will no longer pursue the reintegration of Utah by force at this time. The people of Utah might feel safe for now but how long can this peace last?"
 USA_utah_war.96.a:0 "As long as it can. But seriously, how did you fail so hard?"
 USA_utah_war.97.t:0 "US Loses Control of Utah!"
 USA_utah_war.97.d:0 "The relationship between Brigham Young's Territorial Government and that of the Federal Government has deteriorated to the point where the Federal Government can't really call itself in control of Utah anymore!"
 USA_utah_war.97.a:0 "Disaster! A solution must be found!"
 USA_utah_war.98.t:0 "Rising Tensions!"
 USA_utah_war.98.d1:0 "The ongoing crisis in Utah is inflaming tensions, we must take action to make sure it doesnt get out of hand!"

 USA_utah_war.98.e:0 "Peace At Last!"
 USA_utah_war.99.t:0 "An End To the Utah Crisis!"
 USA_utah_war.99.d1:0 "But a beginning of the Utah War! Whether by administraive stragety or ineptitude, relations have broken down between the Mormon Leadership and the US government and now people on both sides are shooting at eachother!"
 USA_utah_war.99.d2:0 "After lengthy negotiations and compromises on both sides, there is finally Peace in Utah! Alfred Cummings will assume the Governorship of the Utah Territory, the rights of the Mormons will be respected, and Federal forces will enter the territory to assume their policing duties, and to guard against native attacks. While some still mutter about \"Buchanan's Blunder\" they will now have to be satisfied with muttering as this is a great accomplishment for the administration!"

They are also dealing with some sort of rebellion in one of their territories and see this as an oppurtunity to get rid of the trouble-makers.

As a staunch believer of Manifest Destiny, he cheered the Mexican Cession which resulted in the US annexing much of Mexico in the 1840s. Now he wishes to purchase the Island of Cuba from the Spanish Government, not only to expand America, but also to add another potential slave state to the US to grow support for slavery in the US Senate. However this will undoubtedly be incredibly expensive, as the island is incredibly profitable and Spain is in dire financial straits and sees the island as their one reliable source of income."

POLITICS_JAMES_BUCHANAN_DESC:0 "President James Buchanan, a member of the Democratic Party, is the current leader of the executive branch. He rose to power by defeating former president Franklin Pierce, Senator Stephen A. Douglas, and Lewis Cass in the Democratic National Convention as well as beating John C. Frémont of the Republican party and former president Millard Filmore of the Know Nothing party in the general election. He has a long political history, starting as a state Assemblyman in Pennsylvania, then going to represent his state in congress, before being appointed as the Secretary of State under James K. Polk’s presidency. Although born in a free state, his views align heavily with southern principles, thus many anti-slavery northerners refer to him as a doughface politician. He is a staunch believer in state’s rights, and a hawkish expansionist."
