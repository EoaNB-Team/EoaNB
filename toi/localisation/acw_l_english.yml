The regionalism of the states seperated them from each other, creating rivalries between themselves. This tore into the young republic, as states refused to pay taxes and the army was threatening to mutiny. Many consider it a miracle that our nation survived such times, and it was because of the disposal of the Articles of Confederation, and its replacement by the Constitution. \n \nHowever, it would be an incorrect statement to say the regionalist ideals died out. Many within the country first consider themselves of their state, secondly of their region, and thirdly as an American. Some still see us as more of an Alliance, rather than a nation. After all, it is not 'the' United States, it is 'these' United States."

It appears as though the populace of the city had gone along with him in a joking mindset, but of which is slowly beginning to morph into serious devotion. \n \nHe holds no close ties to the Military, so we can easily choose to ignore him. However, such a bold move by one man that is beginning to be taken seriously by the people of his hometown is beginning to represent the forgotten legitimacy of the Federal Government during this time of crisis."
