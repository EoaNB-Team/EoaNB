prussia.12.a:0 "What a shame..."
prussia.12.b:0 "They will pay for that!"
prussia.13.t:0 "The End of Neuchatel Crisis"
prussia.13.d:0 "Our relationship with the Principality of Neuchatel has been...strained, over the previous century. We came to own it in 1707, and, over the next century, it switched hands between us and the French twice. In 1815, Frederick William III of Prussia decided to allow the small Principality to join the Swiss Confederation while still remaining under our effective control. Yet, in 1848, those ungrateful dogs revolted against our rule! Since then, we have been pressing our claim to the region. We finally thought the Swiss might concede, as Neuchatel monarchists loyal to the Prince revolted, but, with the support of the British, they rebutted our claim. We are forced to allow the independence of this small province."
prussia.13.a:0 "This shame upon the honor of the Kingdom of Prussia shall not be forgotten."

prussia.16.t:0 "Idstedt Lion"
prussia.16.d:0 "A few years ago, the Danes built a statue of lion in Flensburg, commemorating their victory over German forces in the First Schleswig War. Now that we control Flensburg, perhaps it's time to get rid of this symbol of a German defeat?"

prussia.16.b:0 "Let the statue be"
prussia.17.t:0 "Heydt's Rescript"
prussia.17.d:0 "Recently, doctor Robert Avé-Lallemant came back from his journeys in Brazil. While this in itself is quite positive news, the news he bears aren't that good. Germans who decided to emigrate to Brazil are being exploited by fazendeiros, all-powerful owners of coffee plantations. They lack food, medical care, and due to nature of the system they were tricked into, they constatnly fall deeper and deeper into debts. As Avé-Lallemant put it, it is a human butchery. We must act, therefore we shall disallow any emigration for recruitment to Brazil"
prussia.17.a:0 "It is the only reasonable choice"
prussia.18.t:0 "DEBUG: Hidden Event; Prussia; id #18"

prussia.23.t:0 "The Coronation of Wilhelm I"
prussia.23.d:0 "Following the mourning of the death of Friedrich Wilhelm IV, our country now needs to look forward and carry on with the succession by coronating a new king. This has happened earlier today, when Wilhelm I was officially coronated in Königsberg!"

prussia.24.t:0 "The Prussian Postal Service"
prussia.24.d:0 "The Prussian Postal Service has been in operation since 1806, but only as recently as 1850 has Prussia gotten its own Postal Stamps. Now, with the recent administrative reforms and expansion of the system, it is working better than ever."

prussia.26.t:0 "Excavations in Wolin"
prussia.26.d:0 "Rudolf Virchow, an archaeologist from Berlin, has recently begun with the excavation and study of the history of the ancient slavic/viking city of Wolin, which is situated north of Stettin. This may teach us more about our Prussian heritage..."

prussia.28.b:0 "No, we shouldn't trade with them."
prussia.29.t:0 "State Names: English or German?"
prussia.29.d:0 "This mod gives you the option of playing with the German names for the states in the Germany region. Do you want to enable this?"
prussia.29.a:0 "Yes, I want the German names."
prussia.29.b:0 "No, keep it in English."
prussia.30.t:0 "[PRS.GetAdjective] Reserves Mobilizing"
prussia.30.d:0 "Prussia has, throughout history, established a system where the military has a strong, well trained force of reservists to fall back on in wartime. Since we are now at war, it is time for our reserves to mobilize!"

prussia.37.t:0 "Lessons from the Austro-Sardinian War"
prussia.37.d:0 "Both, the Crimean War and the Second Italian War of Independence have proven the deficiencies of our army quite plainly. We need to think of possible reform measures."
prussia.37.a:0 "An's Werk!"
prussia.38.t:0 "Deutscher Nationalverein"
prussia.38.d:0 "The violent aggravation of the Italian struggle for unification sent shockwaves across the continent. Especially in fragmented Germany, the ideals of the nation-state fell on very fertile ground. One of the main proponents of a united German nation was founded in the immediate aftermath of the Austro-Sardinian War - the German National Association or 'Deutscher Nationalverein.' Formed by liberals and moderate democrats, the Association supported a Prussian-led German nation-state without Austria."
prussia.38.a:0 "Von der Maas bis an die Memel, von der Etsch bis an den Belt..."
prussia.39.t:0 "Proclamation of a united Italy"
prussia.39.d:0 "The proclamation of an Italian nation-state greatly influenced the German public. A growing number of people, especially among the bourgeois middle class, wholeheartedly supported the idea of a German national state. If the Italians were able to do it, why shouldn't the Germans, too?"
prussia.39.a:0 "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles..."
prussia.40.t:0 "Preußischer Volksverein"
prussia.40.d:0 "The proclamation of Italy and its subsequent recognition by Prussia once again inspired the German national movement, this time especially among the conservative clientele in the Prussian countryside. The foundation of the antiliberal, conservative Prussian People's Association or 'Preußischer Volksverein' served the purpose of bringing about a Prussian-led united Germany - by force of arms, if need be..."
prussia.40.a:0 "Über alles in der Welt!"
prussia.41.t:0 "Deutscher Reformverein"
prussia.41.d:0 "The increasing political heft of the national movement that supported a Prussian-led Germany without Austria scared a number of people, especially in the Catholic parts of western and southern Germany. Their reaction was the foundation of the Prussian 'Reformverein' that supported a reform of the German Confederation and the integration of Austria. It had little political impact, though."
prussia.41.a:0 "Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?"
prussia.42.t:0 "The New Era Cabinet - Karl Anton von Hohenzollern new PM"
prussia.42.d:0 "With the regency of Crown Prince Wilhelm came an unexpected wave of liberalism in Prussia. The crown prince, who was hitherto seen as a reactionary by many in Prussia, had spent some time at the court of Queen Victoria in liberal Great Britain after being forced to flee from Berlin amidst the March Revolution of 1848/49. The cabinet he installed after acceding regency, headed by PM Karl Anton von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, sparked hopes of a liberal wind of change."
prussia.42.a:0 "Wohlan!"
prussia.43.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (ADAV)"
prussia.43.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. Supporters of the German workers' movement have gathered in Leipzig, Saxony, today to establish Germany's first labor party, the General German Workers' Association or 'Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (ADAV). Headed by a certain Ferdinand Lassalle, the party delegates predominantly support a reformist socialist agenda."
prussia.43.a:0 "Mann der Arbeit, aufgewacht..."
prussia.44.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Vereinstag Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (VDAV)"
prussia.44.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. As a reaction to the foundation of the ADAV, supporters of a different approach within the German workers' movement have gathered in Frankfurt today to establish another labor party, the Congress of German Workers' Associations or 'Vereinstag Deutscher Arbeitervereine' (VDAV). Leopold Sonnemann, Max Hirsch and Eugen Richter are among the leaders of the new party, who - at the moment - predominantly supports a reformist socialist agenda, although the revolutionary wing is gaining power."
prussia.44.a:0 "...und erkenne deine Macht!"
prussia.45.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei' (SDAP)"
prussia.45.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. Following differences primarily concerning the question of German nationalism, the VDAV was split and the majority of its supporters have gathered in Eisenach today to establish a successor labor party, the Social Democratic Workers' Party or 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei' (SDAP). August Bebel and Karl Liebknecht are among the leaders of the new party, who predominantly supports a Marxist socialist agenda."
prussia.45.a:0 "Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt euch!"
prussia.46.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands' (SAP)"
prussia.46.d:0 "The German unification made the most striking dispute between the different German labor parties obsolote. But the unity had been violently crafted under the aegis of the Prussian monarchy and military, thus, the German workers' movement awoke to the danger of being suppressed by conservative authorities. In order to strengthen their political weight, many of its supporters have gathered in Gotha today to establish a united labor party, the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany or 'Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands' (SAP), predominantly supporting a reformist socialist agenda."
prussia.46.a:0 "These socialists are becoming more and more dangerous..."
prussia.47.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands' (SPD)"
prussia.47.d:0 "The Bismarckian Anti-Socialist Laws have proven that the worst fears of the German workers' movement were not unfounded. But Bismarck and the laws are a thing of the past now. The vast majority of the supporters of socialism in Germany have gathered in Erfurt today to establish a newly united labor party, the Social Democratic Party of Germany or 'Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands' (SPD), supporting a reformist socialist agenda, at least for now..."
prussia.47.a:0 "We will have to watch them very closely."
prussia.48.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Freikonservative Partei' (FkP)"
prussia.48.d:0 "Negotiations for a North German constitution have recently started, but not everyone in Prussia is happy with the developments that will most likely result in a compromise to integrate the other states in northern Germany. The conservatives are estranged over the dispute of preserving a Prussian spirit and progress towards German unity. As a result, the party members that support our plans for unity have separated themselves from the traditional conservatives. We can bank on the support of the Free Conservative Party, or 'Freikonservative Partei' (FkP), for our future proposals."
prussia.48.a:0 "Sehr gut!"
prussia.49.t:0 "Rising Support for Political Catholicism - 'Fraktion des Zentrums'"
prussia.49.d:0 "Although we strive for denominational equality, our Catholic subjects fear future oppression. That's why they are starting to tie their political behavior to their belief. Catholic delegates in parliament have taken the first step to the establishment of a political party. They now stand united as the so-called faction of the centre, or 'Fraktion des Zentrums.'"
prussia.49.a:0 "We need to watch the Catholics."
prussia.50.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Zentrumspartei'"
prussia.50.d:0 "So-called political Catholicism is no longer an intellectual subject only. Catholics from around the country have gathered to establish an all-Catholic political party that aims to represent the interests of all Catholics within our borders. Their leader seems to be a certain Ludwig Windthorst from the former Kingdom of Hanover."
prussia.50.a:0 "A Guelph and Catholic? We need to watch them even more closely."
prussia.51.t:0 "Cologne Cathedral - Interior Complete"
prussia.51.d:0 "After more than 300 painful years of standstill at the construction site of the Cologne Cathedral, the final phase to complete the greatest church in Germany had been started under the late King Friedrich Wilhelm IV in 1842. Now, more than twenty years after the cornerstone ceremony of the continuation, the cathedral's nave and transept have been completed, which means that the interior is finally almost fully accessible."
prussia.51.a:0 "Only the Towers remain unfinished..."
prussia.52.t:0 "Cologne Cathedral - Forging of the Kaiserglocke"
prussia.52.d:0 "The towers of the Cologne Cathedral are slowly nearing completion. The construction process already allows for the installation of the primary bell. The king has ordered that the new bell should be forged from tin and bronze of captured gun barrels from the Franco-Prussian War, as a symbol of German victory and unity. After several forging attempts, the massive Kaiserglocke is finally ready to be installed in the southern tower of the cathedral."
prussia.52.a:0 "May it sound the bell for a prosperous future!"
prussia.53.t:0 "Cologne Cathedral - Towers Finished"
prussia.53.d:0 "A day to remember for all the citizens of Cologne, for all the people in Germany, and for all Catholics worldwide: the towers of the Cologne Cathedral have finally been finished. This great monument of Gothic architecture will not only inspire faith in all Christians, it also serves as a demonstration of the German art of engineering, with the roof framework being the largest structural steelwork on earth, at least for the time being."
prussia.53.a:0 "This is worthy of a great ceremony!"
prussia.54.t:0 "Cologne Cathedral - Completion Celebration"
prussia.54.d:0 "After more than 632 years of construction, the Cologne Cathedral has finally been completed very recently. With a towering height of over 157 metres, it currently is the tallest building in the world - and possibly an allegory made of stone of Germany's great future?"
prussia.54.a:0 "Hip, hip, hooray!"

prussiagenerals.1.t:0 "Military Leaders Promoted"
prussiagenerals.1.d:0 "It is our greatest pleasure to promote the following lieutenant-generals to the rank of general: Wilhelm von Radziwill and Eduard von Peucker.

The delegates' main concern is the role of commander-in-chief. Should the head of state also be our highest ranking officer who exercises supreme command and control over the Confederation's armed forces? Or should the delegates be able to appoint a commander-in-chief in times of war? This would likely create friction both with the Prussian and among the general staff, though."

PRS_focus_economy:0 "The Prussian Economy"
PRS_focus_economy_desc:0 "For long the Prussian economy has prospered under its own conditions, but we are falling behind in adapting our economy to the trends of industrialization. A state that lags behind in economics lags behind in superiority; this we must recognize."
PRS_focus_state_rail:0 "Preußische Staatseisenbahnen"
PRS_focus_state_rail_desc:0 "We will subsidize the construction of new railway networks across our country - our infrastructure will certainly benefit from this."
PRS_focus_berlin_anhalt_rail:0 "Expand Berlin-Anhalt Railway"
PRS_focus_berlin_anhalt_rail_desc:0 "The Berlin-Anhaltische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft had rapidly expanded the network of railways within our nation. Originally spanning for a mere 20 kilometers, the Berlin-Anhalt railway project has since connected many places with Berlin, and linked with many other railway lines. Connecting the lines from Wittenberg to Bitterfeld will greatly increase the span of the BAE."
PRS_focus_silesia_rail:0 "Expand Silesian Railways"
PRS_focus_silesia_rail_desc:0 "Expanding the current railway network in Silesia will expand our reach to the provinces of southeastern Prussia, which could be vital should we have to confront Austria one day..."

PRS_focus_trade_and_commerce_desc:0 "We need to support the growth in trade and commerce to secure financial security for our state affairs."
PRS_focus_norswe_zoll:0 "Zollverein Foreign Trade Treaties"
PRS_focus_norswe_zoll_desc:0 "Originally the Zollverein was a customs union intended to connect the German states, remove custom barriers and manage economic policies within its territory. Despite having differences in culture and history, several countries are interested in trading with the Zollverein, and after much discussion it has been agreed that such treaties would ultimately benefit all member states."
PRS_focus_trade_france:0 "Trade Treaty with France"
PRS_focus_trade_france_desc:0 "No matter how we stand with the French, their country is rich, and we could certainly benefit from expanding trade between our nations."
PRS_focus_berliner_borse:0 "Berliner Börse"
PRS_focus_berliner_borse_desc:0 "The Berlin stock exchange is slowly growing in importance. The old venue, however, offers little to no room for expansion. We should find a site for a new building that will represent the rise in esteem of Prussian finance and commerce."
PRS_focus_prussian_consortium:0 "Preußen-Konsortium"
PRS_focus_prussian_consortium_desc:0 "By forming a consortium of the most powerful banks of Prussia, we could dramatically increase the value and security of our state bonds, which, in turn, would give us financial leeway for both domestic and international projects."
PRS_focus_economic_legislation:0 "Economic Legislation"
PRS_focus_economic_legislation_desc:0 "Prussian economic legislation has only just begun to coordinate the practices of trade, commerce, science and industry more rigorously. By expanding, standardizing and centralizing these regulations, we could certainly remove obstacles and prevent exploitation."
PRS_focus_handelsgesetz_law:0 "Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch"
PRS_focus_handelsgesetz_law_desc:0 "While our trade networks and maritime influence is miniscule compared to the colonial powers of the west, the German regions have been structured through centuries of mercantile trade even far before the Hansa. Until now, the exact state of merchants and trade was only vaguely defined or discussed within the government, and with the rise of capitalism and industrialization, our nation now needs to tackle this. The lack of a centralized trade also resembles the disunity of the German states; as the dominant German power, Prussia needs to push ahead. Reforming the drafts suggested in the Paulskirche Constitution should solidify our trade, and unite the German Confederation closer than before."
PRS_focus_borsenordnung:0 "Neue Börsenordnung"
PRS_focus_borsenordnung_desc:0 "With the growth of the equity market comes the necessity for regulation. To prevent economic disruption and to further stimulate growth and stability, we will need to regulate the stock exchanges in Prussia."
PRS_focus_protect_patentordnung:0 "Protect the Patentordnung"
PRS_focus_protect_patentordnung_desc:0 "For far too long, the lack of a copyright law has hindered scientific and cultural advance. Now, advocates of radical free trade are beginning to gather support for an abolition of the Patentordnung, which protects intellectual property concerning inventions. They claim that such legislation hinders economic growth because it prevents inventions from spreading. However, it has been proven in the UK and the US that a patent law actually encourages ingenuity; hence, we must not give in to their demands."
PRS_focus_mining_standards:0 "Preußisches Berggesetz"
PRS_focus_mining_standards_desc:0 "Mining has been a strong factor of German industry and trade even before medieval times, but with the Industrial Era on our doorstep, we need to improve our mining standards. Germany is full of important resources like coal and iron, but the lack of proper standards is hindering our development."
PRS_focus_prussian_industrialization:0 "Prussian Industrialization"
PRS_focus_prussian_industrialization_desc:0 "While the industrial revolution has come to our nation, most of our economy is still being dominated by pre-industrial business sectors, like agriculture or handcraft. Promoting the industrial development of urban regions will surely support economy growth."
PRS_focus_borsig:0 "Borsig"
PRS_focus_borsig_desc:0 "August Borsig has been in the business of mechanical engineering since 1837, his company now focuses on locomotives. He has recently expanded his factories in the northwest of Berlin, and supporting him in his efforts could help to secure a dominant and stable supplier of much-needed railway equipment."
PRS_focus_krupp_cooperation:0 "Krupp"
PRS_focus_krupp_cooperation_desc:0 "The uneasy balance between state and corporate has proved superiority for the companies, as both their capital and devotion to production is far greater than we will ever be able to achieve on our own. One of the most prominent of these entrepreneurs, Friedrich Krupp, specializes in the production of steel and artillery, and cooperating with him will surely not only increase our militaristic capacities, but also reduce our burden in times of war."
PRS_focus_siemens_halske:0 "Siemens & Halske"
PRS_focus_siemens_halske_desc:0 "Werner Siemens is one of the most innovative minds in the field of telecommunications worldwide. In 1847, he established his business with the precision engineer Johann Georg Halske in the west of Berlin. Since then, the company has experienced dramatic growth, and we could certainly benefit from supporting them in their efforts."
PRS_focus_vulcan_ag:0 "Vulcan AG"
PRS_focus_vulcan_ag_desc:0 "Pomerania, along with the provinces of Berlin and Brandenburg around it, stands as an example of great industrial might within Central Europe, but when compared to the world leaders of industrialization, it still has quite a way to go. One promising company from Stettin is the so-called Vulcan AG, specialized in the ship-building industry. Expanding their factories and subsidising industrial growth in the region should increase our industrial capability greatly."
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle:0 "Dreyse Rifle"
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle_desc:0 "Originally developed by Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse in his manufacture in the Thuringian hinterland, the Dreyse needle gun is a promising bolt action breechloading rifle. If we can manage to mass-produce this technologically superior rifle, we should enjoy a significant advantage on the battlefield."
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle_factory:0 "Dreyse Gewehrfabrik"
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle_factory_desc:0 "In order to mass-produce the Dreyse rifle, we will have to support the company in Sömmerda. The developing Dreyse Mill, if subsidised, could eventually produce a lot of firearms for our country."
PRS_focus_spandau_arsenal:0 "Königliche Preußische Gewehrfabrique"
PRS_focus_spandau_arsenal_desc:0 "Originally situated in Potsdam, the Königliche Preußische Gewehrfabrique has been the prime supplier for Prussian arms for quite some time now. The factory grounds in Potsdam have reached their capacity though, and the arsenal and the associated factories have been moved to Spandau for that reason. We will support the expansion of the Spandau Arsenal in Brandenburg, so it can produce more weapons for us."
PRS_focus_suhl_rifle_factories:0 "Suhler Gewehrfabriken"
PRS_focus_suhl_rifle_factories_desc:0 "The small city of Suhl in the middle of Thuringia surprisingly has a rather rich history of rifle manufacturing. The companies of J.P. Sauer & Sohn, C.G. Haenel and Simson & Co. all enjoy a nationwide renown. Investing in these companies could help us to secure reliable and innovative firearm suppliers."
PRS_focus_erfurt_rifle_factory:0 "Königl. Preuß. Gewehrfabrik Erfurt"
PRS_focus_erfurt_rifle_factory_desc:0 "We will try to expand our military industry close to the Thuringian rifle heartlands and establish an arms factory in Erfurt. We hope that the factory site will profit from the expertise and economic infrastructure sorrounding it."

PRS_heeresreform:0 "Heeresreform"
PRS_heeresreform_desc:0 "The Crimean War and the Second Italian War of Independence have proven that our former military might has suffered. Despite a rapidly growing population, our standing army is still the same size it was in 1815. We need to reform the army, if we want to keep our place among the great powers."
PRS_parlamentsheer:0 "Parlamentsheer"
PRS_parlamentsheer_desc:0 "We must strengthen parliamentary control over the military. The law has to take precedence over power, we should reform the army in this spirit."

PRS_roon_reform_bill_desc:0 "Albrecht von Roon has suggested some reforms for our armies. We shall enact them."
PRS_promote_landwehr:0 "Promote Landwehr"
PRS_strengthen_landwehr_desc:0 "The Landwehr has been the backbone of the Befreiungskriege against Napoleon, and it offered great assistance in our attempt of constitutionalization in 1848/49. This is our opportunity to inculcate liberal ideals into the military. This will certainly provoke a conservative backlash, though..." 
PRS_demote_landwehr:0 "Demote Landwehr"
PRS_demote_landwehr_desc:0 "Many members of the Landwehr collaborated with the rebels during the March Revolution of 1848/49. We should demote this unreliable department of our military juggernaut in favor of the regular army. This might be a way to secure both, a majority in parliament and support from the king."
PRS_adjust_draft:0 "Adjust Two-Year Draft"
PRS_adjust_draft_desc:0 "If we enforce the conscription orders more strictly, we might be able to avoid extending the term of service. This might be a way to secure both, a majority in parliament and support from the king."
PRS_expand_draft:0 "Three-Year Draft"
PRS_expand_draft_desc:0 "We need more soldiers, plain and simple. Extending the term of service would ensure a significant increase in manpower for our professional army. This will certainly provoke liberal opposition, though..."
PRS_push_liberal_reform:0 "Push Liberal Reform Bill Through Parliament"
PRS_push_liberal_reform_desc:0 "Parliamentary control over the military is the way forward, the people have spoken. The king may not like this, but he will have to accept the majority decision - or face the consequences!"
PRS_find_compromise:0 "Find Compromise"
PRS_find_compromise_desc:0 "The demotion of the Landwehr and the adjustment of our conscription laws should be an acceptable compromise to parliament and high command. Let's hope the king agrees..."
PRS_enforce_roon_reform:0 "Enforce Roon's Reform Bill"
PRS_enforce_roon_reform_desc:0 "The military is answerable to the king only, not to parliament. These men have proven their loyalty to the crown during the revolution and we will make sure that it stays this way. There can be no compromise here!"
PRS_finish_reform:0 "Finish Army Reform"
PRS_finish_reform_desc:0 "The more detailed reform plans have been carried out. Let's hope they will prove to be effective on the battlefield."
PRS_focus_prussian_navy:0 "Preußische Marine"

PRS_focus_jade_bight:0 "Jade Bight Port Expansion"
PRS_focus_jade_bight_desc:0 "A few years ago, we bought a piece of land from the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg at the Jade Bight, an ideal location for a deep-water port at the North Sea. Gotthilf Hagen has proposed a plan to develop the spot into a proper navy base. It's time to turn the plan into action and start the construction works."
PRS_focus_build_high_fleet:0 "Build Hochseeflotte"
PRS_focus_build_high_fleet_desc:0 "Our navy's obvious shortcomings during the First Schleswig War are proof enough for the necessity of a genuine deep-sea fleet. If we want to be taken seriously as a great power, we will also have to expand our navy to some extent."
PRS_focus_navy_ministry:0 "Establish Marineministerium"
PRS_focus_navy_ministry_desc:0 "Establish a proper administration to manage the expansion of our naval forces more comprehensively."
PRS_focus_ngc_navy:0 "Marine des Norddeutschen Bundes"
PRS_focus_ngc_navy_desc:0 "The North German navy forces must continue to grow, if we want to keep our place among the great powers. The navy of the confederation remains under control of the Prussians, the other member states will have to contribute both financially and with their manpower to bolster our naval forces. A few administrative tweaks could also help."
PRS_focus_war_ports:0 "Kriegshäfen"
PRS_focus_war_ports_desc:0 "With the rapid technological development across all fields of naval warfare, it is of crucial importance to keep up with the times and improve our naval infrastructure accordingly. The establishment of proper war ports at our bordering seas will be an essential step in that direction."
PRS_focus_royal_dockyards:0 "Königliche Werften"
PRS_focus_royal_dockyards_desc:0 "With the rapid technological development across all fields of naval warfare, it is of crucial importance to keep up with the times and improve our naval infrastructure accordingly.

PRS_focus_dissolve_parliament:0 "Dissolution of Parliament"
PRS_focus_dissolve_parliament_desc:0 "We have maneuvered into crisis. Decisive action is required to overcome the political standstill and to continue the army reform. The Prussian parliament is ineffective in that regard, which leads to political problems - we must shake the situation up by dissolving it!"
PRS_king_deposed:0 "The King's Deposition"
PRS_king_deposed_desc:0 "It is time to shake off the shackles of monarchy and take the matters of state into our own trustworthy hands. The king has proven to be unable to reason and compromise. He must go, once and for all!"

PRS_king_abdicates_desc:0 "Tired of the ongoing power struggle with parliament, Wilhelm I, King of Prussia, abdicates in favor of his son Friedrich III, who has signalled his willingness to find a compromise with the liberals."
PRS_focus_bismarck:0 "Konfliktminister Bismarck"
PRS_focus_bismarck_desc:0 "Our situation is dire, the king is slowly starting to lose patience. If we want to preserve the Prussia our ancestors created, we need someone willing to confront parliament - a conservative hardliner. War minister von Roon mentioned a promising candidate who currently serves us in Paris..."  
PRS_befriend_russia:0 "Befriend Russia"
PRS_befriend_russia_desc:0 "The Russians have helped us in fighting off Napoléon, the legacy of the Holy Alliance still subsists between our nations. Having them on our side or keeping them neutral in any future conflict will be paramount to our success. We can also make use of Bismarck's connections with St. Petersburg."
PRS_contest_austria:0 "Contest Austria's Präsidialmacht"
PRS_contest_austria_desc:0 "Despite a rather underdeveloped economy, their internal struggles as a multi-national empire, and their failure in the Sardinian War, the Austrians still claim presidency over all other members of the German Confederation. We are no longer willing to accept this and demand equal status!"
PRS_focus_pressordonanz:0 "Issue the Pressordonanz"
PRS_focus_pressordonanz_desc:0 "The liberal press is undermining the king's authority. We need to put an end to this, even if it means restricting the freedom of the press."
PRS_focus_shut_parliament:0 "Shut Down Parliament"
PRS_focus_shut_parliament_desc:0 "Parliament continues to oppose the budget for the army reform. On top of that, they have repeatedly demanded the Prime Minister's demission. We could find a way to circumvent obstacles in the constitution and simply shut the parliament's doors to avoid new elections. This won't last long, but it would certainly buy us time."
PRS_austria_no_zollverein:0 "Keep Austria Out of the Zollverein"
PRS_austria_no_zollverein_desc:0 "The Austrians have repeatedly asked for their German-speaking territories to be attached to the Zollverein. They try to pressure the South German states into forcing our hand, but we must stay strong and keep Austria out of the Zollverein at all costs, if we want to strive for dominance in Germany."
PRS_convenient_alliance:0 "An Alliance of Convenience"
PRS_convenient_alliance_desc:0 "Our victory in the Second Schleswig War has reinvigorated the German national movement - and Prussia is their biggest hope. Many liberals also want to see Germany unified. Maybe we can use this as leverage to weaken the liberal opposition against our government."
PRS_focus_ask_for_indemnitat:0 "Indemnitätsvorlage"
PRS_focus_ask_for_indemnitat_desc:0 "The army reform proved to be very effective. Our rivals had to sue for peace and we have cemented Prussia's hegemony over Germany. Now it's time to come to terms with the internal opposition. The success of our measures swayed a number of liberals in our favor and we could offer them the promise of a unified Germany. This way, we might be able to divide the liberal movement..."

Together with the Reichstag it will form the two chambers of parliament, the legislative authority of the confederation. First, we will have to decide whether delegates will be paid or not.
