 sepoy.1.d:0 "The year is 1857, and our country has suddenly been ripped into an abyss of turmoil and war. Rising conflict between the British East India Company and our people have led to an incident this morning that has sparked a war: A Mutiny in Meerut. Our country is now in a state of war with the company and on both sides mobilization efforts have just begun. Will this be the war that guarantees Freedom for India?"

 usa.0.t:0 "The Divided States of America"
 usa.0.d:0 "It is a bleak time for the United States. Ever since we declared ourselves independent, we have been plagued by the issue of Slavery. Although the United States would implement policies on Slavery, such as the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807, but even still this institution would continue. \n \nThere were many compromises between the Free States and the Slave States. The Free States were found primarily in the North, which consisted of rockier soil and colder climates. These factors moved the North away from agriculture and toward industrialization, therefore pushing the instituion of slavery out of the North. Meanwhile, the South's warmer climate and rich soil made large, plantation-based agriculture ubiquitous in the region, and as such made the institution of slavery prevalent there. \n \nDebates would arise concerning which states would be allowed to have Slavery, resulting in a power struggle between the Northern States and Southern states, until the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which stipulated that the 36°30' line, which made up Missouri's southern border, become the new border between North and South. States North of this line would be free and states South of it would have slavery. \n \nThis Compromise would be broken 3 decades later, however, with the Mexican-American War resulting in states like Texas and California joining the Union. The size of Texas and the wish for California to become a free state reignited the debate over Slavery. This would lead to the Compromise of 1850, which was devised by Whig Senator Henry Clay and Democratic politician Stephen A. Douglas, and the compromise stipulated the introduction of a Fugitive Slave clause which sparked more tension, as well as the enactment of Popular Sovereignty, allowing for states themselves to choose between adopting slavery or becoming a free state. A notable issue with the idea of Popular Sovereignty arose with the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which led to issues such as the incident known as Bleeding Kansas, where Northern and Southern migrants to Kansas would incite violence to turn Kansas to their side of the Slave Debate. \n \nThe debate over Slavery has taken a hard turn, with the Whig party dead and the rise of the Republican Party, which received 33% of the vote in the Election of 1856, but had still lost the election to Buchanan, a Democrat. \n \nThe future of the United States is in question."

 usa.6.d:0 "Introduced by Stephen Douglas in 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed for the people in the Kansas and Nebraska territories to choose if they would want slavery or not. This has led to many Northern Abolitionists and Southern Pro-Slavery activists to move to Kansas to push for their beliefs in the conflict over Slavery. This has spilled blood many times, one example being abolitionist John Brown who led his sons and other followers to attack farmers who supported slavery. \n \nRecently, the Marais des Cygnes massacre occurred, where Pro-Slavery Border Ruffians killed 5 Anti-Slavery men. With the tensions over the Slave Debate high, this has led to more conflict in the Kansas Territory."

In his memoir before being executed, John Brown wrote: \"I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done.\" In the North, many have started to called him a martyr, while the South is relieved that a well-known terrorist is put to justice."

 usa.9.d:0 "In 1850, in order to deal with the new territory acquired from the Mexican-American War, the United States was divided again on slavery, until it came to the Compromise of 1850. In the contents, it issued many things, such as California's admission as a Free State. \n \nHowever, issues are arising with the Fugitive Slave Law that was enacted alongside the Compromise. Any Slave that flees into the North is to be taken back to their slaveowners. This clause has led to it becoming an issue with the Slavery Debate heating up, and some Northerners have been arrested for having hid runaway slaves in order to protect them."

The Republican Party's nominee is Abraham Lincoln, a charismatic figure that opposes expansion of Slavery. The Democratic Party is split between two different candidates. The Northern Democrats favor Stephen A Douglas, who favors a moderate solution to the Slavery Issue and therefore will likely not receive many votes. The Southern Democrats call for John Breckinridge as the Democratic nominee, who is the current Vice President under Buchanan, who promises to ensure the institution of slavery in the west. Finally, John Bell, an infleuntial politician and former Senator, has taken an entirely neutral stance on the slavery issue and has established a new political party dubbed the Constitutional Union Party, in favor of unifying the divided North and South however possible. \n \nThis may be the tipping point that decides on the issue of slavery. If neither North nor South gets their favored candidate, they may rebel against the current system. But for now, the new President of the United States is..."

It seems as though the only ones that would refuse this were the rich White plantation owners in the South and radical abolitionists in the North, who have lost support when the Referendum had been announced. \n \nThere are four different plans for a Referendum. 1: The Abolition Plan, which, if passed, would ban the practice of Slavery, 2: The Popular Sovereignty Plan, on which people can vote if their state wants or doesn't want slavery, 3: The 30 Years' Plan, where the US would slowly cut down on Slavery until total abolition is achieved in a span of about 30 years, or 4: The Reformed Slavery Plan, which promises to implement a form of Slavery that prohibits harsh treatment of Slaves. \n \nThe time to choose is now, the fate of the nation is in our hands..."

Although this will upset some of the Radicals from both sides, this has drastically calmed tensions on both sides of the debate. It seems like John Bell has brought the nation together, and has finally solved the issue on slavery.

The Government has not been able to properly operate with the death of 3 different executives within days of each other, and many have begun to lose faith in the Union. The Radical Republican, Moderate Republican, and remaining Democratic members of Congress debated how to proceed, they agreed to continue the line of succession, however the President Pro Tempore has come under debate. Many Republicans are unsatisfied with Jesse D. Bright, who was a Democrat, and did not want him to become the next President. Instead, they proposed Solomon Foot as the Moderate Republican choice, and the Radicals presenting Benjamin Wade as a potential candidate, splitting the Congressional halls as they endlessly debated how they should proceed and who should become the next President. \n \nWith the inability of Congress to be able to operate, and protests occurring all across the country, it seems as though the Union's days may be numbered."

But, there are some who have come up with an idea for a new party, the Dixiecrats.

Such an organizational structure requires a certain development environment, which in our case is GitHub. Thanks to GitHub, every dev is able to work on the mod semi-independently. However, having the mod on GitHub with that many devs working on it automatically means that it is virtually impossible for us to regularly update the Steam version on the workshop. Consequently, the Steam version is only updated when major updates come out, being the reason for why EoaNB is perceived as \"idle\" or \"dead\" by many when only looking at the workshop page. Still, what has already been explained on the official workshop page is often overlooked.\n\nIf you want to experience an up-to-date End of a New Beginning, the first step would be to join our official Discord (linked on the workshop). After that, you can look up how to install the GitHub version in our #frequently_asked_questions channel. Generally seen, the GitHub version of EoaNB is way more developed and advanced than the Steam one. Do remember, however, that the mod on GitHub is an in-development version, prone to changes, bugs and balance issues."

 bavariafocus.0.t:0 "Maximilian II Dead!"
 bavariafocus.0.d:0 "Today the Kingdom mourns. As of late, our precious King of Bavaria Maximilian II suffered under a severe illness. After being ill for a total of three days, Maximilian's body could no longer withstand the disease and fell victim to it. Maximilian II, being King of Bavaria for 16 years, died on the 10th March 1864, ultimately leaving the throne empty. This event will certainly influence the very existence of our Kingdom."
 bavariafocus.0.a:0 "May the King rest in peace."
 bavariafocus.1.t:0 "Ludwig II Decides"
 bavariafocus.1.d:0 "As the oldest son of Maximilian II with a right to the throne, Ludwig II Otto Friedrich Wilhelm von Wittelsbach ascended at the age of just 18 years after his fathers death, and is now officially the new King of Bavaria. Seeing as how the young King could be or have been a subject of manipulation from a foreign state, many politicians are worried about how Ludwig could behave in the future. In an attempt to eliminate this risk, a proposal has been made by some of the worried, which would try to persuade the King. The proposal would try to bring Ludwig II closer to his fathers work, and maybe even push for the continuation of the Triaspolitik. However, a lot of people think that this would lead to no result, as Ludwig never was and probably still isn't interested in his fathers work and way of ruling. Whatever we decide to do, this will impact the future of the Kingdom of Bavaria greatly."
 bavariafocus.1.a:0 "We must try to persuade the King."
 bavariafocus.1.b:0 "He's still just a kid. Let him be. This won't change anything for us."
 bavariafocus.2.t:0 "Pick our Side"
 bavariafocus.2.d:0 "We are now at the point where we have to choose a side. The Prussians in the north could be a strong ally, but the Austrians share a lot of similarities with us, unlike the Prussians. If we want to keep our Kingdom, culture and people safe, we have to act now."
 bavariafocus.2.a:0 "The Prussians are different than us, but they'll be a great ally and able to protect us."
 bavariafocus.2.b:0 "No way we will ally with the Prussian beasts. Austria is a much better choice."
 bavariafocus.3.t:0 "Ludwig II Dead!"
 bavariafocus.3.d:0 "Yet again a tragedy hits the Wittelsbachs. Today Ludwig II, the eldest son of Maximilian II, was found dead, bleeding onto the white duvet cover, in his room by a maid, after she seemingly heard some kind of commotion going on inside. After she hesitantly entered the room no one aside from the dead Ludwig was in it anymore. His throat was pierced with a sharp knife or sword. The assassination and its real reason remain a mistery for now, but it is clear that the murder is connected to Maximilian's death and Ludwig's planned ascension of the throne."
 bavariafocus.3.a:0 "Everything went according to plan then."
 bavariafocus.4.t:0 "Luitpold von Bayern Takes the Throne!"
 bavariafocus.4.d:0 "After the death of Ludwig II and the following public commotion, Luitpold Karl Joseph Wilhelm von Bayern felt obligated to restore at least a part of the stability lost because of the lack of a King. As Otto I, Ludwig's younger brother and the next Prince to succeed the throne suffers under a mental illness, Luitpold will act as a Prince Regent for the time being."
 bavariafocus.4.a:0 "This might become a nuisance for us."
 bavariafocus.5.t:0 "Triaspolitik"
 bavariafocus.5.d:0 "The so-called Trias is a try of the southern German states to strengthen their bond and affront the great Germanic powers, being Prussia and Austria. The main contributors to this idea are Württemberg with Karl Augustus von Wangenheim, Bavaria with Maximilian II, the current King of Bavaria, and Prime Minister Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust from Hannover. This idea of a unified coalition in the south again experienced an upsurge in popularity after the German Revolution and is even being supported by France. Following the Prussian attempt at pulling through the Lesser Germany, the Four Kings Alliance became reality, consisting of Bavaria, Saxony, Hannover and Württemberg, which mainly supports the Greater Austrian Plan."
 bavariafocus.5.a:0 "Bavaria should be the one to lead the Trias."
 bavariafocus.6.t:0 "Bavarian Proposal"
 bavariafocus.6.d:0 "Bavaria today proposed to strengthen our bond and maybe even establish an alliance, seeing how the tension between Austria and Prussia keeps on growing. Accepting the Bavarian proposal may have its benefits, but many think that the old idea of the Trias, a try of the southern German states to strengthen their bond and affront the great Germanic powers, would lead to both Austria and Prussia being against us. We should decide carefully."
 bavariafocus.6.a:0 "We should accept Bavarias proposal. Let's grow stronger together."
 bavariafocus.6.b:0 "This proposal will be of no benefit to our nation. Deny it."
 bavariafocus.7.t:0 "Bavarian Proposal"
 bavariafocus.7.d:0 "Bavaria today proposed to strengthen the bond between our countries. While we did not make that much common policy in the past, Bavaria may be a good ally to have. If we were to accept, however, we must keep in mind that we would attract attention from both Prussia and Austria. Let us decide carefully."
 bavariafocus.7.a:0 "We should accept Bavarias proposal. Let's grow stronger together."
 bavariafocus.7.b:0 "This proposal will be of no benefit to our nation. Deny it."
 bavariafocus.8.t:0 "Bavaria Proposes a Süddeutscher Zollverein"
 bavariafocus.8.d:0 "As of late the relations between our country and Bavaria have been developing very well. We gained a few new allies, too, and now they proposed a new kind of Zollverein. Accepting this new South German Zollverein would mean getting rid of the old one and upsetting Prussia. Still, this proposal is not a bad move from Bavaria, wanting to exclude their enemies from the new Zollverein. In other words, Bavaria thinks of us as an ally."
 bavariafocus.8.a:0 "A brilliant idea! This will be of great benefit to our economy."
 bavariafocus.8.b:0 "This is just an attempt by Bavaria to grab more power. Don't let them succeed."
 bavariafocus.9.t:0 "Bavaria proposes the South German Confederation!"
 bavariafocus.9.d:0 "The South German Zollverein became reality and now Bavaria wants to push even further. The proposed South German Confederation is a military and economic alliance between allied German middle states. Accepting it means giving up on getting Prussia or Austria as allies and being on our own. There are two ways this could turn out - either the new South German Confederation is not supported by many middle states, marking its demise, or it becomes the Third Deutschland, the third big power in middle Europe. We do not like to gamble with the future with our country, but in this case it seems to be inevitable."
 bavariafocus.9.a:0 "Our country wants to be a part of this new Confederation. This will mark a new era."
 bavariafocus.9.b:0 "There is no way we will agree. It's suicide."
 bavariafocus.10.t:0 "Bavarian Protestantism Dead?"
 bavariafocus.10.d:0 "Catholicism is a part of Bavarian history and culture. Abolishing it would mean abolishing our culture, and no one wants that to happen. The Catholic Church will be a part of our country forever."
 bavariafocus.10.a:0 "This is for the best."
 bavariafocus.11.t:0 "Bavaria Accepts Protestantism"
 bavariafocus.11.d:0 "Today Bavaria lost a piece of its culture. The state offically recognized Protestantism, making it the state religion. Many are not content with this development, however, namely the 'classic' Catholic Church and conservative groups."
 bavariafocus.11.a:0 "Let us see how this will develop."
 bavariafocus.12.t:0 "Conservatives Resist!"
 bavariafocus.12.d:0 "Following our recent pro-Protestantism policies, a bunch of conservative Bavarian groups have been raising their voices. They demand that we stop 'destroying their beloved culture' and come back to old standards. Whatever we do, we should prepare for the backlash."
 bavariafocus.12.a:0 "Let them scream for a bit and eventually their cries will dampen. We're doing the right thing."
 bavariafocus.12.b:0 "Maybe we shouldn't be as aggressive. Let's do some talking first."
 bavariafocus.13.t:0 "Bavarian Protestantism Fails!"
 bavariafocus.13.d:0 "Our try to officially recognize Protestantism backfired. Many armed groups went on to strike and protest against our recent non-conservative moves. The Catholic Church prevailed and only widened its reach. All this effort - for nothing."
 bavariafocus.13.a:0 "Can't they see that they're destroying our country?!"
 bavariafocus.14.t:0 "Bavarian Protestantism Accepted!"
 bavariafocus.14.d:0 "No one believed this could happen - and yet it did. The conservative groups simply could not get the government to accept classic Catholicism again. Instead, Protestantism now plays a big role in the everyday-life of the Bavarian citizen. Still, the conservative groups refuse to give up on their beloved Catholic Church and the Bavarian people are now clearly divided."
 bavariafocus.14.a:0 "New times require new standards."
 bavariafocus.15.t:0 "Bavaria - A Friend?"
 bavariafocus.15.d:0 "Bavarian advisors and politicians today arrived in Vienna and proposed silent cooperation between Bavaria and Austria, as both of us have something against Prussia, to say the least. While it would make sense for them to ask us to become allies, maybe we should not meddle with the German middle states too much. On the other hand, with some political work, we could get a foothold in Bavaria, possibly making a battle against Prussia easier."
 bavariafocus.15.a:0 "The more allies on our side - the better."
 bavariafocus.15.b:0 "We don't need them."
 bavariafocus.16.t:0 "Bavaria - An Ally?"
 bavariafocus.16.d:0 "Yet again Bavarian advisors arrive in Vienna. This time their proposal is more drastic - seeing how Prussia keeps pushing their demands, Bavaria now wants us an official ally against them, feeling threatened by Prussia. This might be our chance to completely bring Bavaria on our side. However, this might incite the Prussians."
 bavariafocus.16.a:0 "If you think about it, Bavaria is not that different from Austria."
 bavariafocus.16.b:0 "We may have a common enemy, but we can manage alone."
 bavariafocus.17.t:0 "Talks With Austria Going Well"
 bavariafocus.17.d:0 "Today our advisors came back from Vienna with good news. Our proposals to Austria were accepted and the relationship between our two countries is steadily growing. While this is good news to us, Prussia should not be that happy about this development. We should tread with cation."
 bavariafocus.17.a:0 "This will help our relationship grow."
 bavariafocus.18.t:0 "Talks With Austria Continue to Go Well"
 bavariafocus.18.d:0 "And again our advisors come back, bringing good news with them. Austria now officially sees us as an ally after considering the pros and cons of this coalition. As long as our common enemy Prussia exists, this coalition will too."
 bavariafocus.18.a:0 "In these times allies are a must."
 bavariafocus.19.t:0 "Bavaria Wants to Support Bismarck's Parliament"
 bavariafocus.19.d:0 "Bismarck's proposal for a parliament seems to have found some popularity in Bavaria. This proposal is Bismarck's last try to bring the German middle states together and maybe with Bavaria agreeing to it it could succeed. Time will tell, but for now Bavaria seems to have become a little more open to Prussian politics. We could either accept their support, or reject it, the choice is still ours."
 bavariafocus.19.a:0 "It's not too late for them."
 bavariafocus.19.b:0 "They're just trying to kiss up to us."
 bavariafocus.20.t:0 "Prussia Accepts our Support!"
 bavariafocus.20.d:0 "Prussia just accepted our support for Bismarck's parliament. Maybe this will bring us a step closer to a German unification, or at least improve the relation between Bavaria and Prussia. Either way, this is good news, and we can stop holding our breath."
 bavariafocus.20.a:0 "Maybe we can avoid escalation after all."
 bavariafocus.21.t:0 "Bavaria Wants Unity"
 bavariafocus.21.d:0 "Bavaria once again wants to support our deed, and this time it is about German unity. Seeing how a war is probably inevitable, Bavaria wants to support us. While we do not think that Bavaria really wants to go to war, but only tries to gain some allies in case of it, they could be a good ally to have in the south. At the very least the Bavarian territory could be used as a temporary buffer between the German middle states and us."
 bavariafocus.21.a:0 "Very well, there shall be unity."
 bavariafocus.21.b:0 "Nothing but lies. We shouldn't trust them."
 bavariafocus.22.t:0 "Prussia Agrees!"
 bavariafocus.22.d:0 "After some wait, we have received message that Prussia agreed to our support. Now we have a strong ally on our side, but are right between the other German states and Austria, all of whom are strictly against Prussian reforms. Still, we now do not have to fear being alone in the case of war."
 bavariafocus.22.a:0 "Today is a good day."

 bavariafocus.23.t:0 "Military Consultative Commission"
 bavariafocus.23.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results state that there is a high possibility of us surviving the upcoming war if we were to fight on Austrias side, as the latest developments have shown that Austria has a high enough political opinion of us to be our ally. Ultimately we did not learn anything we did not know before, seeing how Austria agreed to all of our proposals. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Austrias side."
 bavariafocus.23.a:0 "The commission is over."
 #(lean Austria)
 bavariafocus.24.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were less clear than we had hoped them to be, stating that while Austria has its differences, it would probably be still a better idea to fight on their side instead of trying to survive alone. The Austrians agreed to most of our proposals, making an alliance in the case of war likely, but not definite. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Austrias side in case of war, but still be careful around them."
 #(Prussia)
 bavariafocus.25.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were surprising, to say the least, with the commission recommending Prussia as an ally. Prussia and Bavaria are not the best friends per se and have their cultural and political differences, but recent developments have shown that the Prussians might not be as aggressive against Bavaria as we thought them to be. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Prussia's side."
 #(lean Prussia)
 bavariafocus.26.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were slightly surprising, with the commission recommending Prussia as an ally in case of war. However, the commission pointed out that Prussia's main goal is to expand their reach, meaning one day they might turn against us. As such we should be very careful when joining an alliance with Prussia. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Prussias side, but still have an eye on their actions."
 #(neutral)
 bavariafocus.27.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were disappointing at most, if anything. Instead of producing a clear statement, the commission could not find an agreement between its members. As such, not Prussia nor Austria seem to be good options in case of war. Maybe we should try to stay neutral, even if that seems unlikely at first."
 bavariafocus.28.t:0 "Bavarian Customs"
 bavariafocus.28.d:0 "Bavaria is a country of culture, arts and customs. With the new Republic established, however, we now have to ask ourselves if this can go on like this. We could try convincing our people to be more understanding towards other cultures and religions, and separate state and religion."
 bavariafocus.28.a:0 "Our customs and culture are important to our people."
 bavariafocus.28.b:0 "Maybe a change of pace would be good."
 bavariafocus.29.t:0 "Bavaria Decides"
 bavariafocus.29.d:0 "With two Kings gone in such a short time and new social ideas embraced, the government is in a turmoil. Now is our chance to form the future of our country, by taking the leashes in our own hands. Before we do any mistakes we will regret doing in the future though, we must first decide how to approach this. We could either try to take over the government from the inside, or call for a revolution."
 bavariafocus.29.a:0 "This is our chance to take over the government without any bloodshed."
 bavariafocus.29.b:0 "There is no way the nobles will give in. The only way is revolution."

 bavariafocus.32.a:0 "Good to hear!"
 bavariafocus.33.t:0 "Bezirksamt Erlangen Established!"
 bavariafocus.33.d:0 "As we have instructed, the Bezirksamt Erlangen has been established. Because of how fast Erlangen, the small city in the proximity of Nuremberg has grown, the Bezirksamt makes sure that we as the Bavarian government have full control over the agrarian culture and industry in that area."
 bavariafocus.33.a:0 "Wunderbar!"
 bavariafocus.34.t:0 "The Culture of Munich"
 bavariafocus.34.d:0 "Since Ludwig I Munich has been the centre of Bavarian culture. The city is the main contributor to the Bavarian image and is our capital at the same time.

 bavariafocus.36.t:0 "Bavaria Wants to Play Big"
 bavariafocus.36.d:0 "Today the Kingdom of Bavaria announced that from now on it wants to play a bigger role in the Concert of Europe, and find its place in it. Seeing how it is the biggest and most influential German middle state, some think that Bavaria's wish to be noticed by others could be succesful, provided they take part in international politics, like the big powers do. Others, however, think that this wish is merely that, noting that the Kingdom of Bavaria never before had any interest in being a part of the Concert. While small countries like some other German middle states seemingly want Bavaria to succeed in becoming more important, the main and long-established powers in Europe, mainly France, Prussia and Austria, would like Bavaria to stay in its current position."
 bavariafocus.36.a:0 "Onwards, Bavaria!"
 bavariafocus.36.b:0 "This is merely wishful thinking."
 bavariafocus.37.t:0 "Bavaria Wants to Play Safe"
 bavariafocus.37.d:0 "Today the Kingdom of Bavaria announced that it wants to keep out of big, European politics. While it wants to still play a role in German matters, Bavaria does not wish to intervene in international ones. This decision, however, does not seem to surprise anyone, especially not seeing how big the main powers, namely France, Prussia and Austria have become. Seemingly not wanting to abandon its introvert policies and culture, Bavaria wants to turn its attention to German areas, instead of trying to keep up with the neighbouring powerhouses that are Austria and Prussia."

 bavariafocus.37.b:0 "A wise decision."
 bavariafocus.38.t:0 "Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal Extended!"
 bavariafocus.38.d:0 "As we have instructed, the Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal has been extended. Finished in 1846 and built during the reign of Ludwig I, the Donau-Main-Kanal has been an important tool for Bavarian trade ever since. With the expansion finished, it now allows us to use more ships for trade, making Bavaria more important when it comes to trading."

 bavariafocus.39.t:0 "Ludwig-Süd-Nord-Bahn Extended!"
 bavariafocus.39.d:0 "As we have instructed, the Ludwig-Süd-Nord-Bahn has been extended. Named after Ludwig I, just like the Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal, it allows for fast transportation between Franconia and Upper Bavaria, even going so far to reach Saxony. After extending it with additional lines, it now grants us the possibility to transport our goods to more corners of Bavaria faster than ever before."
 bavariafocus.39.a:0 "Trains sure are something."
 bavariafocus.40.t:0 "Southgerman Confederation Formed!"
 bavariafocus.40.d:0 "It seems that the Triaspolitik of Bavaria and the other German middle states finally payed off. As of late, the middle states have been making common policy, guided by Bavaria, the biggest and most probably strongest middle state in the German area. Today, after endless discourses and debates, the Southgerman Confederation was born, officially lead by Bavaria. It is advertised by its members as the Third Deutschland, the third big Germanic power, right beside Austria and Prussia. However, it still remains a mystery whether this brand new alliance will bear any fruit and keep up with the European powers."

Remembering the German Revolution of 1848 and 1849, the King thinks that there should be stricter laws to prevent a return of such a movement.

The Fürstentag was initated by the Austrian Kaiser and deals with proposed reforms regarding the German Confederation. The proposed reforms, if enacted, would inter alia set up a parliamentary committee, bringing the German Confederation nearer to being a Federal State. On the other hand, Prussia proposed other plans for the reorganization of the German Confederation. We either could support the Austrian proposals, disapprove of them and support the Prussian ones or stay neutral."

As such, we are allowed to partake in the peace talks. We could try to have a say and get a few advantages for ourselves, but we also could leave it up to the Austrians. However, if we were to take part in the peace talks, we would need to keep in mind that our chance of achieving what we want would be dependent on how much our country developed or performed in the war."

This could greatly benefit our industry, but we should be aware that if the Austrians do not recognize Bavaria as an industrializing country, we would have little chances in succeeding with this demand.\n\nAnother approach would be to just sit at the table, but let the Austrians do all the actual work. Being present at the peace talks and being victorious already makes us quite popular. Additionally, it would not be a bad idea to be on the good side of the Austrians.\n\nThe by far most daring suggestions would be the ones concerning the German unification. As to not be completely thrown aside, we could try to submit some ideas on how the unification should go."

 bavariaevent.9.d:0 "Taking part in the peace talks, [BAV.GetNameDef] today demanded the Ruhr to be officially handed over to them. As we have defeated the Prussians on the field, we theoretically can do whatever we want with that piece of land. In fact, if Bavaria were to annex the Ruhrgebiet, it would weaken the industry of [PRS.GetNameDef] immensely. We could, however, decline and do something else with it."

 bavariaevent.10.t:0 "Deutscher Staatenbund"
 bavariaevent.10.d:0 "As no apparent answer to the German Question could have been found until now, we have to decide what to do for the time being. Unification seems to be a much more complicated thing to accomplish than we thought it would be, and now we have to act before the German states turn away from us.\nMany in our government have come to like the temporary idea of forming a Schutzbund, a temporary, protective federation, to ensure stability and safety along the German areas. It was decided that this faction is to be established within the next days. However, it is yet to be decided how to handle this federation; we could either directly subjugate the German states and initiate the Schutzbund to play safe, or we could create the Schutzbund without subjugating anyone, as that could lead to mistrust."

Every German state would be forcefully annexed by them, to be ruled from Vienna through Munich. If we were to agree to this proposal, German unification would finally be accomplished and we would have full power over all German land without risking too much, like protests in our home country. However, we have to keep in mind that this possibly could be a power grab from Bavaria, even though they have been quite well-disposed towards us."

 bavariaevent.12.t:0 "Bavaria Proposes Unification"
 bavariaevent.12.d:0 "Today [BAV.GetNameDef] proposed the final unification of Germany under Bavaria as our subject. Every German state would be annexed by them, to be ruled from Vienna through Munich, except from the ones who were our allies in the past war. Instead, our past allies, mostly consisting of the southern German states, would be asked whether they would like to become a part of the to be formed German Confederation. If they deny, they will simply become subjects of the new Germany, maintaining their old and rightful borders and territories. It is now up to us to decide whether this new Germany becomes reality, or not."
 bavariaevent.12.a:0 "Bavaria has been a good friend of ours. For a new Germany!"
 bavariaevent.12.b:0 "We have better ideas than that."
 bavariaevent.13.t:0 "The Road to Unification"
 bavariaevent.13.d:0 "The time has come to present our plans for Germany to the Austrians. Still, we need to decide what exactly we will propose to them; on that matter we have two major ideas on how to establish a unified Germany.\n\nThe first idea would be to forcefully unify Germany under Bavaria, while Bavaria itself becomes a subjugated state of Austria. This would make our dream of a Bavarian Germany reality, even if Austria would become our overlord.\n\nThe second idea would be to give the German states who were our allies in the previous war a choice: either they join us and become a part of the New Germany, or they maintain their borders, but are subjugated to us.\n\nWhile the first idea sounds more pleasing, the second one would ensure that no previous ally turns sour on us. However, we should note that the ones who have the final say remain the Austrians. Whether they will accept our proposal depends on how we decided to be seen by the other European powers."
 bavariaevent.13.a:0 "We will unite Germany, even if this could bother some people."

 bavariaevent.14.t:0 "German Unification"
 bavariaevent.14.d:0 "The German peace talks seem to be coming to an end, and with that it seems that Austria has accepted Bavaria's proposal of unification; unification is but a step away. All German states who have been allied to [AUS.GetNameDef] have now to make a decision. Either they become a direct part of the new Germany, or they maintain their borders and territories, but become a subject. As we are one of the past allies, we have to make a choice."

 bavariaevent.16.d:0 "As [From.GetName] today announced, [From.GetNameDef] will hold on to their borders and territories. Instead of becoming a part of the new Germany, they rather would preserve their culture, political system and land, and turn into our subject."
 bavariaevent.16.a:0 "They have to suit themselves."
 bavariaevent.17.t:0 "Germany United!"
 bavariaevent.17.d:0 "Today we received word that the German war between Austria and Prussia concluded in a victory of the South - meaning Austria and it's allies. A peace conference was held, deciding on how to proceed with the German states. Bavaria, the biggest southern German state, proposed uniting Germany under her, to be ruled from Vienna, Austria. The Austrians accepted the Bavarian proposal, seemingly liking the sound of finally uniting the German states, and as such [GEC.GetNameDef] was born. However, as the former Prussian allies and Prussia itself were forcefully integrated into the new country, it is yet to be seen whether this new Germany will hold."

Multiple organized bodies have risen up and joined our army to help us in the defence of Bavaria. Generally, these Freiwilligenkorps are badly equipped, but they will do their best to help us out, understanding that if Bavaria falls, their beliefs will forcefully too. Together, we will stand firm against the Prussian revolutionary, united and arm in arm."

Our economy is in a bad situation at the moment, which would make pouring money into the military look foolish to our subjects. It may be better to fund additional projects regarding the economy rather than this foolish nonsense!"

 aus.1.b:0 "I suppose we are in need of reform..."
 aus.2.t:0 "The Austrian Industry"
 aus.2.d:0 "The Austrian economy is not in the best of conditions. Most of the nation's good industry is packed inside the urban regions of Austria and Bohemia, such as Vienna and Prague. Nearly two-thirds of our population still make a living through subsistence agriculture, most of them Hungarian. If we expect to become a strong industrial nation in the future, it is of the utmost importance that we begin our attempts to spread industry empire-wide, even though we may be unsuccessful."

 aus.8.d:0 "An issue has been tossed back and forth between our advisors for some time now. Some of our more cultured advisors wish to see additional heritage sites opened across Austria - and perhaps even in other corners of the empire. Doing so would likely raise the happiness and content of the empire, bringing stability and peace to our subjects. \n\nHowever, our other advisors see this as a threat to the country's industrialization efforts. Additional heritage sites would cause the industry to suffer to an extent, which could cause us to be unprepared in the next war, which they predict will be won based on who has the best technology and industry. \n\nThe final decision is now up to you, Kaiser."
 aus.8.a:0 "Industry is nothing compared to our nation's heritage!"
 aus.8.b:0 "This kind of thinking will get us behind! Industry! Industry! Industry!"
 aus.9.t:0 "The Situation in The Austrian Empire"
 aus.9.d:0 "It is now the year 1857, and although nine years have passed since the Revolutions of 1848, the legacy of the uprisings still scar the empire. Discontent continues in the regions outside of Austria proper, causing many advisors to believe that the central government may be forced to give concessions to the provincial governments in order to prevent a repeat of 1848. With our former ally, Russia, no longer supporting us, it is of the utmost importance that the sentiment of revolution does not stir again, as the empire came close to collapse the last time it did. Oh, Kaiser Franz Josef! Lead the Austrian Empire to glory, unite its people, and bring justice to its enemies!"
 aus.9.a:0 "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser."

 aus.10.d:0 "The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia and its inhabitants have brought the Austrian Empire nothing but trouble since 1848. The "Risorgimento" movement for Italian unification has been the worst of our worries regarding the Italian region. For centuries, the Italian peninsula has been split between many kingdoms and has been dominated by foreign powers, such as France or Austria. A unified Italian Kingdom would pose a large threat to current Austrian holdings in Northern Italy. Such a kingdom would also be a large threat to the continuation of the Austrian Empire, as it is highly unlikely that they will be willing to ally us. Therefore, we must do anything in our power to keep resistance to a minimum and to keep a unified Italy from coming to fruition."

 shogunate_japan.0.d:0 "Ever since Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Japan entered into an era of unprecedented unity, stability, and progress under his new Shogunate. This era, dubbed the Edo Period after the bakufu capital, would see the beginnings of Japan's complete withdrawal from the outside world, save for brief contacts with China and Korea under the policy of sakoku, or closed country, enacted between 1633-1639. With its strong isolationist stance, Japan was able to resist the spread of Christianity and other Western influences within the country, maintaining its independence, at the cost of sealing off contact with modern innovations, save for a small Dutch trading post in the bay of Nagasaki called Dejima. Although contacts with the Dutch were limited, Japanese scholars were able to obtain a fair amount of knowledge on modern medicine and technology through the Rangaku studies, but the country as a whole still lagged far behind the West. \n \nThis 220-year paradigm, and the peace that came with it, suddenly came to a screeching halt when American Commodore Matthew C. Perry steamed into Edo Bay on July 8, 1853 and demanded that Japan end its long period of isolation and adopt formal trade relations with the US. To back up his demands were the might of his powerful steamships, which the Japanese called the black ships because of the color of the warships and the smoke that belched out of their coal-fired steam engines. The Shogunate, virtually threatened at gunpoint to end sakoku, finally agreed to sign the Convention of Kanagawa with Perry on March 31, 1854. The terms of the Convention agreed to the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American vessels, ensured the safety of American castaways, and established an American consul in Japan. \n \nThe aftermath of the Convention would cast a huge shadow of doubt over the Shogun's historical responsibility to oppose Western encroachment into Japan, and it was the catalyst for the rise of the Sonno Joi movement, or the belief that the Shogun was no longer capable of resisting the West, and that the Emperor should be entrusted with such an important role. With the security of Japan deeply threatened, the Shogunate overturned many of its policies restricting its naval capabilities in 1855, and desperately sought to improve the strength of its defenses as quickly as possible. However, centuries of peace have atrophied fighting capability of Japanese troops, and with growing discontent from the historically hostile tozama daimyo, the Shogunate is quickly approaching its day of reckoning..."

Its contents include an exchange of diplomatic agents between the US and Japan, the additional opening of the ports of Kanagawa and Nagasaki to the existing ports of Shimoda and Hakodate agreed to be opened originally in the Convention of Kanagawa, to be effective July 4th 1859, extraterritoriality rights for their citizens, new fixed low import-export duties subject to international control, and the right of freedom of religious expression to US nationals in Japan. \n \nThese demands are much higher than the treaty signed with Perry in the past, and the sudden introduction of foreigners into the shogunal capital of Edo is bound to cause a great deal of socioeconomic instability. However, we are sadly in no real position to oppose these demands, and if we were to refuse this treaty we may end up the same way China did in their Opium War. Our only choice now is, should we bring this before the Emperor and convince him to ratify the treaty, or is the signature of a bakufu official enough?"

As our Emperor's understanding of these foreigners stems merely from ukiyo-e prints of Westerners depicted as deplorable demons, it is unlikely that the bakufu has any capability of convincing him to open our ports to their traders. \n \nAlthough the Shogun himself could still ratify the treaty, acceding to the Westerners' demands without Imperial support would certainly sow popular disapproval of the bakufu."

 tsushima.4.a:0 "Horrible!"
 tsushima.5.t:0 "The Tsushima Incident"
 tsushima.5.d:0 "Another clash has taken place on Tsushima when a local peasant leader gathered a troop and tried to assault the naval base, where the Russian flag had been raised, earlier today. The leader was killed by Russian rifle fire, and two Japanese citizens taken hostage, as the Russians fended off the assault. This incident has only served to further increase the tensions between us and [RUS.GetNameDef]..."
 tsushima.5.a:0 "How much more must this island endure?"
 tsushima.6.t:0 "The Coastline Charter"
 tsushima.6.d:0 "The Russians have drafted a treaty to resolve the recent crisis over Tsushima - in their favour, of course. The treaty states that they are to receive rights to the coastline of the island (effectively giving them control over it), with the right to build naval bases and dock ships fully included. Our government can say what it will, but the Tsushima local authorities ultimately have the final say. Let us see how they decided."
 tsushima.6.a:0 "The Tsushima Authorities accepted."
 tsushima.6.b:0 "The Tsushima Authorities refused."
 tsushima.7.t:0 "Britain stands on Japan's side!"
 tsushima.7.d:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] has just publicly announced that it is backing [JAP.GetNameDef] in the ongoing Tsushima crisis! This means that if a war should erupt over the island, we will most likely have to fight off the British as well as the Japanese..."
 tsushima.7.a:0 "That is bad for us."
 tsushima.8.t:0 "The Tsushima Authorities refused!"
 tsushima.8.d:0 "The local authorities of Tsushima have refused the Coastline Charter, stating that they will not allow Russian influence on this island, especially by \"illegitimate means\" and after the recent clashes on the island. What is our response to this?"
 tsushima.8.a:0 "We will have to back down then."
 tsushima.8.b:0 "Let them know that we will not back down!"
 tsushima.9.t:0 "Russia has backed down"
 tsushima.9.d:0 "[RUS.GetNameDef] has backed down in the Tsushima Crisis, resolving the situation and restoring peace to the island, whose citizens were already growing more and more anxious with every day of Russian presence. They have now withdrawn their troops and ships from the island, and business is quickly going back to the usual."
 tsushima.9.a:0 "Conflict avoided."
 tsushima.10.t:0 "The Russians refuse to back down!"
 tsushima.10.d:0 "[RUS.GetNameDef] seems to have really set their eye on Tsushima, because they refused to back down even when the local authorities gave them a clear no. Maybe we should just give them the island - or maybe the threat of war will contain their imperialist desires."
 tsushima.10.a:0 "Threaten War unless they back down!"
 tsushima.10.b:0 "If they want it so much, they can have Tsushima..."
 tsushima.10.c:0 "In case the conflict escalates, we will back up Japan."
 tsushima.11.t:0 "Japan threatens us with War!"
 tsushima.11.d:0 "[JAP.GetNameDef] has threatened war over the island of Tsushima in the ongoing crisis after we have announced our refusal to back down! We could recede at the last moment now, or we could try to enforce our will by way of the sword!"
 tsushima.11.a:0 "We will back down then...we can't afford this conflict."
 tsushima.11.b:0 "They can have a war!"
 tsushima.12.t:0 "[RUS.GetNameDef] declares war on [JAP.GetNameDef]!"
 tsushima.12.d:0 "[RUS.GetNameDef] has declared war on the Japanese over the island of Tsushima, which was the focal point of an ongoing crisis which has now erupted in violence! We have guaranteed the Japanese that we are their backers in this conflict - so we are obliged to come to their aid."
 tsushima.12.a:0 "We shall fight them off!"
 tsushima.12.b:0 "We will come to Japans aid!"
 tsushima.13.t:0 "We have lost the war!"
 tsushima.13.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, Russia has been defeated in military conflict! The Tsushima crisis is coming to an end - but not the one we hoped for. Let us hope our enemies have mercy on us...and that that reflects in their treaty, which will inevitably be imposed..."
 tsushima.13.a:0 "A terrible humiliation of [RUS.GetNameDef]..."
 tsushima.14.t:0 "Peace Treaty - open our ports to Britain?"
 tsushima.14.d:0 "Part of the peace treaty signed over the Tsushima War included a section stating that [JAP.GetNameDef] is to open their ports to [ENG.GetNameDef], but many isolationists in our country oppose this. Should we try to break the treaty, or go along with it?"
 tsushima.14.a:0 "Yes, the British deserve an exception."
 tsushima.14.b:0 "No, that can not be allowed."
 tsushima.15.t:0 "[JAP.GetNameDef] breaks the Peace Treaty!"
 tsushima.15.d:0 "The Japanese have violated the peace treaty of the Tsushima War just mere days after it was signed by refusing to let our ships dock in their ports, despite it being clearly stated in the treaty that we should henceforth be allowed to do so! How should we handle this?"
 tsushima.15.a:0 "We have to accept their policy of isolation."
 tsushima.15.b:0 "If they want another war, they can have it!"
 tsushima.16.t:0 "We have won the war!"
 tsushima.16.d:0 "[RUS.GetNameDef] celebrates another victory tonight, as the Japanese have announced their surrender over what came to be called the \"Tsushima War\"! We are now free to draft a peace treaty and begin negotiations."
 tsushima.16.a:0 "A great victory for [RUS.GetNameDef]!"
