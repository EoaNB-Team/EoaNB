While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

 FRA_infantry_equipment_rifle_0_desc:0 "In 1826, the Lieutenant Henri-Gustave Delvigne invented a new method for rifled guns. The chamber of the rifle was smaller than the bore, with which it was connected by a spherical surface equal in radius to the ball used. The powder was poured from the muzzle into the chamber, upon which the ball rested when dropped into the bore. When forced against the chamber rim by ramming (with three strokes of a heavy ram), the bullet would become deformed and flatten, so as to expand in diameter against the inside of the bore, allowing the bullet to press against the rifling grooves. When fired, the bullet would accompany the rifling and spin."

La Mancelle has been the first automobile producted in series (50 copies). Amédée-Ernest Bolléehas also invented Marie-Anne (a road train), La Nouvelle and La Rapide (speed record of 62km/h)."
