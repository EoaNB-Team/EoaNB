 haiti.8.t: "Fabre Geffrard's Increasing Popularity"
 haiti.8.desc: "In 1849 Soulouque became Emperor Faustin I and appointed Geffrard to command a division of the army during the first war against Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) in which Fabre Geffrard gained fame from his victory at La Tabarra. During the second war against Santo Domingo that occurred last year, General Geffrard distinguished himself on several occasions. Particularly for his skillful direction of the artillery in Banico. He was thus titled Duke of Tabarre for his military successes.\n\nContrarily the popularity of Emperor Faustin-Élie Soulouque has severely dwindled in recent years. His popularity dropped as he and his army of 30,000 marched into Santo Domingo for the second Dominican war and upon the first shot being fired, he fled in fear. The people of [ROOT.GetName] are now, more than ever, seeing Geffrard as a possible successor to emperor Faustin Soulouque.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to avoid being replaced, Faustin has conducted a plan to arrest Geffrard before this popular idea gets traction. Though it may be possible to convince Faustin to not go through with the plan. Only one question remains, shall we advise Faustin to move forward with the plan or not?"
