### EVENTS ###
 chile.1.t: "The Inauguration of The Santiago Central Station"
 chile.1.d: "With the capital for the construction being approved in 1855 and investments slowly rising by 1856, the first railroad was constructed, under the direction of the Engineer Emilio Chavier. As 1857 arrives, construction continued under President Montt, finishing in the 15th of September, when the first train finished the Santiago-San Bernardo route. The new station has three structures with 2 offices and 4 railroads."
 chile.1.a: "Our infrastructure grows!"
 chile.2.t: "The Creation of the National Party"
 chile.2.d: "After the high influence of the Church in the government, with the Sacristán Question dividing the conservative party, the government of Manuel Montt and his supporter Antonio Varas, has fallen in support. To combat that, the nationalist and ultraconservatives, have united under one cause, creating the National Party, with a strong executive power, continuing the sponsorship of the church and maintaining order in the collapsing republic."
 chile.2.a: "Will this save the government?"
 chile.3.t: "The Liberal and Moderate Conservatives unite!"
 chile.3.d: "Revolted with the current situation, as Manuel Montt's authoritarian government grows stronger but unstable, the dissident conservatives and the opposition's liberals have formed a coalition from radical liberals, moderates and once supporters of the president, to strenghthen the opossition against his government."
 chile.3.a: "The liberals grow stronger, this could turn out badly, again."
 chile.4.t: "The 1859 Revolution"
 chile.4.d: "Since 1851, Chile was governed by war hero Manuel Montt, who stopped the liberal 1851 revolution and ruled with an iron first, persecuting his opposition and divided his party by sponsoring the Church who demoted ministers which the moderate-conservatives supported. With the polarization with the ultraconservatives making the National Party, the liberal-conservative alliance has made the liberal party, allying with the liberal elites in Atacama, who have risen in wealth during the mining boom, with the radical liberals and other dissidents. The explosion of the rebellion happened with the proposal of Antonio Varas, the main authoritarian figure, as a candidate for president. The opposition orchestrated a coup, leading a revolt around the country, specially in the north."
 chile.4.a: "This is the start of a civil war!"
 chile.5.t: "The 1859 Revolution Fails"
 chile.5.d: "Even with the expansion of the rebellion, the powerful Chilean army under their generals and with the central government's rising conscription, was able to overwhelm the liberal rebellion, imprisoning and exiling the liberal rebels. However, the war has severely weakened our government, as Varas has renounced from his proposed candidacy and the moderate liberal-conservatives are looking for a new coalition-unity figure."
 chile.5.a: "It's over, but this government is falling..."
 chile.6.t: "The 1859 Revolution Succeeds"
 chile.6.d: "In a surprising victory, the Radical Liberals and their troops have swept through the conservative troops, taking the capital in their rebellious acts, as the whole government was taken prisoner by the revolutionaries. Manuel Montt was exiled with some of his supporters escaping as well, as the new government stablises it's position, promising reforms and enormous changes for Chile."
 chile.6.a: "Glory to the Liberal Revolution!"
 chile.7.t: "The 1861 Elections"
 chile.7.d: "The elections have given obvious results, as Varas lost his candidacy due to his authoritarianism and being unpopular with the moderates and liberals. Most of the liberal and conservative groups decided on an unity candidate, José Joaquín Pérez Mascayano, who was able to win the election unanimously."
 chile.7.a: "Long Live the President!"
 chile.8.t: "The Church of the Company Fire"
 chile.8.d: "The Church of the Company of Jesus was a Jesuit church located in Santiago, Chile. The day of the fire was the celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. The fire started at 7 P.M. when an oil lamp had ignited the place and it got fire. About 2000-3000 people inside the church got roasted in the massive fire accident. This was a national tragedy that called for the creation of a national firefighting corps in Santiago."
 chile.8.a: "A national tragedy."
 chile.9.t: "The 1866 Elections"
 chile.9.d: "There were no surprises in the re-election of the extremely popular Pérez, with the Radical Party and the Conservative Party trying to dispute with his National Liberal-Conservative unity, but failing miserably. He was elected with 88 percent of the vote, undisputed and continues to reform and stabilize the nation."
 chile.9.a: "Pérez wins again."
