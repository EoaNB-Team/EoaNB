 hamburg.301.t: "[FROM.GetName] Negotiates Company Partnership"
 hamburg.301.d: "[FROM.GetName] would like to establish a Woermann Traiding Company branch in [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. The negotiation would have [FROM.GetName] pay a tribute to [ROOT.GetLeader] as payment for them to operate and have military access within our kingdom. No doubt this would provide our people with industrialization investments and modern guns. Though some fear that inviting colonial powers will only lead to them taking more land."
