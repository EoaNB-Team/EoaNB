 TSH_vic_reign_in_han_currency: "Reign in Han Currency"
 TSH_vic_reign_in_han_currency_desc: "The Han have long had the permission to mint their own coins and issue currency. With the current situation in mind, however, this right must be recinded to prevent further spiraling of the economy. We shall restrict their currency issuing."
 TSH_vic_greater_control_on_gold_market: "Greater Controls on the Gold Market"
 TSH_vic_greater_control_on_gold_market_desc: "The matters of the economy has long been dealt with by trading guilds and not by our own hand. The current situation doesn't allow for this to continue without state interference, and so, we will regulate economic matters more regularly."
 TSH_vic_international_exchange_rates: "Adopt International Exchange Rates"
 TSH_vic_international_exchange_rates_desc: "The differences between Japanese exchange rates and international rates is what caused this great economic upheaval in the first place. We will adopt international standards, which should stop further outflow of value out of the nation."
 TSH_vic_issue_unbacked_notes: "Issue Unbacked Notes"
 TSH_vic_issue_unbacked_notes_desc: "In order to deal with the economic constraints of our massive gold loss, we may have to print notes that have... questional backing by our financial instiutions."

 TSH_vic_adopt_aratame_sanbu_sadame_desc: "As a temporary solution of our lack of currency following international standards, we will adopt foreign coinage that do! Adopting the Mexican dollar, we can maintain an exchange rate of one dollar to three Bu."
 TSH_vic_adopt_weight_based_system: "Return to Weight-Based System"
 TSH_vic_adopt_weight_based_system_desc: "The blow of the great outflow of gold is still something that the nation can feel, even with all efforts put in place. Returning to the old weight-based system will be more stable for now, but serious reform must be considered to prevent such an outflow again."
 TSH_vic_national_development: "National Development"
 TSH_vic_national_development_desc: "Since the 200 years of peace that followed our victory at Sekigahara, economic development in the nation has not been particularly led or coordinated. Officials have issued public works over the years sporadically and willy-nilly. With the opening of the nation, however, perhaps a more concerted effort towards development is needed?"
 TSH_vic_assist_han_development: "Assist Han Development"
 TSH_vic_assist_han_development_desc: "While the Han can mostly fend for themselves, the string of failures to prevent Western interference has led to extensive criticism and resentment of the Bakufu among our feudal lords. It may be prudent to provide assistance to them if we wish to silence this unjust criticism of our peerless rule."
 TSH_vic_refurbish_the_kaido: "Refurbish The Kaidō"
 TSH_vic_refurbish_the_kaido_desc: "The Kaidō are a set of roads, trails and highways built in the wake of the formation of the Tokugawa Shogunate to tie daimyo closer to the Shogun's rule. These highways have served the Bakufu well, but they are in need of refurbishment and repair in some parts. Fixing and widening these roads would be a good step to get the nation back into shape."
 TSH_vic_focus_tozama: "Focus on The Tozama Daimyo"
 TSH_vic_focus_tozama_desc: "The Tozama are the decendants of the daimyo that chose to oppose the Tokugawa at Sekigahara, and the most vocal critics of the Shogunate's policies as of late. Their discontent is concerning, but perhaps it would be better to reinforce our allies in the Fudai instead?"
 TSH_vic_tie_tozama: "Tie the Tozama closer"
 TSH_vic_tie_tozama_desc: "Now that our focus is on the Tozama, we should make efforts to tie them closer to our rule. Once enemies, but now comrades!"

 TSH_vic_the_shihasho_territories: "The Shihaisho Territories"
 TSH_vic_the_shihasho_territories_desc: "The Shihaisho territories are the private holdings of the Shogunate, and directly administered by the Bakufu. Developing the capablities we have closest to hand is a must to strengthen our own position!"
 TSH_vic_kabunakama_monopoly_question: "Kabunakama Monopoly Question"
 TSH_vic_kabunakama_monopoly_question_desc: "The Kabunakama are the various guilds and merchant associations that represent the merchant classes. For a long time, they have held state sanctioned monopolies and grants over various goods and services. In exchange, a sizable tax obligation had to be payed to the Shogunate for the privilege. At multiple occasions there have been attempts to both question or abolish these systems, but the guilds have resisted fiercly. Another such occasion has come, and it's time to decide if we want to maintain our current agreements."
 TSH_vic_tax_reform: "Tax Reform"
 TSH_vic_tax_reform_desc: "The Kemi system has long been severely lacking in its task of tax collection, mostly due to endemic corruption among its responsible officials. Reforms are needed, but will be lengthy and take time to implement."
 TSH_vic_refurbish_the_gokaido: "Refurbish The Gokaidō"
 TSH_vic_refurbish_the_gokaido_desc: "The Gokaidō are the five largest highways of the Kaidō system of road networks, and the most important in the system. Their maintenance and expansion is of great import, and should be done soon."

 TSH_vic_silk_industry: "Strenghen the Silk Industry"
 TSH_vic_silk_industry_desc: "Besides whaling, one of the most rapidly growing interests of foreign businessmen coming to Japan is silk. Silk is growing quite quickly in demand in the West and elsewhere, and the expansion of our profitable weaveries is required to keep up with demand."

 TSH_vic_recruit_gifted_students_desc: "The Bansho Shirabesho is active in full, but can always be expanded. Recruiting gifted and promising students to learn and study foreign concepts and languages would do much in the effort to expand our knowledge."
 TSH_vic_embassy_to_the_us: "Embassy to the USA"
 TSH_vic_embassy_to_the_us_desc: "An embassy to the US has been called over by the Americans to ratify the treaty we signed with Townsend Harris.

 TSH_vic_first_embassy_to_europe: "First Embassy to Europe"
 TSH_vic_first_embassy_to_europe_desc: "Following the initiative of the US, various powers in Europe have also signed treaties with us that are to be ratified. The contents of the treaties state that we have to open ports at various cities across Japan to service foreign vessels. This clause is problematic in regards to our domestic situation, and as such, we will seek to negotiate a prolongment of the opening date of opening our ports."
 TSH_vic_second_embassy_to_europe: "Second Embassy to Europe"
 TSH_vic_second_embassy_to_europe_desc: "Sonno Joi sentiments have gripped Japan after the Emperors command to expell all foreigners from the nation! An envoy will be sent to Europe, demanding the immediate closure of Yokosuka Port to foreigners!"

 TSH_vic_bakufu_military: "Bakufu Military"
 TSH_vic_bakufu_military_desc: "The Bakufu has been in a 200 year peace, with little much to do for Shogunal and daimyo levies. The army and navy are still based on old feudal practices and levies, and unequipped to face our most recent opponent in the Western Powers. For our own continued existence, reform and restructuring is required."
 TSH_vic_reviewing_the_bakufu_army: "Reviewing The Bakufu Army"
 TSH_vic_reviewing_the_bakufu_army_desc: "The Shogunal Army is still organized after the model as was 200 years prior via a system of obligated levies from feudal lords. To reshape it, we must first get a hold of all army assets and persons that are liable to provide a levy in times of war. Before reformation comes administration!"
 TSH_vic_reorganization: "Reorganization"
 TSH_vic_reorganization_desc: "Now that we are aware of all assets that the Shogun has at disposal for military endeavours, we can now start to reorganize our forces to become better prepared in the event of war."
 TSH_vic_fund_training_schools: "Fund Training Schools"
 TSH_vic_fund_training_schools_desc: "The samurai of old were all trained in the ways of the sword, as well as other courtly skills, at court and at dojo. Times have changed since then, and new subjects in the ways of war must be taught and learnt."

 TSH_vic_rely_on_daimyo_levy: "Rely on Daimyo Levies"
 TSH_vic_rely_on_daimyo_levy_desc: "The Shogun has long been reliant on his vassals to provide soldier levies to their lord's campaigns, in addition to the Shogun's personal retinue. This system may be outdated in the long-run, but tying our vassals closer in a time of strife may be just the thing we need..."
 TSH_vic_foreign_expertise: "Foreign Expertise"
 TSH_vic_foreign_expertise_desc: "While the foreign barbarians of the West are an unwelcome intruder to our lands, they bring with them powerful weapons and the know-how to use them. Contacting and hiring people with the requisite knowledge for modern warfare would do much for our reorganization efforts!"
 TSH_vic_unit_field_training: "Unit Field Training"
 TSH_vic_unit_field_training_desc: "Conversing and reading theory can only get us so far. Field practice and training is arguably the most important aspect of successful warfare, and we should take time to train properly."
 TSH_vic_centralized_army_effort: "Centralized Army Effort"
 TSH_vic_centralized_army_effort_desc: "The armies of the barbarians of the West make use of well-developed hierarchies of command, combined with the use of modern weaponry and crafty field tactics to defeat an enemy on the field. Though these concepts are not foreign to us, the West has refined this type of warfare beyond our abilities. A centralized army following a western model is required to maintain a strong army!"
 TSH_vic_integration_of_domain_leadership: "Integration of Domain Leadership"
 TSH_vic_integration_of_domain_leadership_desc: "With our daimyo having more obligations to provide levies to our defence, it would be good to incorperate the leadership of each of our vassals into a central command. This will keep daimyo close at hand, and also maintain the loyalty of their soldiers."
 TSH_vic_greater_daimyo_contribution: "Greater Daimyo Contribution"
 TSH_vic_greater_daimyo_contribution_desc: "With the arrival of the West at our shores, we cannot slack on our defence any longer. We shall further demand more levies from our daimyo in the defence of the nation."
 TSH_vic_shogunates_sword: "Shogunate's Sword"
 TSH_vic_shogunates_sword_desc: "The daimyo shall become the sword of the Shogun on the field of battle. His will shall crush all who stand in the way of the nation!"
 TSH_vic_fireams_dealings: "Firearms Dealings"
 TSH_vic_fireams_dealings_desc: "Firearm making has been a staple in Japan since we got hold of our first firearm from the Portuguese, however, the firearms of today are much different than the ones of centuries ago. We are not yet able to manufacture them ourselves, and as such, must arm ourselves with the manufacture of foreigners. In that effort, we must make contacts to buy from."
 TSH_vic_field_gun_dealings: "Field Gun Dealings"
 TSH_vic_field_gun_dealings_desc: "Making muskets and rifles is one thing, but field guns are another. The field guns of today fire at greater rates, with greater charges and greater accuracy, but are complicated and expensive to make. Therefore, we must once again look to the rest of the world for properly made guns, until we ourselves can produce them."
 TSH_vic_formation_of_command: "Formation of Command"
 TSH_vic_formation_of_command_desc: "A proper command structure is the backbone of any modern fighting force of our time. Creating it in the image of the West, we shall be at least able to match them."

 TSH_vic_studey_western_field_tactics_desc: "While we do not have an army from the West to observe performing field maneuvers, we do have the manuals they are based on. We will take our time to immaculately study all aspects of their practice."
 TSH_vic_study_field_command: "Study Field Command"
 TSH_vic_study_field_command_desc: "Performing tactics in the field while in battle is an integral part of success, but we must also master the matter of communicating and coordinating such maneuvers correctly if that is to succeed at all."
 TSH_vic_invite_foreign_military_mission: "Invite Foreign Military Mission"
 TSH_vic_invite_foreign_military_mission_desc: "Studying theory has lead us to this point, but to advance further we have to practice it with experts of the field on site. We will send a request to France for a military mission to travel to Japan to assist our further military modernization and development."
 TSH_vic_reviewing_the_bakufu_navy: "Reviewing the Bakufu Navy"
 TSH_vic_reviewing_the_bakufu_navy_desc: "Japan, as an island nation, is heavily dependent on its navy to be able to defend itself from intruders coming from the seas. However, as with much of our fighting force, 200 years of peace has left our capabilities to defend our seas sorely lacking. The incursion of Commodore Perry is a clear testament to this, and serious investment into naval development must be made."
 TSH_vic_kaigunsho: "Kaigunsho"
 TSH_vic_kaigunsho_desc: ""Kaigunsho", or naval centers, have recently been opened up as a learning area for all things relating to the navy. Naval engineering, navigation, sailing and fighting are all discussed here, and is critical for teaching our officers and ship crews."
 TSH_vic_consort_with_foreign_navies: "Consort with Foreign Navies"
 TSH_vic_consort_with_foreign_navies_desc: "To redevelop our navy to the best that it can be, it would be prudent to catch up with modern naval convention from the navies around the world. We have done so in the past, and the present is no different. Let us do so."
 TSH_vic_seek_dutch_help: "Seek Dutch Help"
 TSH_vic_seek_dutch_help_desc: "The Dutch have long had relations with Japan through their trading base at Dejima, and is an important source of academic texts for our schoolars. Making use of our ties to them, perhaps we could ask for their assistance in naval matters?"
 TSH_vic_koninklijke_marine_assistance: "Koninklijke Marine Assistance"
 TSH_vic_koninklijke_marine_assistance_desc: "With the Dutch in agreement, and their Koninklijke Marine providing assistance in our training, we can significantly improve our capabilities in fighting at sea!"
 TSH_vic_centralize_national_fleet_command: "Centralize National Fleet Command"
 TSH_vic_centralize_national_fleet_command_desc: "The Navy, much like the Army, is an organization at its best when properly organized along a strong command. Centralizing our various commands into one that can communicate rapidly, is the best for our Navy."
 TSH_vic_seek_british_help: "Seek British Help"
 TSH_vic_seek_british_help_desc: "Our ties to the British have only just recently been developing, though we are at cordial relations. Despite what we think about them, however, we cannot deny the capability and vastness of the British Fleet. To learn from the navy that rules the waves... What better teacher is there?"
 TSH_vic_tsukji_naval_training_centre: "Tsukiji Naval Training Centre"
 TSH_vic_tsukji_naval_training_centre_desc: "With the help of the British, we are in a position to establish a naval academy that will train our future officers in the matters of naval war."
 TSH_vic_decentralize_fleet_command: "Decentralized Fleet Command"
 TSH_vic_decentralize_fleet_command_desc: "Spreading command out to local units to act in accordance to their current environment allows for more flexibility, though at the cost of some disorganization at a planning level."
 TSH_vic_naval_modernization: "Naval Modernization"
 TSH_vic_naval_modernization_desc: "While most of our vessels are of modern make and quality, they are few and with crews lacking experience. If we want a modern navy, then we must make moves towards rectifying these issues."
 TSH_vic_send_cadets_abroad: "Send Cadets Abroad"
 TSH_vic_send_cadets_abroad_desc: "Sending cadets and students abroad to foreign schools and navies will allow for future officers to learn from the best, while making useful contacts among foreign navies. Sending them away for some time to learn, then, is seemingly only beneficial."
 TSH_vic_expand_naval_facilities: "Expand Naval Facilities"
 TSH_vic_expand_naval_facilities_desc: "To accommodate growing our navy, we must expand our shipping facilities with new dockyards and area to build on."
 TSH_vic_foreign_steamship_dealing: "Foreign Steamship Dealing"
 TSH_vic_foreign_steamship_dealing_desc: "Most of our navy is of foreign construction, and for the forseeable future, will remain so until we gather enough experience and equipment to make our own. If we are to expand our navy, we'll have to purchase some ships abroad."
 TSH_vic_make_offers_for_ironclads: "Make Offers for Ironclads"
 TSH_vic_make_offers_for_ironclads_desc: "Recently, whispers of a new type of ship have come about. Ships that are made of hulls of iron and steel, impervious to any gun of its time. For our own safety, we must get some of these "ironclad" warships!"
 TSH_vic_legacy_of_ragnaku: "Legacy of Rangaku"
 TSH_vic_legacy_of_ragnaku_desc: "The study of foreign literature had long been banned by the Bakufu over concerns that it would lead people astray. However, it is undeniable that Japan's modernization efforts would be much slower without the work of Rangaku schoolars efforts to translate and learn about the advances of science. Their legacy may grant us great fortune in the future, and so we shall continue to bear it."
 TSH_vic_foreign_expertise_i: "Foreign Expertise"
 TSH_vic_foreign_expertise_i_desc: "Inviting people with technical and industrial know-how, we can start to create a foundation that can support a homegrown industrial base."
 TSH_vic_means_of_manufacture: "Means of Manufacture"
 TSH_vic_means_of_manufacture_desc: "While knowing how to manufacture something is important, it is perhaps equally as important is having and using the tools to do so. Getting the tools and machines to build a desired product is of great import."
 TSH_vic_steam_machinery: "Steam Machinery"
 TSH_vic_steam_machinery_desc: "The engine of all industrial development that has occurred across the western world can be credibly attributed to the steam engine. Importing some of these to use and dismantle would be paramount to our industrial aspirations."

 TSH_vic_nagasaki_iron_foundry_desc: "The potential for an iron foundry at Nagasaki has recently become a reality worth investigating, and would be a useful facility to have."
 TSH_vic_nagasaki_arsenal: "Nagasaki Arsenal"
 TSH_vic_nagasaki_arsenal_desc: "With other supporting buildings close by, it would be possible to build an arsenal as well in Nagasaki. This would synergize well with other manufactories in the city."
 TSH_vic_nagasaki_naval_foundry: "Nagasaki Naval Foundry"
 TSH_vic_nagasaki_naval_foundry_desc: "Nagasaki is an important harbour for all manner of ships in the area. Improving infrastructure within the port district would allow for more naval facilities to be built."
 TSH_vic_mechanical_processing: "Mechanical Processing"
 TSH_vic_mechanical_processing_desc: "The steam engine is an important first step of any industry, but it is merely the power source of machines that do the actual work. Developing the tools that steam power, is the next step."
 TSH_vic_yokosuka_weapons_foundry: "Yokosuka Weapons Foundry"
 TSH_vic_yokosuka_weapons_foundry_desc: "Yokosuka is growing rapidly into a port of some importance. Developing a weapons foundry within the city has become a more viable option, as labour pools rise."

 TSH_vic_reverbatory_furnance_desc: "Construction and design of a modern reverbatory furnace has been in the works since 1853, and will be very important to our metal industries. Finishing up work on the furnace, and implementing it in full scale would be most prudent."
 TSH_vic_chemical_processing: "Chemical Processing"

 TSH_vic_yokosuka_shipyard_desc: "Being a port city with notable international traffic, and with ship maintenance of both foreign and national vessels becoming more important, it seems it is necessary to expand Yokosuka's shipyards to accommodate these increased demands."
 TSH_vic_yokohama_ironworks: "Yokohama Ironworks"
 TSH_vic_yokohama_ironworks_desc: "With iron and steel manufactury kicking off, we'll need a dedicated industry to both shape and construct the materials into something useful as well. An ironworks in Yokohama would do well in this effort."
 TSH_vic_theory_of_manufacture: "Theory of Manufacture"
 TSH_vic_theory_of_manufacture_desc: "Before one can begin to create something, one must first know how to properly and safely do so. In this effort, it is vital to study the methods and theory that goes into modern manufacturing before we start practicing it."
 TSH_vic_practical_observations: "Practical Observations"
 TSH_vic_practical_observations_desc: "Theory can only bring us so far. Being present in existing manufactories to study the workplace in action would bring far more useful information immediately, than by reading and discussing manufacture."
 TSH_vic_labour_techniques: "Labour Techniques"

 TSH_vic_send_students_abroad: "Send Students Abroad"
 TSH_vic_send_students_abroad_desc: "The West has shown that its mastery of technology and power has long since surpassed the ones of the old powers in East Asia. To learn and master what the hegemons of the world have, we must go to them directly. Promising minds, if willing, will be sent to western universities and other learning institutions to learn of new innovations, and then return."
 TSH_vic_yokosuka_technical_school: "Yokosuka Technical School"

 TSH_vic_the_illness_of_shogun_iesada_desc: "The Shogun has fallen ill! With the recent arrival of westerners on our shores, it would seem that they have brought with them foreign ills as well. With the Shogun's frail health, it is expected that he will not have much longer to live..."
 TSH_vic_loyal_to_emperor: "Loyal to the Emperor"

 TSH_vic_hitotsubashi_shogun: "Hitotsubashi Shogun"
 TSH_vic_hitotsubashi_shogun_desc: "Keiki Hitotsubashi is a promising candidate for the title of Shogun. An educated and patient man, though a bit indecisive, Keiki has the support of Tokugawa Nariaki and various able lords that favour his rule. While these lords are powerful and with influence, they are in the minority against their rivaling candidate in Iemochi..."
 TSH_vic_conciliate_the_court: "Conciliate the Court"
 TSH_vic_conciliate_the_court_desc: "With the succession of Yoshinobu as Shogun, we must quickly look to the affairs of state. The Bakufu had defied the Imperial Court in acting without their proper consent when Commodore Perry and Townsend Harris came knocking, and the defiance of Imperial will has strained the relations between the Court and the Bakufu. To mainain our legitimacy for the future, it's important to placate the Court."
 TSH_vic_relax_sankin_kotai_attendance: "Relax Sankin-Kotai Attendance"
 TSH_vic_relax_sankin_kotai_attendance_desc: "The Sankin-Kotai practice has long functioned well as an instrument of stability within the Shogunate, but recent developments have made it a topic of contention within our rebellious lords. For their placation and trust, we will make moves to relax these obligations for all our lords, and trust in their motives."
 TSH_vic_restrict_fudai_favouritism: "Restrict Fudai Favouritism"
 TSH_vic_restrict_fudai_favouritism_desc: "The root of our current instability can reasonably be said to be found in the Tozama-Fudai split in our daimyo. While we gave the Fudai privileges for being allies at Sekigahara in 1600, we simultaneously punished and alienated the Tozama, our enemy at the battle. To mend this split, we shall equalize our inter-lord relationships. No favouritism shall be given to anyone."
 TSH_vic_level_the_field: "Level the Field"
 TSH_vic_level_the_field_desc: "Continuing with our equalization of the daimyo, we must also allow for equal participation of Tozama and Fudai lords in administration and governance. This has been primarily held by the Fudai as well, and must be equalized despite the complaints of some already in power."
 TSH_vic_kii_shogun: "Kii Shogun"
 TSH_vic_kii_shogun_desc: "The candidate from the cadet house of Kii, Iemochi, is of similarly frail health as Iesada as well as very young and inexperienced. While these qualities make him a poor choice as Shogun, he has significant influence backing him. The Bakufu administration, the main house of Tokugawa as well as the Tairo, Ii Naosuke all support his candidacy.

 ####FOCUS EVENTS####
 shogunate_japan.0.t: "The Tokugawa Shogunate"
 shogunate_japan.0.d: "Ever since Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Japan entered into an era of unprecedented unity, stability, and progress under his new Shogunate. This era, dubbed the Edo Period after the bakufu capital, would see the beginnings of Japan's complete withdrawal from the outside world, save for brief contacts with China and Korea under the policy of sakoku, or closed country, enacted between 1633-1639. With its strong isolationist stance, Japan was able to resist the spread of Christianity and other Western influences within the country, maintaining its independence, at the cost of sealing off contact with modern innovations, save for a small Dutch trading post in the bay of Nagasaki called Dejima. Although contacts with the Dutch were limited, Japanese scholars were able to obtain a fair amount of knowledge on modern medicine and technology through the Rangaku studies, but the country as a whole still lagged far behind the West. \n \nThis 220-year paradigm, and the peace that came with it, suddenly came to a screeching halt when American Commodore Matthew C. Perry steamed into Edo Bay on July 8, 1853 and demanded that Japan end its long period of isolation and adopt formal trade relations with the US. To back up his demands were the might of his powerful steamships, which the Japanese called the black ships because of the color of the warships and the smoke that belched out of their coal-fired steam engines. The Shogunate, virtually threatened at gunpoint to end sakoku, finally agreed to sign the Convention of Kanagawa with Perry on March 31, 1854. The terms of the Convention agreed to the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American vessels, ensured the safety of American castaways, and established an American consul in Japan. \n \nThe aftermath of the Convention would cast a huge shadow of doubt over the Shogun's historical responsibility to oppose Western encroachment into Japan, and it was the catalyst for the rise of the Sonno Joi movement, or the belief that the Shogun was no longer capable of resisting the West, and that the Emperor should be entrusted with such an important role. With the security of Japan deeply threatened, the Shogunate overturned many of its policies restricting its naval capabilities in 1855, and desperately sought to improve the strength of its defenses as quickly as possible. However, centuries of peace have atrophied the fighting capability of Japanese troops, and with growing discontent from the historically hostile tozama daimyo, the Shogunate is quickly approaching its day of reckoning..."
 shogunate_japan.0.a: "For whom does the wind blow?"
 shogunate_japan.1.t: "The Harris Treaty"
 shogunate_japan.1.d: "An envoy from [USA.GetNameDef] by the name of Townsend Harris has once again approached the Bakufu, seeking the ratification of a new, so-called Treaty of Amity and Commerce. Its contents include an exchange of diplomatic agents between the US and Japan, the additional opening of the ports of Kanagawa and Nagasaki to the existing ports of Shimoda and Hakodate agreed to be opened originally in the Convention of Kanagawa, to be effective July 4th 1859, extraterritoriality rights for their citizens, new fixed low import-export duties subject to international control, and the right of freedom of religious expression to US nationals in Japan.\n\nThese demands are much higher than the treaty signed with Commodore Perry in the past, and the sudden introduction of foreigners into the shogunal capital of Edo is bound to cause a great deal of socioeconomic instability. However, we are sadly in no real position to oppose these demands, and if we were to refuse this treaty we may end up the same way China did in their Opium War. Our only choice now is, should we bring this before the Emperor and convince him to ratify the treaty, or is the signature of a bakufu official enough?"
 shogunate_japan.1.a: "We must convince the Emperor!"
 shogunate_japan.1.b: "The Shogun rules, not the Emperor!"
 shogunate_japan.2.t: "The Emperor's Decision"
 shogunate_japan.2.d: "Despite our special envoy Lord Hotta Masayoshi's best efforts to convince Emperor Komei in his Kyoto court to accept the terms of the American unequal treaty, the Emperor firmly believes that no such deals should be made with barbarians as their presence on our isles would violate its sanctity. As our Emperor's understanding of these foreigners stems merely from ukiyo-e prints of Westerners depicted as deplorable demons, it is unlikely that the bakufu has any capability of convincing him to open our ports to their traders.\n\nAlthough the Shogun himself could still ratify the treaty, acceding to the Westerners' demands without Imperial support would certainly sow popular disapproval of the Bakufu."
 shogunate_japan.2.a: "We have no choice..."
 shogunate_japan.15.t: "Purchase of Foreign Books"
 shogunate_japan.15.d: "Although we have in the past sought to reject the infringing influences of the West, there is no denying that their ways of war, commerce and technology is superior to ours. Holding to the old ways is no longer enough to protect Japan's sacred soil, and we must make the effort learn the ways of the West if we desire remaining as masters of our own fate.\n\n"Rangaku"; foreigner studies, have long been present in our lands. Our previous approach have been detrimental to the nation's wellbeing. We shall continue Rangaku's legacy, and improve our understanding of the world; proudly shall Japan rise!"
 shogunate_japan.15.a: "We must advance our knowledge!"

 shogunate_japan.9.d: "With luggage packed, lunch eaten, shoes on and goodbyes given, our most gifted cadets from our naval academies are now setting out to various European and American port cities to learn more about these powers and their society. It is our hope that they will be able to learn much from their stay there, as well as to make contacts within foreign nations to be used later. Their year-long departure will keep our academies' benches empty, but, undoubtedly, with their return the academies will become even more rich with the wealth of knowledge that returns with our cadets!"
 shogunate_japan.9.a: "Bon Voyage!"
 shogunate_japan.10.t: "Cadets' Return"
 shogunate_japan.10.d: "The cadets we sent out a year ago have now returned to Japanese soil. Experienced and worldly, they bring with them a wealth of news, oddities, discoveries and items from the Western world. With their safe return, we can now make good use of their talents to improve and expand our own knowledge!"
 shogunate_japan.10.a: "Subarashi!"
 shogunate_japan.17.t: "The Question of the Kabunakama"
 shogunate_japan.17.d: "For an exceedingly long time in the Shogunate's history there have been agreements between the ruling Bakufu and various small, but important, merchant guilds. These are the Kabunakama, which form various merchant groups within differing market groups and trades within the country, primarily in the large cities. While initially the Shoguns were hesitant to cooperate with their demands, they were eventually given grants and various rights to monopolize certain parts of the Japanese economy. This created strong guilds that could cooperate with furthering the economy, but also a strong interest group who would resist any attempts at relinquishing their given grants.\n\nRōjū Mizuno Tadakuni attempted a decade prior to restrain the Kabunakama's monopoly practices, though ended in failure due to extensive push-back from the guilds. As it stands today, the merchant guilds remain in a strong position. While we benefit from their economic practices, some argue that the Kabunakama are smothering new buinesses with monopolies and restricting competition between businesses to provide better solutions. Tadakuni failed to remove their privileges before, but they are a useful boon to us. What to do with these merchant guilds?"
 shogunate_japan.17.a: "Their grip must loosen"
 shogunate_japan.17.b: "There is no need for change"
 shogunate_japan.17.c: "I wonder what they can do with more power?"

 shogunate_japan.18.d: "In our effort to learn and modernize to the standard of the West, it is of exceeding importance to get their knowledge and advances into our nation. In that effort, we cannot only rely on books. We must gain experience directly as well! Promising students are now preparing to travel abroad to get a taste of Western ways of doing things, as well as to learn more about what makes the West so strong as it has become."
 shogunate_japan.18.a: "The path to knowledge is long..."
 shogunate_japan.19.t: "Return of the Students"
 shogunate_japan.19.d: "The students we sent to the West have returned. Dressed in clothes in Western style on arrival, and having gotten a taste of the West's way of life, they have much experience gotten from their travels it would seem. We will put their gained experiences to good use for the nation!"

 ####TOKUGAWA SUCCESSION STRUGGLE####
 shogunate_japan.16.t: "Cholera Outbreak in Edo!"
 shogunate_japan.16.d: "A stench of death wafts coldly throughout the streets of Edo today...\n\nMany people considered the arrival of the Black Ships and their crews of bearded barbarians on our shores to be a sign of a bad omen, and recently many more have become more convinced of its fact. That the Shogun's allowance of the West to enter Japan, and the subsequent disasterous events in earthquakes and famines, were the anger of the Gods that the Shogun had so carelessly betrayed. Another omen has struck. In the many houses of the metropolis that is Edo, mothers, sons, daughters and fathers lie, dead or alive in their beds afflicted by another passenger of these Black Ships. The seat of shogunal power now houses another plague of the West: Cholera."
 shogunate_japan.16.a: "The Gods scorn us!"
 shogunate_japan_l.0.t: "The Heirless Shogun"
 shogunate_japan_l.0.d: "Shogun Iesada has no direct heir to the Shogunal throne; a source of great concern among Bakufu officials. Normally, when the Shogun is still this young, it would not be a source of immediate concern. However, the Shogun suffers from exceptionally poor health. Having suffered from pox in his childhood, and survived, it has left him severely weakened and slightly scarred.\n\nWith much uncertainty in current times originating with the arrival of the "Southern Barbarians", and the rise of anti-Bakufu and anti-western movements in the country-side, the lack of an heir poses a great issue. If Iesada is unable to produce a son, which seems increasingly the case, then a candidate must be chosen from one of his cadet houses. Factionalism and in-fighting has already begun within the Shogunate over who may take Iesada's place should he pass away... The Shogunate's very existence may very much be in danger over this question."
 shogunate_japan_l.0.a: "200 years of peace; fading..."
 shogunate_japan_l.6.t: "Ii Naosuke becomes Tairō"
 shogunate_japan_l.6.d: "In the middle of the political in-fighting of the Shogunate, it would seem that the supporters of the candidate from the house of Kii has gotten the better of the clashing. Today the clever and able Ii Naosuke was elected to the position of Tairō, a position that has the power and prestige second only to the Shogun. His rise to the title has given the definitive edge to the Kii Party, and it's expected that with Ii Naosuke's position will push the title of Shogun to the young Yoshitomi..."
 shogunate_japan_l.6.a: "The Tairō takes the helm!"
 shogunate_japan_l.1.t: "Battle for the Shogunate"
 shogunate_japan_l.1.d: "With the Shogunate up for grabs for the most cunning and politically savy of people in the Tokugawa family, it's no wonder that both sides supporting each of their own heirs are trying their best to persuade Iesada and those who are close to him to select their candidate. Whichever candidate stands to gain favour, it is clear that they must both persuade the Shogun as much as put down the arguments of the opposing faction!\n\nOf the factions, there seem to be two parties forming primarily: the Party of Kii, supporting Yoshitomi Kii, and the Party of Hitotsubashi, supporting Keiki Hitotsubashi. Whoever takes the Shogunal throne will inevitably change the course of the Shogunate!"
 shogunate_japan_l.1.a: "The struggle begins..."
 shogunate_japan_l.2.t: "The Tozama and Lord of Mito send emissaries to Kyoto"
 shogunate_japan_l.2.d: "It would seem that the first move in the game for the Shogunate has been made by the camp that supports Keiki Hitotsubashi as Shogun...\n\nEmissaries from the Lords of Echizen, Satsuma, Tosa and Uwajima, all powerful and influential, have arrived today in Kyoto, no doubt to see the Emperor and his court. The emissaries all come from different lords, from both the house of Tokugawa as well as the houses of the Tozama. All of them, however, in unison sing the praise of the abilities and legitimacy of the candidate from the Tokugawa cadet house of Kii, Keiki Hitotsubashi. Clearly arguing that the ascendance of rival candidate Iemochi, being much younger and inexperienced, would lead to ruin for the Shogunate.\n\nThe Court seems to have been swayed by their words, perhaps agreeing in their analysis of young Iemochi, or on the ties of blood which the Court and the Lords share. Whatever may be the case, it is clear that Keiki's position has become stronger in the Court and therefore generally..."
 shogunate_japan_l.2.a: "Keiki strikes first!"
 shogunate_japan_l.3.t: "Hotta Masayoshi supports Keiki Hitotsubashi"
 shogunate_japan_l.3.d: "Rōjū Hotta Masayoshi, one of the most important elders of the Bakufu administration has also traveled to Kyoto to add his weight behind Keiki Hitotsubashi's candidacy before the Imperial Court. Underlining the importance of competent rulership to guide the Shogunate to a prosperous future, his support for the experienced Keiki is reasoned by this argumentation. Before a figure as important as Hotta, the Court is inclined to agree. His seeking of approval of the Court has also been received with positivity among courtiers, as it is hoped that the Court and Bakufu can cooperate more efficiently.\n\nHotta Masayoshi's efforts has rewarded him with the support of the Imperial Court, as well as an Imperial decree supporting the policy of the Shogunate. Keiki's cause grows..."
 shogunate_japan_l.3.a: "The elder takes his stance!"
 shogunate_japan_l.4.t: "Fudai Lords push back!"
 shogunate_japan_l.4.d: "The Fudai, having long enjoyed the favour of the Tokugawa Shogunate, have reacted strongly to the advance of Keiki's campaign. Considering their opponents, it is perhaps unsurprising. The Tozama support Keiki's leadership as a levelheaded ruler to further their own interests within the Shogunate as well, which would imply in no uncertain terms that their privileges would be imposed on.\n\nThe Fudai are now making their influence within the Bakufu felt, as they push for the advancement of their candidate in Yoshitomi. The Fudai, being closely related to the Tokugawa, have signficantly more weight and ties within the Shogunate than the alienated and shunned Tozama. Keiki has advanced quite some distance, but will he be defeated by the heavily entrenched will of the Fudai?"
 shogunate_japan_l.4.a: "Order does not go unchallenged!"
 shogunate_japan_l.4.b: "Stop them!"
 shogunate_japan_l.5.t: "Revocation of the Imperial Decree"
 shogunate_japan_l.5.d: "Recently, with the departure of Hotta Masayoshi from the Imperial Court in Kyoto, various rumors have spread that the Imperial decree he was sent with was not supported by the Emperor himself and was a creation of the Court without his own approval...\n\nWhile the Court is rebuffing this rumor, its weight has increased with the Fudai weighing in on the rumors credibility. Meeting increasing pressure and disproval from the Emperor, the Court has decided to cut their losses and recind the Imperial Decree, rendering it moot as a bargaining tool. Another blow to the Hitotsubashi Party and their candidate, but a major benefit for the Kii Party."
 shogunate_japan_l.5.a: "Divine Judgement!"
 shogunate_japan_l.5.b: "Is it necessary?"
 shogunate_japan_l.7.t: "Matsudaira Shungaku becomes Tairō"
 shogunate_japan_l.7.d: "In the middle of the political in-fighting of the Shogunate, it would seem that the supporters of the candidate from the house of Hitotsubashi has gotten the better of the clashing. Matsudaira Shungaku, with the help of the influence of the Court and supporting Lords, have been able to overturn the Fudai of the Bakufu and claim the title of Tairō for himself. Shungaku, being a supporter of Keiki's campaign, is expected to use his influence to push for the candidacy of Shogun for Keiki. This turn of events has lead to the Hitotsubashi Party to hold the advantage over the Kii Party, and Keiki's ambition to become Shogun has now become a strong certainty."
 shogunate_japan_l.7.a: "An important lynchpin..."
 shogunate_japan_l.8.t: "Death of Iesada Shogun"
 shogunate_japan_l.8.d: "What many have long expected or feared has now become a reality. The 13th Shogun of the Tokugawa Clan has passed on, losing what many saw as an inevitable battle against disease.\n\nThe procession and burial of the former Shogun's body was met with solemn but tense silence. Sorrow, emptiness, contempt, duty and plotting are all emotions and mindsets that fill the air during this moment. The Shogun's death has finally given justification in the question of who will take his place, and the supporters of each candidate knows of this fact very well; the Shogun died childless, and a new heir must be selected from the Tokugawa family to rule.\n\nIesada Shogun's death gave rise to two prominent factions that each supported a candidate that they would prefer to take the position of Shogun. Ii Naosuke, the Ōoku and the Bakufu are the main supporters of the youngest candidate, Tokugawa Yoshitomi in his bid to succeed Iesada. However, while there are many who support Yoshitomi's bid to the position, a second candidate has also come forth to contest Yoshitomi's claim. Tokugawa Yoshinobu, son of Tokugawa Nariaki of Mito, a political opponent of Ii Naosuke, has come forth to contest Yoshitomi's claim and to make his own bid as Shogun. Yoshinobu is older than Yoshitomi, and has more experience as a leading figure, but his father's connections and support of the notion of imperial rule makes him a dubious candidate in the eyes of the Bakufu.\n\nWhoever takes power of the two will define the era of the Shogunate!"
 shogunate_japan_l.8.a: "Who will become Shogun?"
 shogunate_japan_l.9.t: "A New Shogun!"
 shogunate_japan_l.9.d: "Today marks the beginning of a new rule in Japan; a new Shogun has been chosen!\n\nThe political battle has concluded, and out of the dust of manouvering, lobbying and appeals there stands only one candidate..."

 ####MISC EVENTS####
  shogunate_japan_fl.0.a: "Kashima!"
 shogunate_japan_fl.1.t: "Attack on Russian sailors!"
 shogunate_japan_fl.1.d: "Yokohama was, prior to the entry of Commodore Perry's black ships, merely a small fishing village south of the Shogunal capital in Edo. However, the small village has shown a trend to grow rapidly in the wake of recent treaties with the Western powers, making the city a port open for powers that have signed treaties with us in the recent past.\n\nWhile most in the Bakufu believe that the opening of ports to appease Western interests, over outright rejecting them, was the lesser of two evils, many of our subjects are staunchly opposed to their incursion on national soil. This has now culminated into open-day attacks on foreigners, and the small fishing town of Yokohama has now become the site of the murder of two Russian sailors by rouge Samurai discontent with the Shogun's latest policies. The sailors were found bloodily in pieces, violently struck down by the blade of one or more Samurai. In the area more bodies were found, being of Chinese traders and native Japanese attendées serving Westerners.\n\nThe incident has spurred both the anger of the Russian embassy and the cheers of treaty opponents. The Russian minister demands that the perpetrators be caught and handed over for judgement, and for the local garrison to prevent such attacks occurring in the future."
 shogunate_japan_fl.1.a: "What!?"
 shogunate_japan_fl.2.t: "Attack on Dutch captains!"
 shogunate_japan_fl.2.d: "Another attack on foreigners in Yokohama has occurred!\n\nToday, two Dutch captains were found dead on the streets of Yokohama after another assault by rouge Samurai. Tensions within the country has been high since the opening of the nation to the outside world and the barbarian Westerners, and the public upheval over the Shogunate's decision to fold in the face of the Western might has only stoked that tension further. Today marks another expression of that tension as the two captains were cut down around the Yokohama harbour, much like the previous murder on two Russian sailors. The Dutch were quick to lodge a complaint over the incident, but were quickly addressed with promises to capture the perpetrators.\n\nThe discontent over the state of the Shogunate is spreading further within Japan, and the people are fiercly debating the proper course of action which the nation should take in relation to these Westerners. Things are undecided and small now, but soon there may come a time when the fate of the Shogunate must be decided."
 shogunate_japan_fl.2.a: "Another one!?"
 shogunate_japan_fl.3.t: "Attack on a French minister servant!"
 shogunate_japan_fl.3.d: "A new attack on a foreigner has occurred!\n\nThis time a servant of the French minister in Japan was attacked, but not killed. The servant was wounded by discontent Samurai, but before they could finish the job, the other servants as well as the local garrison and minister retinue interfered. The rouge attacker fled the scene when the pressure mounted, but was later captured.\n\nThe incident marks the third attack within a year, and murmurs among the Western dignitaries speak of moving more guards into Yokohama to protect their officials. It would seem that their patience is running thin. Things are calm for now, but if another incident like this should occur, then it is likely that a simple apology will not suffice..."

 tsh_news.0.d: "A new Shogun now sits on the throne in the old shogunal seat of power in Edo!\n\nThe new Shogun, Iemochi, takes the seat of power at a young, young age of 12 years old. As it is not expected that someone of such a young age can rule a nation without great ability or great difficulty, the young Shogun will be supervised by great elder and acting regent Ii Naosuke and others. They will manage and rule in the stead of the Shogun until the young boy has learned more and come of age, in time for when he must fulfill his duty as Shogun.\n\nHis selection as Shogun has been met with mixed reactions from the Japanese people. While there are some who rejoice over the arrival of a new leader to guide them in these uncertain times for Japan, there are many dissenting voices that still speak of the weakness of the former Shogun and the Shogunate's inability to protect Japan from foreign invaders. It remains to be seen how Shogun Iemochi's rule will shape Japan and her future in the coming years, but now the winds of change will blow Japan across the ocean of time, and into the star-filled horizon of promise that is the future."

 tsh_news.1.d: "A new Shogun now sits on the throne in the old shogunal seat of power in Edo!\n\nThe new Shogun, Yoshinobu, takes the seat of power. A young man with promising prospects in the role of Shogun, his ascendance is viewed as a boon for the future rule of the Shogunate. Able and experienced in the matters of state and governance, there are great expectations in what the Shogun can do, but also in the tasks that he has to see to as well.\n\nHis selection as Shogun has been met with positive reactions from the Japanese people. While there are some who rejoice over the arrival of a new leader to guide them in these uncertain times for Japan, there are many dissenting voices that still speak of the weakness of the former Shogun and the Shogunate's inability to protect Japan from foreign invaders.

 Tokugawa_Shogun_Emperor_Influence_Category_desc: "§gJapan is nearing a political crisis. For the first time in centuries, the authority of the Shogunate is eroding. Widely seen as weak and inept, the current Shogun is aging and without heir. Meanwhile, the Imperial Throne, which for generations has held an unintrusive stance on administration, is returning to the political stage. As the Shogunate continues to industrialize and bend the knee to Western powers, Daimyo and Samarai across the nation are beginning to question if it is time to return absolute power to the Emperor.\n \nThe two factions, Pro-Imperial and Pro-Shogunate are now battling for the heart of the public. With civil conflict on the horizons, feudal lords must decide who should lead Japan."

 TSH_Category_Bakumatsu_Modernization_desc: "For more than two centuries, Japan had sheltered itself successfully from the tumult of the outside world under the guise of its isolation policies. However, ever since the arrival of Commodore Perry and the signing of his Kanagawa Treaty in 1854, Japan in its current state stands in a position of great weakness, unable to resist the demands of the Western technological giants who have already smited the great power that was once China.\n\nAlthough many of our people fear the West and deplore the idea of Westerners coming to our shores, it has come to the attention of some of our top advisors that if Japan is to survive the onslaught of the Western barbarians, it is urgent that we invest as many resources as possible into sponsoring foreign studies, both domestically and abroad, to ensure our national defense and the independence of our great realm."
