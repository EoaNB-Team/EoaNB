 scan_monetary_union.1.t: "Possibility of a Scandinavian Monetary Union"
 scan_monetary_union.1.d: "[ROOT.GetName] is a small country in European, let alone global terms. In order for our economy to survive, it might be imperative to find collaboration partners in this age of imperialism and economic block-building to secure our sovereignty. Our Nordic brethren face similar challenges and some of our businessmen have already reached out to other Scandinavian industrialists and brought up the idea of a Scandinavian monetary union. It would probably be wise to participate in the discussions lying ahead. What should we do?"
 scan_monetary_union.1.a: "Go ahead."
 SDN_smu_discussions_present_effect_tt: "§GThis will give you a much better chance of successful discussions.§!"
 scan_monetary_union.1.b: "Leave it be."
 SDN_smu_discussions_not_present_effect_tt: "§RAlthough you might still be able to join a potential monetary union later, this will significantly lower the possibility of success.§!"
 scan_monetary_union.2.t: "Scandinavian Monetary Union?\nPreliminary Meeting at Gothenburg"
 scan_monetary_union.2.d: "Industrialists, businessmen, scholars, and politicians from all over Scandinavia have gathered in Gothenburg to discuss the possibility of a Scandinavian Monetary Union in the future. The most intensely debated issue is the currency question and how it should be organized and based. Although the immediate political impact of the meeting is expected to be minor, the first foundation for further talks has been laid."
 scan_monetary_union.2.a: "A good start."
 scan_monetary_union.2.b: "Let them have their hypothetical discussions."
 scan_monetary_union.2.c: "Perhaps we should join the next meeting?"
 scan_monetary_union.2.e: "We made the wrong decision, let's drop out."
 SDN_smu_discussions_rejoin_effect_tt: "§GAlthough we are certainly going to be frowned upon for some time for turning down the initial invitation, this will soon blow over and, going forward, we will join the next meeting to participate in these discussions.§!"
 scan_monetary_union.3.t: "Scandinavian Monetary Union?\nPreliminary Meeting at Stockholm"
 scan_monetary_union.3.d: "Once again, industrialists, businessmen, scholars, and politicians from all over Scandinavia have gathered, this time in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, to further discuss the possibility of a Scandinavian Monetary Union. The most intensely debated issue is the basis of a future Scandinavian currency and the corresponding unit of account. Whereas most Scandinavian currencies have traditionally followed a silver standard, a slim majority seems to be in favor of following a gold standard with the French gold franc as the preferred unit of account. It was argued, that this would have several advantages: since gold currencies already account for more than half of the Scandinavian foreign trade, the costly and inefficient process of exchanging them into silver to mint silver coins could be avoided. Additionally, gold is worth much more than the same amount of silver, which would make fewer coins necessary and transportation of larger sums of money easier, plus gold is also more resistant than silver. These characteristics also make it harder to counterfeit gold coins. However, the recent geopolitical events in Germany will probably mean that a binding decision will not be reached any time soon."
 scan_monetary_union.3.a: "Things are starting to get serious."
 scan_monetary_union.3.b: "Let them continue to have their hypothetical discussions."
 scan_monetary_union.3.c: "Perhaps we'd really like to join the next meeting?"
