###Focuses###
 ICE_weather_problem: "The Migration Problem"
 ICE_weather_problem_desc: "A harsh climate, poor soil, and recently, a great eruption at Askja, has led to a great number of people leaving Iceland in search of a more hospitable land in the Americas. While understandable, this is a great issue with our already small population becoming smaller as a result. This must be handled with haste!"
 ICE_new_iceland: ""New Iceland""
 ICE_new_iceland_desc: "The migrants leaving Iceland have largely decided to settle a new area in Western Canada they dub "New Iceland". Localized close to Lake Winnipeg, they have made a new settlement they call Gimli. While it is positive that they have reached their new land safely, it is questionable what the fate of this colony will be."
 ICE_dont_worry_better_weather_soon: "It will pass soon enough"
 ICE_dont_worry_better_weather_soon_desc: "Iceland and its people has weathered many, many environmental hazards and disasters before, and this is no different. People are fleeing to new lands to escape the land's turbulent nature, but they are much too short-sighted in their choice. Nature will temper and calm itself soon enough..."
 ICE_give_out_warmer_clothes: "Help the afflicted"
 ICE_give_out_warmer_clothes_desc: "The environment is unforgiving in Iceland, this our people have known since Ingólfr Arnarson himself stepped foot on its soil. This does not mean that we cannot or should not soothe the struggles of the common people on this basis. We must purchase and distribute quilts, blankets and clothes suited better to the current situation."
 ICE_fix_this_now: "Address the issue"
 ICE_fix_this_now_desc: "We have clearly not been diligent enough in our duty to help our people if they are fleeing their own homes! The situation is difficult for many, and we must make efforts to support and encourage those who need it most."
 ICE_limmit_emigration: "Limit emigration"
 ICE_limmit_emigration_desc: "The amount of emigration the nation is experiencing at the moment is too much to bear. We cannot in good faith stop the people from trying to find a better life... However, we can always fix the books a bit and slow down the bureaucratic process to limit the amount of people leaving by such means until we get a better handle on the situation..."
 ICE_patrol_boats: "Patrol boats on the West Coast"
 ICE_patrol_boats_desc: "By deploying patrol boats along regular migration routes and using clever misdirection, we can make boats with migrants return to Iceland by convincing them that the seas beyond are in unrest and dangerous sail in."
 ICE_border_control: "Border control"
 ICE_border_control_desc: "As Iceland is an isolated island in the middle of the North Atlantic, this makes controlling our borders a simple task. Only ships with our permission may dock at our harbors, and only those with permission may leave."
 ICE_slowly_recover: "A slow recovery"
 ICE_slowly_recover_desc: "We have made various efforts to manage the migration amount, and it seems that the situation is now finally starting to calm down. Now we can finalize our recovery from our latest problems, and return to our former state."
 ICE_encourage_population_growth: "Recuperation"
 ICE_encourage_population_growth_desc: "Iceland is safe again. Families can now resume their lives and live in relative tranquility.\n\n...At least until the next natural disaster comes around."
 
 ICE_our_military_buget: "Our military budget"
 ICE_our_military_buget_desc: "Iceland has not seen much fighting since the times of the Icelandic Commonwealth, but that does not preclude us from the realm of conflict. There may come a time when Iceland's sovereignty is challenged by a foreign foe. We must be ready for such a possibility."
 ICE_copy_danish_designs: "Copy Danish designs"
 ICE_copy_danish_designs_desc: "The Danes and us have a mixed relationship. That, however, does not mean we can't learn a thing or two from them. We will copy some designs of theirs; surely they won't mind."
 ICE_copy_british_ironclads: "Copy British ironclads"
 ICE_copy_british_ironclads_desc: "The British are the undisputed masters of the sea. Their designs reflect that supremacy, and thus, is highly useful to copy!"
 ICE_train_on_the_watters: "Exercises at sea"
 ICE_train_on_the_watters_desc: "Regardless of design, ships fight only as well as their crew are trained. And so, we must train with due diligence if we are to be any good in a fight at sea."
 ICE_recruit_sailors: "Recruit sailors"
 ICE_recruit_sailors_desc: "Iceland has a long maritime tradition; there is no shortage of skilled seamen to draft into our navy."
 ICE_come_back: "Call for the New Icelanders"
 ICE_come_back_desc: "Not all who fled to the Americas found their new life particularly improved or better than the ones they had at home. Let us reinvite these potential returnees."
 ICE_buy_guns_from_usa: "Procure arms from the Americans"
 ICE_buy_guns_from_usa_desc: "The Americans are proud of their right to bear arms and have no shortage of small arms to bring to bear; or to sell, for that matter. Let us approach them as our suppliers for weapons."
 ICE_buy_uniforms_from_denmark: "Buy uniforms from Denmark"
 ICE_buy_uniforms_from_denmark_desc: "With our connections to the Danish realm, we could certainly find a tailor or two to manufacture the uniforms we need for our forces."
 ICE_accept_volunteers: "Accept volunteers"

 ICE_army_drills_in_harsh_terrain: "Fighting in difficult terrain"
 ICE_army_drills_in_harsh_terrain_desc: "Iceland consists of many steep fjords, sprawling hills and trecherous mountains. To fight in such unforgiving terrain requires skill, knowledge and training. We must be diligent."
 ICE_regular_training_drills: "Regular drill exercises"

 ICE_hard_trained_army: "A well-trained army"
 ICE_hard_trained_army_desc: "Our army is shaping up to become a competent fighting force which may face any foe on equal terms.\n\n...At least in terms of general competence."
 ICE_advance_to_victorian_army: "Advance to Victorian army standards"
 ICE_advance_to_victorian_army_desc: "The Victorian Age has seen many new improvements and inventions in the realm of warfare. We can now claim to have mastered these new conditions of war."
 ICE_study_other_countries_weapons: "Study foreign weapons"

 ICE_icelandic_army_doctrine: "Doctrine of the Herfylkingin"
 ICE_icelandic_army_doctrine_desc: "An army cannot fight with excellence if the army fighting does not know what its objective is. By defining the role of our army, as well as the means, tactics and strategy to achieving that role, we will know exactly how we must fight."
 ICE_take_civilian_weppons_to_nationalstockpile: "Requisition private arms"
 ICE_take_civilian_weppons_to_nationalstockpile_desc: "We do not necessarily have all the weapons we need to supply the army... An alternative could be to requisition private weapons in possession of our citizens. This will not be popular, though why would civilians need arms?"
 ICE_navy_drills: "Drill our fleet"
 ICE_navy_drills_desc: "Just like any force, it can only fight as well as its training. We will train our fleet to equal the best."
 ICE_navy_hulls: "Ship hulls"

 ICE_our_constitution: "Our constitution"

 ICE_remain_as_puppet: "Remain a Danish Territory"
 ICE_remain_as_puppet_desc: "Iceland cannot stand on its own legs. Be it our small population, our small economy or our dependence on foreign imports to survive, it is clear that Iceland cannot survive by its own power. While we find the Danes disagreeable at times, we cannot survive without their help. Independence is a reckless dream peddled by uncouth revolutionaries."
 ICE_icelandic_conservative_party: "Icelandic Conservative Party"
 ICE_icelandic_conservative_party_desc: "To maintain order on the island, we should strengthen the pro-Danish parties in Iceland."
 ICE_get_old_convoys_from_den: "Request old convoys from Denmark"
 ICE_get_old_convoys_from_den_desc: "To pull Iceland closer to Denmark, requests should be made to increase the local stock of convoy ships to ease the logistical burden of administering the distant island."
 ICE_more_trade: "Focus more on trade"
 ICE_more_trade_desc: "Iceland should be opened to foreign economic interests so that we may profit from international interests on the island."
 ICE_icelandic_equlity: "Icelandic equality"
 ICE_icelandic_equlity_desc: "If Iceland is to be tied closer to Denmark then we must concede on some points to the Icelanders. Iceland should have its local concerns represented equally to that of Danish concerns in the Danish parliament. This should appease those who call for greater autonomy."
 ICE_icelandic_traditions: "Icelandic traditions"
 ICE_icelandic_traditions_desc: "The Icelanders are a proud people. They value their traditions, language and way of life highly and are very suspicious of foreign incursions into that cultural sphere. As such, it may be the best move to simply let them do as they please and not force any cultural changes upon them."
 ICE_universal_suffrage: "Universal Suffrage"
 ICE_universal_suffrage_desc: "All who call themselves Icelander should have the right to influence and vote on the matters concerning their homeland. Let it be so."
 
 ICE_peacefull_independence: "The Sprout of the Fjölnismenn"
 ICE_peacefull_independence_desc: "The "Fjölnismenn" were a collection of Icelandic university students and poets who met and were educated in Bessastaðir and later in Copenhagen. Responsible for introducing the trend of National Romanticism into Icelandic consciousness, their journal Fjölnir has awoken a strong fire within Icelandic hearts about their shared origins and identity, and the idea of a renewed independent Icelandic nation. Copies of the journal travel from village to village, read aloud to large crowds, and invigorating lively discussions about the future of Iceland.\n\nIceland shall be free!"
 ICE_puch_for_home_rule: "Push for Home Rule"
 ICE_puch_for_home_rule_desc: "We are small and we are few. That, however, will not stop us from making our demands for more freedom. Those who rule us will hear our demands and give way."
 ICE_land_bjoo_og_tunga: "Land, þjóð og tunga"
 ICE_land_bjoo_og_tunga_desc: ""Land, þjóð og tunga" - Broadly meaning "Land, People and Language" is a term becoming more and more used in pro-independence circles as the rallying motto for the character of our nation.

The people, bound together as one."
 ICE_usa_support_us: "Lobby the Americans"
 ICE_usa_support_us_desc: "We are making ourselves heard in the matter of our independence, with discussions active across the land. However, it may be prudent to also seek the support of other powers in this matter. The Americans may find our plight sympathetic, considering their historical roots. Perhaps we could mobilize the Icelandic community in the US to lobby for our freedom?"
 ICE_get_support_from_the_althing: "Seek Alþingi support"
 ICE_get_support_from_the_althing_desc: "Regarded as perhaps the oldest surviving parliament in the world, the Alþingi is of exceeding importance to the new Icelandic state we are attempting to create. Securing its support is the most important domestic goal in our struggle for independence, and must be done with dispatch!"
 ICE_icelandic_peoples_rights: "Rights of the Icelandic people"
 ICE_icelandic_peoples_rights_desc: "The Icelanders are their own people. Settled by Norwegian adventurers seeking arable land across the sea, we have diverged quite a bit from our continental kinsmen which rule over us now.

 ICE_decrees_danish_influance: "Undercut Danish influence"
 ICE_decrees_danish_influance_desc: "We must curb the Danish hold over our island if we are ever to hope to stand on our own. We shall loosen the grip and reestablish ourselves."
 ICE_were_to_small_to_govern_ourselfs: "We will rule ourselves!"
 ICE_were_to_small_to_govern_ourselfs_desc: "The Danes tell us that we are too small and too few to rule our home. We will answer by showing just how mistaken this assumption is."

 ICE_invite_inventors_across_the_world_desc: "Foreign engineers have much to teach of the new developments occurring in the industrializing world, and so offer an important service to our own efforts to advance the scientific cause."

 ICE_scanidavian_monatry_union_focus_desc: "Joining the SMU would be good boon to Iceland's small but expanding economy. With the weight of the Scandinavian nations in addition to our own, we will have much greater possibilities for economic expansion."

 ICE_search_for_resources: "Search for resources"
 ICE_search_for_resources_desc: "It is unknown what riches our island holds in full. We should survey the land, searching every knick and corner to find what mineral and natural wealth the land holds for us."
 ICE_expand_southern_farms: "Expand southern farms"
 ICE_expand_southern_farms_desc: "Iceland is relatively barren, and not really suited for farming. Regardless, we should expand where we can, and the farms to the south seem ideal targets."

 ICE_not_to_small_desc: "The Danes have long limited our independence on the grounds that they believe us to be too small and too few to rule our own lands by our own law.
