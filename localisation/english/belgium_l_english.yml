 #belgium_event_naming.1.t: "Dutch, Walloon or English State Names?"
 #belgium_event_naming.1.d: "This mod gives you the option of choosing the language your state names and cities shall be in. Considering that Belgium is split between the Flemish population, which speak Dutch, and the Walloons, which speak Walloon, you have those two options. You can also choose to have both regions in their respective language, visualising the countries' split on the map. If you just want to play the game without those gimmicks (or if you are the ai ;) ), you can obviously keep the names in English. Choose wisely!"
 #belgium_event_naming.1.a: "Dutch is the way to go!"
 #belgium_event_naming.1.b: "Walloon is not so bad, right?"
 #belgium_event_naming.1.c: "I would like a bit of chaos."
 #belgium_event_naming.1.e: "Just let me play the game!"
 
 
 belgium_event.11.t: "Spreading of "fried potato sticks""
 belgium_event.11.d: "Since potatoes came to Europe from South America, its uses has always been seen as limited. Potato salad, mashed and boiled potatoes were the main way of consuming them, which, by itself, isn't a tasty meal. In the 18th century, Belgian cooks invented a new way of consuming it, by frying it in oil diced. This recipe might be old news, but now, new cooks found new ways of frying it. By cutting it in sticks, you can now consume it in a bag, and so it can be served in the streets. This has recently gained momentum around our biggest cities, and a lot of stall start to see its potential."
 belgium_event.11.a: "'Frites' would be a catchier name"

 belgium_event.15.t: "The Continental Proclamation"
 belgium_event.15.d: "The diplomatic state of Europe has gone sour in the last couple of years. The wars with Austria and Denmark showed the warmongering side of Prussia, and in response France is starting to become distant and is now preparing a potential assault, and with the reunification of the german lands, we, in the middle of all of this, should claim our place in this system. Today Léopold II, our king, has proclaimed the new path of belgian diplomacy following his strenghtening of his reign. "We are at the edge of a new european order, and we should be aware of it or pay the consequences" he said during his declaration, but we need to decide if this awareness will lead to diplomatic independence, as is required by the British backed Treaty of London, or if it will on the contrary, lead to our intervention in a potential Franco-Prussian war."
 belgium_event.15.a: "An ally for the righteous side"
 belgium_event.15.b: "Defend our place in this system"
