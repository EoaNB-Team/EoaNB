 ##Military##
 NOR_focus_norwegian_military: "The Norwegian Military"
 NOR_focus_norwegian_military_desc: ""

 NOR_focus_on_land: "The Army"
 NOR_focus_on_land_desc: "Although our nation is subordinate to Sweden in many ways, we still maintain our own army. As the future unfolds before us a decision must be made with the future of our army, as both its political future and the technologies being developed ensure that its current state cannot be maintained."

 NOR_focus_vernepliktsdebatten: "Vernepliktsdebatten"
 NOR_focus_vernepliktsdebatten_desc: "Following the first adoption of Levee En Masse, conscription has only grown in popularity, as more nations throughout the world adopt it. In Norway the question has appeared as well, as the value of such a system in a nation with a highly limited population rates. Are professional soldiers no longer sufficient, and can our nation support an army of the size that conscription would create?"
 NOR_focus_swedish_army: "An Army to the Swedes"
 NOR_focus_swedish_army_desc: "Our nation shares a monarch with Sweden, and our fates are bound closely. Therefore, we will develop our military towards fulfilling the needs of Sweden and operating in concert with the Swedish army. Together our armies will develop our technologies and doctrines to prove our worth in the modern world."
 NOR_focus_train_with_sweden: "Training With Sweden"
 NOR_focus_train_with_sweden_desc: "In order to achieve the practical aspects of our cooperation with Sweden we will begin joint training and drills with the Swedish army. These efforts should allow our armies to be prepared to operate in concert on a battlefield, as well as ensuring the soldiers are less likely to have conflict due to increased familiarity."
 NOR_focus_independent_army: "Demand an Independent Army!"
 NOR_focus_independent_army_desc: "Although we may be a partner with Sweden, sharing a King, we do not need to dissolve our sovereignty further by gradually merging even our armies together. Instead we will have an army of Norwegians for Norway. Exactly what we will use this independent army for will have to be seen in the future."
 NOR_focus_develop_training_standards: "Develop Our Own Training Standards"
 NOR_focus_develop_training_standards_desc: ""
 NOR_focus_kammerloader_modernization: "Kammerloader Modernization"
 NOR_focus_kammerloader_modernization_desc: "The Kammerloader is a uniquely Norwegian rifle, and it has served us well for many years. Rather than rashly throw away such a weapon, we should improve and modernize aspects of the rifle. This should provide us with the minimal interruption to our military, and save our budget the cost of the adoption of a new rifle."
 NOR_focus_chassepot_rifle: "Chassepot Rifle"
 NOR_focus_chassepot_rifle_desc: "The French chassepot is a truly revolutionary rifle, with its functions being in many ways more advanced than the Dreyse needle rifle, another well-known bolt action rifle. Adopting this rifle will grant our army a very powerful rifle, used by one of the most powerful nations in the world. However, the demands of the French military may make receiving enough rifles difficult, and we may not receive enough rifles for several years."
 NOR_focus_remington_rifle: "Remington Rifle"
 NOR_focus_remington_rifle_desc: "The American Remington is an extremely unique rifle, well-known for its durability. Its use is strong and simple, and the weapon is very reliable. In addition, we will most likely produce the rifle under license granting us the ability to produce rifles according to our own needs."

 NOR_focus_foreign_doctrines: "Foreign Doctrines"
 NOR_focus_foreign_doctrines_desc: "Our nation unfortunately lacks practical experience and is very small in size. To remedy this we will need to rely on foreign support, bringing expertise and modern theory to our army. There are many options that we could rely on for foreign support, but the Swedes, the French, and the Americans are our most likely candidates. The Swedes are our masters, the French are a juggernaut, and the Amercians are a rising star. Who fits our nation's destiny the best?"
 NOR_focus_our_master: "Our Master"
 NOR_focus_our_master_desc: "While the Swedes may not have the most modern military, our relations and their long military history mean ignoring them would be foolish. Our proximity makes  training both very efficient and easy for both nations, as well as making the training possible at all levels rather than purely within an officer corps. Perhaps the Swedes lack the experience of other nations, but they are uniquely situated to overhaul our entire army."
 NOR_focus_expand_royal_guard: "Expand The Royal Guard"
 NOR_focus_expand_royal_guard_desc: "As part of our arrangement with Sweden, we will expand the number of troops we provide to the Royal Guard. These elite soldiers will offer a model for all of our other soldiers to emulate, as well serving as the embodiment of the integration of our army with Swedens, with a fully shared command structure overseeing both the Swedish and Norwegian elements of the force."
 NOR_focus_send_officers_kalberg: "Send Officers to Kalberg"
 NOR_focus_send_officers_kalberg_desc: "Karlberg is the oldest military academy in the world, and as such has much to offer our nations officers. By having our officers trained at Karlberg we can benefit from the extensive knowledge available, improving the expertise of many of our officers and possibly allowing for greater specialization. Alongside this benefit, our officers will be better able to cooperate with Swedish officers owing both to good relations and shared training. This will benefit us both on the battlefield and politically."
 NOR_focus_french_inspiration: "French Inspiration"
 NOR_focus_french_inspiration_desc: "France is one of the most powerful states on the planet, and their history of victories is one of the most extensive. The legacy of Napoleon is still strong, and yet they have made their own way adopting much of their military to more modern needs and methods. By receiving French training we can not only gain a connection to this great history, but also have some of the experience of their officers and soldiers imparted onto our own military."
 NOR_focus_french_style: "Adopt French Style"
 NOR_focus_french_style_desc: "The distinct style of the French military is immediately recognizable to many, and it's worth has shown itself many times as parts of it are adopted across the world by militaries from Greece to America. Let us adopt this style as well, granting our soldiers better uniforms, as well as saving us much of the effort that would be required with designing our own."
 NOR_focus_french_advisors: "French Advisors"
 NOR_focus_french_advisors_desc: "As part of our training with the French, we will invite permanent advisors to assist us in our reforms. The advisors will take their place in our military, allowing us to cooperate with the French permanently, and helping to improve a wide range of aspects of our military. These relations may be all it takes to protect our country, as the mere mention of France may scare off some who would have aims for us."
 NOR_focus_across_atlantic: "Look Across the Atlantic"
 NOR_focus_across_atlantic_desc: "Some of the most innovative methods of warfare and technologies have originated in America. If we receive training and assistance from the USA we could make use of many of these advancements, and possibly even find ourselves ahead of much of Europe. Our military lacks the scale of many of our neighbors, but if we can make up for this with technology our nation could be far safer."
 NOR_focus_lessons_acw: "Learn From the Civil War"
 NOR_focus_lessons_acw_desc: "The American Civil War is of a scale that hasn't been seen in the Americas or Europe for many years, and it employs some of the most advanced technologies available. By employing officers experienced in this war, as well as observing the merits of the technologies utilized we can gain knowledge with which to overhaul our military."
 NOR_focus_army_telegraph: "Army Telegraphs"
 NOR_focus_army_telegraph_desc: "The telegraph and its applications in the military have been pioneered by the Americans, and its worth is crystal clear. It can allow us to have our soldiers spread across the nation and yet ready to mobilize at previously impossible speeds. While they will still need time to travel, merely saving the time on communication makes our ability to prepare for war far faster. The applications of this technology can put our nation above our enemies, and grants us a chance to respond to any threat long before our enemy expects."
 NOR_focus_traditionalism: "Traditionalism"
 NOR_focus_traditionalism_desc: "The way forward our training has offered is rooted in centuries of tradition, and represents the culmination of centuries of knowledge. It has brought countless victories to our neighbors, and should offer this same chance to us. In addition, our nation is one that has not had a stance nearly as belligerent as other nearby nations, having rarely engaged in warfare. Efforts meant to bring our nation to the modern methods of warfare may simply waste our limited funds."
 NOR_focus_look_to_future: "Look to the Future"
 NOR_focus_look_to_future_desc: "Perhaps Norway is a nation at peace today, but the future can never truly be predicted. Preempting the possibility of warfare, and creating an army that will be able to at least compete if not overcome our enemies may be essential to ensuring its very existence. While it may be expensive, isn't any price worth paying for the sack of Norway?"
 NOR_focus_our_own_twist: "Our Own Twist"
 NOR_focus_our_own_twist_desc: "Despite the support we have received from abroad, our needs are still unique and we must make changes to our structure to operate at our nation's scale and with our strategic needs in mind. Particular methods of recruitment and our most important cities and locations have not yet been addressed with our reforms. Resolving these hanging threads will bring to a close many of our reforms."
 NOR_focus_rural_recruitment: "Rural Recruitment"
 NOR_focus_rural_recruitment_Desc: "Norway lacks much of the urban population that is assumed when conscription and other modern methods of recruitment are considered. Instead, our nation consists largely of rural populations spread across it. To ensure that we can have enough manpower to protect our nation and provide for our needs we will focus much of our recruitment efforts on these rural areas."
 NOR_focus_expand_kongsberg: "Expand Kongsberg"
 NOR_focus_expand_kongsberg_desc: "Kongsberg is our nation's largest weapons company, and offers an opportunity to produce not only enough weapons for our own nation but possibly even enough for export. The innovative engineers at Kongsberg can represent the future of Norwegian arms, but they will require proper support. To this end we will help to expand the company further to meet our nation's needs."
 NOR_focus_build_forts: "Fortify Major Cities"
 NOR_focus_build_forts_desc: "While Norway may not be a nation of cities, the cities that we do have are essential to the very existence of our nation. With the capture of only a few cities our army would be lost and in immense danger. To prevent this possibility we will begin to fortify our cities, turning part of them into fortresses that will protect our nation from any threat."

 NOR_focus_norwegian_navy: "The Norwegian Navy"
 NOR_focus_norwegian_navy_desc: "Founded upon our union with Sweden, our navy has long been underfunded and neglected. However, changes abroad and internally have made this state of affairs untenable. Reforms are necessary, and by making necessary changes we can defend our own coasts properly, and perhaps go even further than just that."

 NOR_focus_monitors: "Monitors"
 NOR_focus_monitors_desc: "Norway is a nation with a massive coastline, but our most important areas are in our south near Oslo. To properly defend our lands from the evolving might of other navies we must build a navy, and monitors perfectly fit this need."
 NOR_focus_american_tech: "American Technology"
 NOR_focus_american_tech_desc: "The Americans have made significant advances in naval technology, particularly in monitor ships. Cooperation with the Americans will allow us to utilize their technology to hasten our own advancements. "
 NOR_focus_american_monitors: "American Monitors"
 NOR_focus_american_monitors_desc: "Building off of our previous engagements with the Americans will allow us to purchase Monitors directly. A rapid influx of ships will greatly bolster the power of our navy, and it will allow our own dockyards to focus their efforts on other types of production."
 NOR_focus_swedish_norwegian_coop: "Swedish-Norwegian Cooperation"
 NOR_focus_swedish_norwegian_coop_desc: "As the sister nation to Sweden, cooperation between our naval industries is only natural. Sweden may not be the foremost naval power, but our industries have such close links that further cooperation will improve both of our abilities to defend our coasts in cooperation with each other."
 NOR_focus_john_ericson: "John Ericson"
 NOR_focus_john_ericson_desc: "John Ericson, a Swedish-American engineer, was one of the leading engineers for the creations of the monitors. While he has resided in the United States for many years, with an expansion to both our and Sweden's naval production he may return to Scandinavia and benefit his birth nation."
 NOR_focus_skorpionen_klasse: "HNoMS Skorpionen"
 NOR_focus_skorpionen_klasse_desc: "We will construct our own native class of monitor ships to meet our military needs. These efforts will help establish the experience and ability of our naval facilities, as well as keeping the expenses mostly within Norway rather than being sent to a foreig nation to fund the construction. May there be many like it!"
 NOR_focus_thor_klasse: "HNoMS Thor"
 NOR_focus_thor_klasse_desc: "The HNoMS is a significant improvement on her predecessor the HNoMS Skorpionen, improving on the armor, armament, and propulsion. While the Skorpionen Class served us well, ships modeled after Thor will be superior in all the ways we need, and could serve our needs for many years."

 NOR_focus_kong_sverre: "Kong Sverre"
 NOR_focus_kong_sverre_desc: "Capitalizing on the huge advancements made with recent naval technology, we will construct a new frigate to add greater firepower to our navy. By utilizing the huge number of advancements in ship construction and propulsion, we can show Europe that Norway aims for greater heights."
 NOR_focus_expand_karljohansvern: "Expand Karljohansvern"
 NOR_focus_expand_karljohansvern_desc: "Karljohansvern is the primary base for the Royal Norwegian Navy, but its current state is not fitting for our plans. It will need to be expanded and refitted to modern standards for us to truly make use of it for our new naval needs, otherwise our current plans will not be possible."
 NOR_focus_iron_warships: "Iron Warships"
 NOR_focus_iron_warships_desc: "Modern naval technology has made wooden warships obsolete as warships. Their only use is against enemies without the technologies to breach their armor. Therefore, to maintain the relevance of our navy we must build a navy of iron warships. With proper armor our ships will be able to hold their own and prove their worth."
 NOR_focus_armstrong_guns: "Armstrong Guns"
 NOR_focus_armstrong_guns_desc: "The British Armstrong gun has shown itself to be an extremely powerful weapon, and its adoption could bolster the ability of our ships. While its use will require more training for our crews, the benefits that these guns can offer our navy should outfit and additional training."
 NOR_focus_ecucate_cadets_abroad: "Educate Cadets Abroad"
 NOR_focus_ecucate_cadets_abroad_desc: "The navies of the Baltic sea have become increasingly second rate, and so to gain an education for our officers that will be truly competitive we must send them to the foremost naval powers of this day. By observing the might of the navies we will see what navies can be capable of, and plot a course for our own navy based on this knowledge."
 NOR_focus_send_cadets_to_sweden: "Send Cadets to Sweden"
 NOR_focus_send_cadets_to_sweden_desc: "While our navy is seperate from the Swedish navy, unlike the days under the Danes, our nations are closely aligned. By leaning into this relationship and helping it to develop we can strengthen both of our navies and place our navies into a position to be the dominant force in the Baltic."
 NOR_focus_radio_telegraphs: "Naval Radio Telegraphs"
 NOR_focus_radio_telegraphs_desc: "With our improvements in most other fields of military technology, communications have often been neglected. Adopting methods for our ships to communicate with each other with greater information, accuracy, and speed. Most importantly, it will keep our coasts more secure."

 NOR_focus_gunboats: "Gunboats"
 NOR_focus_gunboats_desc: "While monitors provide our defense for areas directly on our coast, our goals further afield, and in rougher waters, require a different kind of ship. For this reason, we will build up a fleet of gunboats which can both support our foreign policy and defend our national waters."
 NOR_focus_foreign_designs: "Foreign Designs"
 NOR_focus_foreign_designs_desc: "America, Britain, and France are the foremost naval powers of our day. However, many designers for the ships of these great powers navies are willing to assist our navy by providing new or similar designs. This can allow us to adopt designs from proven designers and of proven value, without risk."
 NOR_focus_new_engines: "New Engines"
 NOR_focus_new_engines_desc: "One of the most rapidly advancing fields in naval technology is that of propulsion, as more powerful, more efficient engines and methods of propulsion are developed. By purchasing those designs from foreign nations we can keep ourselves at or near the forefront of development, without the risk of failure or possibly even dangerous inferior designs."
 NOR_focus_norwegian_designs: "Norwegian Designs"
 NOR_focus_norwegian_designs_desc: "While there is great value in many nations' naval designs no one can understand Norwegian needs better than Norwegians. Our nation relies on our merchant navy for much of our economy, providing us with a potential source for ship designers. By developing our own designs we can build a navy that shows the independent power of Norway, rather than our dependence on other nations."
 NOR_focus_home_engines: "Homemade Engines"
 NOR_focus_home_engines_desc: "Rather than allow the native talents of Norway to rot away while foreign designers grow rich off our funds, funding the development of native designs for ships will prove its worth in the long term. Whatever the actual value of the designs, creating a native industry of naval designs could assist our economy, as well as possibly provide our navy with the edge it needs for our goals."
 NOR_focus_patrol_coast: "Protect the Norwegian Coast"
 NOR_focus_patrol_coast_desc: "The first and foremost role of our gunboats and monitors is the guarding of the Norwegian coast. If any nation plans to attack Norway, they may be able to overwhelm some parts of our navy at sea. But by relying on our coastal fleets and their capabilities we can mitigate the dangers that can befall us even if we are defeated."
 NOR_focus_gunboat_modernization: "Gunboat Modernization"
 NOR_focus_gunboat_modernization_desc: "Considering our reliance on them, keeping our coastal defense ships as modern as possible must always be our priority with our navy. As this mostly manifests itself with gunboats, improving these ships must be a priority for our development and refitting efforts."

 ###Decisions###
 NOR_decision_category_sami_opression: "History of Sami Oppression"
 NOR_decision_category_sami_opression_desc: "Ever since Norway assimilated the lands of the Sami, the Norwegian government has opressed them, straining relations between the indigenous Sami and the settling Norwegians. The Sami people have long been subject to racial discrimination and oppression; their lands seized and destroyed by the industrializing Norway.\n\nIn Nothern-Norway, most of the inland areas are predominantly inhabited by Sami raindeer herders, while the coast is predominantly settled by Norwegian fishermen. Although, a significant part of indigenous peoples also depend on fishing.\n\nIt is important to secure these areas as integral parts of Norway, and rid the areas of their primal religions. Only this way we are in a position to claim the area as ours."
 NOR_decision_category_worker_unrest: "Worker Unrest"
 NOR_decision_category_worker_unrest_desc: "The urban working class arguable has the worst living conditions in this country. Even though Norway barely has a peasant class, high birthrates and lower infant mortality have caused a massive surge in population, a development that isn't slowing down. Rural areas can no longer sustain the massive surge of people, which lead many to emigrate to America. But a far larger portion decide to move to the industrialising cities, into cramped tenements with little garanteed work.\n\nAlthough, Norway has a significant electorate, landless peoples are excluded from the vote, which means the growing labourer class has no political representation. Recently, the Thrane-movement caused uproar, forming unions and creating socialist newspapers. In 1850, a petition backed by a group as large as our whole electorate was given King Oscar I with radical proposals such as all-male sufferage. The King refused to act on the proposal, and as a respons workers formed an assembly to challenge the Storting, the Lilleting, but its leaders were arrested to prevent revolution. In response, worker societies led by agents of the state were established to control labourers political activities.\n\nWe should prevent revolts and riots, but also try to use as little money on this as possible.\n\n§YWorker Unrest: [?NOR_var_worker_unrest|%R]§!"

 eoanb_norway.1.t: "Vernepliktsdebatten"
 eoanb_norway.1.d: "Vernepliktsdebatten, a discussion on conscription in the armed forces. The discussion is between two parts of the Norwegian political sphere, the technocrats and the autocrats. It has become very political because of the proposed inclusion of the city population in the military."
 eoanb_norway.1.a: "Interesting"

 eoanb_norway.2.t: "The Murder of Knut Grøte"
 eoanb_norway.2.d: "On 10 August 1863 Knut Grøte was murdered by Friedrich Priess and Knud Simonsen from Prussia and Denmark. Today, the Norwegian supreme court sentenced both to death. Maybe this will scare off all the other filthy criminals?"
 eoanb_norway.2.a: "How could such a thing happen?"

 eoanb_norway.3.t: "Construction Started On The Storting Building"
 eoanb_norway.3.d: "After much planning, construction of the Storting has started. A design competition was held in 1856, and after a vote in the Storting, the submission by Swedish architect Emil Victor Langlet was chosen as the final design of the building.\nSince 1854, the parliament has been using a conference room in the Royal Fredrick University, and the people's representatives are surely happy to finally move out once it is complete."
 eoanb_norway.3.a: "Very well"
 eoanb_norway.3.b: "About time!"

 eoanb_norway.4.t: "The Storting Building is Completed"
 eoanb_norway.4.d: "After roughly five and a half years of construction, the storting building is complete. This marks a significant step towards Norwegian independence. Before this, the Storting used a conference hall in the Royal Fredrick University.\nThis building is an artifact of the stable Norwegian regime, and will undoubtedly be a popular tourist attraction in the coming years."
 eoanb_norway.4.a: "Very well"

 eoanb_norway.5.t: "Venstre Has Been Established"
 eoanb_norway.5.d: "As the first formal political party in Norway, it will mark the start of a new era in Norwegian democracy. Venstre, literally \"Left\", is made up of MP's wanting to reform the Norwegian democracy. Its leader, Johan Sverdrup, has a goal of implementing parliamentarism in the Storting, but is met with strong opposition from the conservative members of parliament. \nInformal political parties have existed in the Storting before this, but have been limited to just that, informal political parties. Hopefully this will make it easier to know who to vote for."
 eoanb_norway.5.a: "Interesting."

 eoanb_norway.6.t: "Høyre Has Been Established"
 eoanb_norway.6.d: "In reaction to Venstre being established earlier this year, the conservative members of parliament has decided to form their own political party. Høyre, literally \"Right\", is mostly made up of businessmen and powerful leaders. Representing conservative people in Norway, it will work against the proposals of Venstre, with a possibility of cooperation with the moderate wing of Venstre."
 eoanb_norway.6.a: "Very well."

 eoanb_norway.7.t: "Vogt Pressured By the Swedish Crown"
 eoanb_norway.7.d: "Jørgen Herman Vogt, government leader since 1855 has been pressured by the King of Sweden to resign. This is because Vogt had a conflict with the king over his military appointments, and is now threatening Vogts position as leader of government."
 eoanb_norway.7.a: "Call a vote in the Storting."
 eoanb_norway.7.b: "Vogt needs to resign."

 eoanb_norway.8.t: "Who Should Be Vogt's Successor?"
 eoanb_norway.8.d: "After Vogt's resignation we are left with an obvious question; Who should be his successor? Several prominent politicians have come with their own proposals, as well as the King of Sweden. Who should be his successor?"
 eoanb_norway.8.a: "The Crown Prince of Sweden Charles XV"
 eoanb_norway.8.b: "Conservative Hans Christian Petersen"

 eoanb_norway.9.t: "Jørgen Herman Vogt Gets to Keep His Power"
 eoanb_norway.9.d: "After about two months of discourse Jørgen Herman Vogt, and his friends in the Storting have voted against the choice of the king. The king has no obligation to act upon the advice of the Storting, but has chosen to accept its terms because he does not want to upset the Norwegian populace."
 eoanb_norway.9.a: "Very well"

 eoanb_norway.10.t: "Jørgen Herman Vogt is Forced to Resign"
 eoanb_norway.10.d: "Today, the Norwegian Head of Government officially resigned as a consequence of Swedish pressure. The Swedish King may celebrate as he successfully cleared space for his friend Christian Birch-Reichenwald in the government. Birch-Reichenwald has long been a good friend of King Charles XV, and is probably wanted because Vogt has been critical of some of the King's military appointments. Vogt's age may also be a factor concerning the demand, as the aging politician is at this point in his 70's."
 eoanb_norway.10.a: "Not much we can do"

 eoanb_norway.11.t: "The End of The Feud"
 eoanb_norway.11.d: "The current political feud is officially over, and we have successfully chosen our preferred leader. Although, even if this conflict has been solved, there are still some major conflicts in this country. \nThese revolve mainly around the minority group of \"embedsmenn\" who dominate the Norwegian political landscape. Nevertheless, we may now relax and watch what is happening in the world; at least for the time being."
 eoanb_norway.11.a: "Very well!"

 eoanb_norway.12.t: "Opening of Hamar-Grundsetbanen"
 eoanb_norway.12.d: "In 1857, together with Kongsvingerbanen and Trondhjem-Størenbanen, construction of Hamar-Grundsetbanen was approved in the Storting, and is now the first one of the railways to be completed. The next railway, Kongsvingerbanen is expected to open soon."
 eoanb_norway.12.a: "Splendid"

 eoanb_norway.13.t: "Opening of Kongsvingerbanen"
 eoanb_norway.13.d: "Some time after the completion and opening of Hamar-Grundsetbanen, Kongsvingerbanen has officially opened. In contrast to the previous railway, this is the first one to use the standard-gauge rail, as it uses a smaller gauge. Anyway, this is a small improvement of the infrastructure in Norway; even if large parts of the country still lack railways."
 eoanb_norway.13.a: "Very well"

 eoanb_norway.14.t: "Great Christiania Fire"
 eoanb_norway.14.d: "A fire has broken out in the center of our capital. The fire is reported to have started at night, and quickly spread to the nearby houses. Luckily, nobody is reported to have been hurt.\nWhat should be our next move?"
 eoanb_norway.14.a: "Do nothing"
 eoanb_norway.14.b: "Help them a little bit"
 eoanb_norway.14.c: "Send them all we got"

 eoanb_norway.15.t: "Repairing Takes Longer Time Than Expected"
 eoanb_norway.15.d: "Since the we put few resources into the reparation of the capital city, progress is slow, and our advisors require that we send some help. Sending support is the better option, but if we want to save our resources we should let the people help themselves, at the cost of some legitimacy."
 eoanb_norway.15.a: "Insist on doing nothing"
 eoanb_norway.15.b: "Send some help"

 eoanb_norway.16.t: "Christiania Repaired"
 eoanb_norway.16.d: "After a while of reparation, the areas affected by the fire has finished reparation."
 eoanb_norway.16.a: "Wonderful"

 eoanb_norway.17.t: "Election of 1859"
 eoanb_norway.17.d: "The 16th Storting election has been announced, deciding the fate of the representatives in the Norwegian Parliament. Individuals are voted for in the largest election to date, with electoral seats being expanded from 111 to 117. A conflict between the more liberal minded Bønder (Farmers) and the more staunchly conservative Embedsmenn (Officials) has been the topic of debate as of recent. With more seats in parliament after the addition of the 57th clause in the Norwegian constitution, farmers now have 2 representatives in parliament for every 1 representative of townsfolk. With this in mind, many of the more rural people in Norway banded together to form proto-political parties, namely the Reformforeningen (Reform Association), a group of liberal opposition politicians against the more conservative population. On the other side are the conservatives, a group of civil servants and government officials who have dominated Norwegian politics since 1814. With every county voting for their own representatives, the question now looms, who has won the majority of the seats? The more liberal-minded Bønder, or the more conservative Embedsmenn?"
 eoanb_norway.17.a: "Liberals"
 eoanb_norway.17.b: "Conservatives"

 eoanb_norway.18.t: "The Situation in Northern Norway"
 eoanb_norway.18.d: "Northern Norway remains one of many lesser known and talked about states in Europe. With the last few centuries consisting of controversy and emigration, Northern Norway has only recently begun recovering from the centuries of harsh trade laws. This was in large part thanks to the Napoleonic Wars, and its effects on the region's trade monopolies. As a result, the region became newly economically viable in the eyes of trade, consequently causing a large growth spurt in interest and immigration to the region. The region remains mainly Norwegian by population, however a fishing crisis in the 17th century forced many away from the region, allowing the Sami people and culture to flourish once more. This was quickly followed by a small series of immigrants from Finland and Russians who were interested in trade and land in the region. Today, Northern Norway stands as a quiet but actively growing region of Europe, with new cities popping up once every few decades."

 eoanb_norway.21.c: "We can't spare that much"

 eoanb_norway.22.t: "The Issue of Stattholder"
 eoanb_norway.22.d: "After the short Swedish-Norwegian war of 1814 ended with Norway being forced into the Union between Sweden and Norway the governor-general of Norway was appointed by the King of Norway and Sweden. The Norwegian Constitution stipulated that a governor-general of Swedish or Norwegian nationality could be appointed but during the first 15 years of the union the title were held by Swedes only, which caused resentment among the Norwegians.\nAfter 1829 the post was held by Norwegians until 1856 when it was left vacant until its abolition in 1873.\nDespite being forced into the union with Sweden, Norway kept its own Constitution and parliament. To amend the fact that Norway and Sweden had two different constitutions, with the Norwegian one being more democratic, the Act of Union (Riksakten) was negotiated between Swedish and Norwegian delegations in the spring of 1815. The Act of Union dealt with the king's authority, the relationship between the legislatures, how executive power was to be exercised in the event of the King's death before the Crown prince had attained majority and the relationship between the cabinets. The Act of Union also stated that issues regarding foreign policy was decided by the Swedish cabinet with the Norwegian Prime Minister present.\nThe union was not frictionless however, when King Charles XIV Johan ascended the throne in 1818, he tried to strengthen the executive power which were resisted by the Norwegian parliament. Up until his death in 1844, the King repeatedly demanded to every parliament that his veto power should absolute, like in Sweden, instead of the suspended veto he had in Norway. It was rejected every time.\nThe question of national symbols was another subject that caused friction and wasn't resolved until after the accession of King Oscar I in 1844 when a joint committee were enacted regarding flags and coat of arms. This resulted in parallel flag systems that manifested the equality between the countries.\nRight now, the future looks bright for the union but there is potential trouble ahead. The position of governor-general has been vacant since 1856 and the question is if a new person should be appointed, or should it be abolished all together?\nAbolishment would certainly be popular among the Norwegians which would see that as further proof of Norway been an equal partner to Sweden but how would the more conservative Swedish parliament and cabinet react who sees Norway as an inferior partner and a prize of war?"

 NOR_idea_swedish_norwegian_union: "Swedish-Norwegian Union"
 NOR_idea_swedish_norwegian_union_desc: "The Treaty of Kiel was concluded on January 14, 1814, between Sweden and Denmark. It was forced by the Swedish heir to the throne Karl Johan, who was commander-in-chief of the Allied Northern Army in the war against Napoleon I.\n\nAfter the battle of Leipzig in 1813, Karl Johan returned to Denmark with his army. According to the peace treaty in Kiel, the King of Denmark was to cede Norway to the King of Sweden, while Sweden ceded Swedish Pomerania and Rügen to Denmark, as well as paying one million riksdaler to Denmark in turn. According to the first draft of the peace treaty, the entirety of Norway would be transferred to Sweden, in the final treaty, however, the Norwegian colonies of Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands were excluded, which now instead became Danish. This fact caused great anger among many people in Norway.\n\nOn May 17, 1814, the Norwegian constitution (based on Montesquieu's idea of the separation of powers) was adopted in Eidsvoll. After that, the elected assembly elected the Danish crown prince Kristian Fredrik (later Kristian VIII of Denmark) as King of Norway. But lacking foreign support, the new regime could not withstand Karl Johan's demands for the fulfillment of the Kiel Treaty, and after a short military intervention had to back down.\n\nAt the Convention of Moss on 14 August, a ceasefire was concluded, and King Kristian Fredrik agreed to an abdication, so that Norway would be allowed to keep its constitution under a personal union with Sweden. Kristian Fredrik abdicated and left the country on October 10 after handing over government power to the Storting.\nOn November 4, 1814, the Norwegian Storting and the Swedish negotiators agreed on the terms and a revised Norwegian constitution was adopted. Charles XIII (reigning in Norway as Charles II) was elected King of Norway. According to the Union Treaty, Norway would be united with Sweden in a union as its own kingdom with its own laws and ordinances but with a common royal house and a common foreign policy led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Stockholm."

 NOR_idea_storting: "The Norwegian Storting"
 NOR_idea_storting_desc: "The Storting, an institution founded with the 1814 constitution. As the Norwegian parliament, it represents a free Norway without the influence of the Swedish.\nIt is divided into two chambers: the Lagting, the upper house and court of impeachment, and the Odelsting, the lower house and legislative chamber. After an election, 3/4 of the elected representatives join the Odelsting while 1/4 join the Lagting. Because both chambers are filled with representatives from the same election, there are rarely any ideological difference between the two. Therefore, most bills that are sent to the Lagting are mostly approved without any revisions."

 NOR_idea_samis: "An Oppressed Ethnic Group"
 NOR_idea_samis_desc: "The Sami are a nomadic people living in northern Europe. The territory they live on spans four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, with the majority of Samis residing within our borders. Their lifestyle is very different from the western-style Norwegian lifestyle, which puts them at odds with the Norwegian settlers, especially when it comes to natural resources.\nEven though they are mostly peaceful, the Norwegians have shown little mercy towards their people, whom they deem inferior.\nThe land they live on is filled with metals and other natural resources sitting ready for exploitation, and due to a blossoming of nationalist thought, the Samis have been put through a process of assimilation and segregation, as a part of a program called Norwegianization.\nUnjust or not, this is certainly not showing any signs of stopping, and the future of Sami culture isn't very bright."

 NOR_idea_embedsmannstaten: "Embedsmannstaten"
 NOR_idea_embedsmannstaten_desc: "According to the constitution of 1814, Norway is a democracy with clear seperation of powers and popular sovereignty, although in reality it is much closer to an autocracy. This is because the country is controlled by a powerful ruling class in servitude the Swedish king. The constitution grants the King powers to appoint the Prime Minister of his choice, without any oversight by the parliament or the people. Looking at all of these things together, it is pretty obvious that Norway is a puppet of the Swedish Crown, but only because of the kings influence over Norwegian politics. Although the King is vested with a near absolute amount of power, there exists an organized opposition to Swedish rule. Rural farmers and liberal business owners have been fighting for more self-determination, parliamentary sovereignty over government, and some, even full independence."

 NOR_idea_emigration: "Massive Emigration"
 NOR_idea_emigration_desc: "Because of high birthrates in Norway and lower infant mortality, rural communites are at their absolute upper limit of how many people they're able to sustain, forcing many to find another place to live.\nNorwegian cities have little to offer as there are few jobs with little pay and horrible working conditions. Because of this, a lot of healthy and young Norwegians decide to move to America. Although this alleviates problems in the short-term, long term growth is hampered if we don't do anything."
