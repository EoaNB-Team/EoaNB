### STARTING, GENERAL INFO AND FLAVOUR EVENTS
#STARTING EVENTS
saxony.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Saxony –\nStarting Situation: Domestic Policy"
saxony.1.d:0 "\n[SAX.GetNameDef] has been heavily involved in the revolutionary uprisings of 1830 and 1848/49. Public pressure mainly exerted by intellectuals and academics in Leipzig and Dresden led to the adoption of a relatively progressive constitution in 1831, which turned the kingdom into a constitutional monarchy, including public elections for the second chamber of the Landtag.\n\nIn the meantime, the [SAX.GetName] was the first country in Germany to experience the rapid changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution. Primarily around the cities of Chemnitz and Zwickau, a large number of factories were built, mainly specialized in the textile and mechanical engineering industry. With that arose a new social class: the industrial proletariat, which grew increasingly unhappy with the poor labor conditions and a lack of political representation.\n\nFueled by general unhappiness and high unemployment, Saxony was one of the centers of the March Revolution of 1848/49. Violent outbursts forced the king to change the government multiple times, appoint more progressive ministers, end press censorship, and liberalize suffrage laws. As the forces of reaction tried to take back control, bloody street battles ensued after the king had dissolved the Landtag and Prussian troops intervened in Dresden, leaving several hundreds dead. The forces loyal to the crown eventually prevailed, and most of the concessions were revoked.\n\n[SAX.GetNameDef] now finds itself at a crossroads. Whilst aristocrats are clinging on to their privileges, the public demands progress and liberalization, and there's also the question how to handle growing nationalist sentiments among the Sorbs. It will be important to find a balance, develop our economy, and ensure another revolt is prevented, if we want Saxony to thrive and prosper."
saxony.1.a:0 "Glück auf, Glück auf, mein Sachsenland!"
saxony.2.t:0 "The Kingdom of Saxony –\nStarting Situation: Foreign Affairs"
saxony.2.d:0 "\n[SAX.GetNameDef] is in a difficult position geographically. Sandwiched between the two German hegemons, the [PRS.GetName] and the [AUS.GetName], and bordering the third German power, the [BAV.GetName] to the south, the government will have to tread carefully, especially within the German Confederation.\n\nWhilst membership in the Zollverein is of vital economic importance, our relationship to the Zollverein's leading power, Prussia, has not been the best in recent times. In fact, Saxony had nearly been annexed completely by the [PRS.GetName] during the Vienna Congress of 1815, as a punishment for siding with Napoleon until the last minute.\n\nOnly the intervention of the [AUS.GetName] prevented the complete incorporation of our kingdom into the Prussian state back then, but we still lost over half of our territory and nearly 40% of our population as part of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna. The days when we were considered a European middle power are over, and we only barely managed to prevent the Prussian unification initiative after the March Revolution, known as the Erfurt Union.\n\nWe will have to decide how to proceed from here. We made some promising progress working with the other German minors lately and continuing down this path should be our best option, although it might be hard to get all parties involved on the same page. At the same time we should be careful not to antagonize Austria and Prussia, or our days as an independent country could be numbered..."
saxony.2.a:0 "Gott sei mit dir, mein Sachsenland!"
#GENERAL INFORMATION AND FLAVOR EVENTS
saxony.11.t:0 "The Discovery of the Element Indium"
saxony.11.d:0 "Two scientists from the Bergakademie Freiberg have made a remarkable discovery: while conducting spectral analyses on black zinc, they came across a new element. Due to its indigo blue spectral colour, they named the new element indium."
saxony.11.a:0 "We can be proud of our scientists."
saxony.12.t:0 "Foundation of the Zwickau Brewing Association"
saxony.12.d:0 "Industrialists from Zwickau who are familiar with beer brewing have founded the Zwickauer Brauverein a few days ago. The association has set itself the goal of establishing a jointly managed brewery in Zwickau to meet the beer needs of the surrounding area with freshly brewed local beer."
saxony.12.a:0 "Many sure are looking forward to it."
saxony.13.t:0 "Foundation of the Zwickau Association Brewery"
saxony.13.d:0 "Entrepreneurs from the Zwickau Brewing Association laid the foundation stone for the first Zwickau association brewery today. Beer brewing will be able to begin here in a few months. The combined expertise of the members of the brewing association gives reason to hope that the beer brewed here will be of exceptional quality."
saxony.13.a:0 "Let's quickly collect the taxes - and some sample!"
saxony.14.t:0 "The Dresden Striezelmarkt"
saxony.14.d:0 "The Dresden Christmas market, better known as 'Striezelmarkt', is a prestigious event in the run-up to Christmas. Hundreds of traders from all over Saxony come to Dresden in December to sell their goods. The Saxon royal family can also be seen here. Although there has been criticism in recent years due to the increased volume of traffic, the Striezelmarkt is a firm institution in Dresden."
saxony.14.a:0 "Can't wait to try the famous Christmas cake!"
saxony.15.t:0 "Striezelmarkt to Leave Traditional Location"
saxony.15.d:0 "The Dresden Striezelmarkt has to vacate its traditional location on the Altmarkt. The Dresden city council came to this decision after increasing criticism in recent years regarding the obstruction of traffic and the simplicity of the stalls, which allegedly did not fit in with the city centre. The traders now have to move to the side streets or another location."
saxony.15.a:0 "Surely a controversial decision."

###POLITICAL AND WAR EVENTS
#DOMESTIC POLITICS
saxony.201.t:0 "Ferdinand von Zschinsky Terminally Ill - Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust Appointed Acting Prime Minister"
saxony.201.d:0 "Prime Minister von Zschinsky had already been in bad health for roughly two years when he embarked on convalescent leave to Southern France and Italy earlier this year, as requested by King Johann. According to the doctors, the prime minister is suffering from a chronic lung condition that can only be cured by a change of climate. The journey did not, however, significantly improve his health, and von Zschinsky returned to Dresden three weeks ago. Earlier today, sad news reached king and parliament: von Zschinsky has fallen dangerously sick and will be unable to carry out his ministerial duties for the foreseeable future. The doctor in charge of von Zschinsky's therapy has made no secret of his doubts whether the prime minister will recover at all...\n\nHis Majesty, King Johann, has already appointed von Zschinsky's longstanding political adversary, foreign minister Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust, as Acting Prime Minister. Von Beust is known for his liberal-conservative agenda and wants to put Saxony back on the diplomatic map of Europe. Von Zschinsky's deteriorating health might have initiated a significant change in Saxon politics."
saxony.201.a:0 "Zschinsky's days seem to be numbered..."
saxony.202.t:0 "Death of Ferdinand von Zschinsky"
saxony.202.d:0 "After a few days of death throes, Prime Minister Ferdinand von Zschinsky died earlier this morning. His ten years in government as head of the Ministry of the Interior and, finally, prime minister, made von Zschinsky a well-known figure in not only Saxon but also German politics. His juridical prowess also earned him the respect of his colleagues and lawmakers across Europe. A recipient of the Grand Cross of the Saxon Civil Order of Merit, the Imperial Austrian Order of the Iron Crown, and the Imperial Russian Order of Saint Anna, among others, von Zschinsky will be dearly missed and receive an honourable burial."
saxony.202.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
saxony.203.t:0 "Death of Ferdinand Lassalle"
saxony.203.d:0 "Reports are coming in that Ferdinand Lassalle has been confirmed dead. Being a devout socialist and pro-monarchist at the same time, Lassalle was an ideologically conflicting man. He maintained relations with both the arch-communist Karl Marx and the arch-monarchist Otto von Bismarck. Although some will claim that Lassalle was a communist, in the end, he was the same thing that Bismarck was: a nationalist at heart, willing to undertake any social ideology to achieve the goal of a united Germany. His untimely death will surely be a severe blow to moderate socialism in Germany, as the movement loses its most brilliant thinker."
saxony.203.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
saxony.204.t:0 "The Sorbian Question"
saxony.204.d:0 "The Sorbs are a West Slavic ethnic group predominantly inhabiting Lusatia, the northwestern part of our realm. As a result of the Vienna Congress of 1815, a large part of the Sorbian lands was seized by the [PRS.GetName], but still there are around 65,000 Sorbs living in the [SAX.GetName]. Sorbian nationalism has been on the rise lately, especially in the context of the March Revolution of 1848/49, and many Sorbian intellectuals hold Panslavic sentiments and maintain ties to other Slavic intellectuals in the east. The latest developments have been increasingly worrying and now we must decide how to proceed with the Sorbian question."
saxony.204.a:0 "We need to accept their expression of identity."
saxony.204.b:0 "We will continue to basically ignore the matter."
saxony.204.c:0 "We need to assimilate them at all costs!"
saxony.205.t:0 "Formation of the Sorbian Written Language"
saxony.205.d:0 "For centuries, the Sorbs, a West Slavic ethnic minority situated mainly in Lusatia, have mainly communicated and passed down their traditions and history orally. Although there had been written forms of the Sorbian dialects before, they were very inconsistent and mutual intelligibility was not a given. For a few decades now, Sorbian intellectuals have been working hard to establish a fixed grammar, a set of rules that govern the Sorbian language and its dialects. This has strengthened Sorbian nationalism and self-awareness, and we should expect more Sorbian literary, historiographic and linguistic publications in the future."
saxony.205.a:0 "Well, good for them."
saxony.206.t:0 "Decennial Anniversary of the Maćica Serbska"
saxony.206.d:0 "The so-called Maćica Serbska is an influential Sorbian scientific society. Founded in the Lusatian town of Bautzen in 1847, many Sorbian intellectuals like Handrij Zejler (picture) and Jan Arnošt Smoler have found and continue to find inspiration and a common cause in the advancement of the Sorbian culture in the Maćica Serbska. The society has played a key role in the establishment of a Sorbian grammar and literature and will most likely continue to function as a nucleus of Sorbian identity."
saxony.206.a:0 "We need to watch them."
saxony.207.t:0 "Serbske Nowiny - Sorbian Journal"
saxony.207.d:0 "The first Sorbian journal was established in 1842 by Handrij Zejler, who was later joined by Jan Arnošt Smoler. In 1854, the journal was renamed into 'Serbske Nowiny' - Sorbian Newspaper - and circulation has been greatly improved since then. Especially among Protestant Sorbs it exerts significant influence and we have to watch the publishers' activities closely. Our predecessors have already prohibited the paper from printing news regarding foreign affairs, and we will continue to do so for now."
saxony.207.a:0 "They need to be controlled."
saxony.208.t:0 "New Lusatian Magazine - 40th Anniversary"
saxony.208.d:0 "The New Lusatian Magazine, or 'Neues Lausitzisches Magazin', is the publication organ of the Upper Lusatian Society of the Sciences, a scholarly society based in Görlitz. Although the society and its magazine do not specifically agitate Sorbian nationalism and identity, if offers a platform to many Sorbian intellectuals, and their publications resonate with the liberal-progressive bourgeoisie in Saxony and Prussia. Let's hope the scientific advantages outweigh the dangers some of those dissidents pose."
saxony.208.a:0 "Not so new anymore, huh?"
saxony.209.t:0 "Foundation of the Katolski Posoł - Catholic Sorbian Magazine"
saxony.209.d:0 "Recently founded by Michał Hórnik, the Katolski Posoł - Catholic Herald - is a Sorbian magazine aiming specifically at Catholic Sorbs. Whilst religious in character, the magazine could also be used to secretly agitate Sorbian separatist tendencies. We should have an eye on their publications."
saxony.209.a:0 "Catholic Sorbians might also be dangerous..."
saxony.210.t:0 "Slawisches Zentralblatt - a Weekly Journal with Panslavic Tendencies"
saxony.210.d:0 "Jan Arnošt Smoler has recently established another Sorbian Journal, the 'Slawisches Zentralblatt' - Slavic Central Journal, published in German. The subtitle reads 'für Literatur, Kunst, Wissenschaft und nationale Interessen des Gesamtslawentums' - for Literature, Art, Science, and the national interests of all Slavs. Smoler does not bother to cover the Panslavic tendencies of this publication and we will have to make sure to limit and hamper its circulation."
saxony.210.a:0 "Sorbian intellectuals reaching out to Russia, alarming..."
saxony.211.t:0 "Lusatian-Lower Sorbian Dictionary Published"
saxony.211.d:0 "The Sorbian minority is linguistically very different from their German neighbours, which makes mutual intelligibility difficult. The Sorbian language, commonly referred to as 'Wendisch' in Germany, now has a dictionary that makes translations into German and vice versa much easier for people with only little knowledge of both languages. Although using this dictionary would practically enhance the importance and rank of the Wendish language, it does sound like a good opportunity for mutual rapprochement."
saxony.211.a:0 "At least we can mutually understand each other now."
saxony.212.t:0 "Second Pan-Slav Congress in Vienna"
saxony.212.d:0 "A Sorbian delegations has participated in the Second Pan-Slav Congress in Vienna earlier this year. After the first Pan-Slav Congress in Prague in 1847, nationalist and separatist agitation among Slavs reached a boiling point across Eastern Europe, including the [SAX.GetName]. We must be very careful not to let these insurgents cause trouble again. We might have to strengthen our intelligence to deal with them."
saxony.212.a:0 "These Panslavic agitators must be stopped."

#FOREIGN POLITICS AND WAR EVENTS
saxony.301.t:0 "Prusso-Saxon Relationship - Status Quo"
saxony.301.d:0 "Our relations with Prussia have been and are still troublesome, to say the least. Initially allies during the reformationist period and against Austria in the late 18th century, fighting in the Bavarian War of Succession, where Saxony later mediated between the two major powers in Germany. But at the same time Prussia grew ever more in the role of our main enemy, as they became a danger to us, since they strenghthened their military. \n\nEver since the 1740s our relation worsened more and more, but as the French Revolution came and King Louis was deposed (and later executed), Prussia and Saxony agreed to fight on the side of the French King against the republicans. This alliance did exist until 1806, where Napoleon occupied Saxony and we defected to his side. Although we did fight reasonably well and did gain a lot of territory, it all came into unbeing, when Napoleon was defeated in 1815. \n\nAlthough we did lose half of our territory and population to Prussia in 1815, we still managed to keep our independence, as Prussia was hindered to annex us. Our relationship since 1815 was solid. As we are both part of the German Confederation and the Zollverein, we have to work together to bring Germany forward as a whole. In the revolutionary chaos of 1849, Prussia repelled the revolutionaries, since we were not capable to do that ourselves. \n\nSo, we have an ally turned into a enemy, with whom we had a troublesome relationship. How should we fare with Prussia?"
saxony.301.a:0 "Prussia is not our ally, and never will be."
SAX_PRS_relation_bad_effect_tt:0 "§RWe will pursue a path of opposition towards Prussia.§!"
saxony.301.b:0 "We need to reconciliate."
SAX_PRS_relation_good_effect_tt:0 "§GWe will pursue a path of rapprochement towards Prussia.§!"
saxony.302.t:0 "Austro-Saxon Relationship - Status Quo"
saxony.302.d:0 "Allies since the days of the old Holy Roman Empire, since the Habsburgs took over the title of the Holy Roman Emperor, the Electorate of Saxony and Austria maintained a solid relationship, up until the reformationist period. As our population converted to Lutherism, Austrians preferred to stay Catholic, which naturally caused tensions in the Empire. During the Thirty Years War, Saxony was first allied to the Austrians, but had to change sides later, as Swedes already occupied a huge chunk of Saxony. \n\nThe peace of Westphalia has brought Saxony some territory and ended the war with Austria. From there onwards, Saxony and Austria maintained a neutral, solid relationship, helping them when Vienna was surronded by the Turks in 1683, and fighting against the Turks in the following war. \n\nHaving had peace for 100 years, Saxony had to intervene in the Bavarian War of Succession, fighting against Austria, before mediating between Prussia and Austria. In the following Napoleonic Wars, Saxony fought on the side on Austria, until it joined Napoleon's 'Rheinbund' in 1806. After that Saxony fought against Austria, until Napoleon lost in 1813. Austria was the reason that we could stay independent after the Congress of Vienna, where Prussia wanted to annex us originally. \n\nWorking together in the German Confederation, Saxony and Austria have formed a friendly relationship and expressed their desire to cooperate, like in the 'Wiener Münzvertrag'. Austria is a important partner when it comes to our foreign policy, since we are assisted by them in military matters, especially against Prussia. \n\nOur relationship with Austria may have had low points before, but we have definetly formed a better relationship now. So, how do we want to approach Austria now, in these trying times?"
saxony.302.a:0 "We have a friendly relationship with Austria and will try to intensify it."
SAX_AUS_relation_good_effect_tt:0 "§YWe will pursue a path of amity towards Austria.§!"
saxony.302.b:0 "We need to be as impartial as possible."
SAX_AUS_relation_neutral_effect_tt:0 "§YWe will pursue a path of neutrality towards Austria.§!"
saxony.303.t:0 "[SAX.GetNameDef] Suggests Bundesreform Endeavor"
saxony.303.d:0 "The government of the [SAX.GetName] has announced its intention to reform the German Confederation. They are planning to shift some power of the federal governments to the German Bundestag in an attempt to give Germany's only central governing body more authority. The Saxons have presented their idea of opening up a united judicial branch for the German Confederation, which shall have authority in the entire Confederation. These ideas could increase centralization within the German Confederation, as many supporters of the national and liberal movement have suggested before. Should we support their idea?"
saxony.303.a:0 "Give them positive feedback."
SAX_bundesreform_event_positive_effect_tt:0 "This will encourage the Saxon government in their reform attempt."
saxony.303.b:0 "Tell them we are interested, but don't make any promises."
SAX_bundesreform_event_cautious_effect_tt:0 "This will inform the Saxon government that we need convicing."
saxony.303.c:0 "Let them know we are not interested."
SAX_bundesreform_event_negative_effect_tt:0 "This will notify the Saxon government that our cooperation is doubtful."
saxony.304.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Reacts Positively"

saxony.306.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has responded to our reform agenda."
saxony.306.a:0 "How sad!"
saxony.307.t:0 "Saxon Invitation to a Trias Conference in Würzburg"
saxony.307.d:0 "[SAX.GetNameDef] has invited us to a gathering of German middle states, the so-called Trias, in Würzburg. The Saxons have been very active diplomatically as of late, trying to build upon the mutual understanding of the smaller German powers at the Bamberg Conference in 1854. They maintain their assertion that the only way to preserve independence and peace for the German minors is to work together much more closely. How will we respond to their invitation?"
saxony.307.a:0 "We will join the conference."
saxony.307.b:0 "We will not join the conference."
saxony.308.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts Invitation"
saxony.308.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has accepted our invitation to the Würzburg Conference, where von Beust, our foreign minister, will present his plan to reform the German Confederation. This suggests that the [FROM.GetName] wants to assist us in our plan and that they do also oppose the current status quo!"
saxony.308.a:0 "Sehr gut!"
saxony.309.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Rejects Invitation"
saxony.309.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has rejected our invitation to be a participant of the Würzburg Conference, where von Beust, our foreign minister, will present his plan to reform the German Confederation. This just shows that the [FROM.GetName] does not want to take the next step and would rather like Germany to be split under Prussia's and Austria's boots!"

saxony.310.t:0 "Reform Debates Commence at the Würzburg Conference"
saxony.310.d:0 "The delegates of the German middle states who decided to dispatch diplomats for the discussion of a reform of the German Confederation have gathered in Würzburg, Bavaria. Our Bavarian hosts have prepared a well-known hotel in the city for the talks and also arranged for several social activities over the next four days, including a visit to the theater, a festive dinner at the mansion of the district president of Lower Franconia, Friedrich von Zu Rhein, and a ball."
saxony.310.a:0 "Ok, but don't forget the talks!"
saxony.311.t:0 "Würzburg Conference Comes to a Close"
saxony.311.d:0 "The Würzburg Conference has come to a close and our delegates are on their way back home. Although there haven't been any monumental breakthroughs in the discussions, we surely know much better where everyone stands now."
saxony.311.a:0 "It's been rather productive?"
SAX_first_wurzburg_conference_effect_tt:0 "§YWe will be able to convene another conference in a few months time.§!\n\n"
saxony.312.t:0 "Judiciary Reform Proposal Successful"
saxony.312.d:0 "The proposal for a judiciary reform of the German Confederation was passed by the Bundestag in Frankfurt. This is a very positive sign that our cooperation with the other middle states can bear fruit."
saxony.312.a:0 "Great news!"
saxony.313.t:0 "Judiciary Reform Proposal Fails"
saxony.313.d:0 "The proposal for a judiciary reform of the German Confederation has failed to secure a majority at the Bundestag in Frankfurt. Although this is certainly sad news, the cooperation of the German middle states prior to the debate in Frankfurt was promosing."
saxony.313.a:0 "Let's not bury our heads in the sand just yet."
saxony.314.t:0 "Promising Signs of Success"
saxony.314.d:0 "Our recent success in Frankfurt proves that we are on the right track, and it did certainly not go unnoticed by our potential partners for cooperation. We can surely build on this."

We would be Prussia's first target in case of war, as our roads are the fastest for reaching Prague and Vienna.

Some time after that, Christians that believed in Luthers ideas split up from the Catholic Church, and established their protestant one. As the formerly strongest protestant state we did everything to defend our religion, but since then, a long time passed.

During the revolutions of 1830 and 1848/49, this censorship proved to be very inadequate, only preventing people from officially expressing their opinions in newspapers, even if they could do so at meetings.

Allying with Prussia would also be good from our strategic point of view, as Austrian reinforcements would only arrive after we would have lost a majority of our territory against Prussia. Although we would definetly lose our claim to our former territory of northern Saxony, allying with Prussia could allow us to stay independent, whilst allying with Austria could mean the end of Saxony as a independent state.

By signing this agreement we would have a great chance that none of the great powers could invade us so easily, although our country forms the direct path of the Berlin-Prague-Vienna axis. Neither Prussia nor Austria could then probably risk attacking a country of the Trias alliance if there was a risk of then having to wage war against all members of the alliance.

Not only do they want to keep us independent, unlike Prussia did at several occasions, like in 1815, where they wished to outright annex us! But Austria is also a good partner for us for a long time and it is a bigger country than Prussia with a stronger army.

The construction of this rail line could help us in two ways: First, it will enable us or Saxon industry to import lignite from the North Bohemian Basin. The second reason for building a rail line is that it would make it easier for our partner Austria to defend us in a war, however unlikely, against Prussia."

SAX_focus_queen_mary_ironworks_desc:0 "Opened in 1839 in Cainsdorf near Zwickau, the Königin Marienhütte is one of the largest ironworks in Saxony. It is located near Zwickau because the main raw material, coal, which is processed there, is mined in the local coal mine. The products manufactured at Marienhütte, namely steel tracks and bridges, are used in our country to expand the rail network and infrastructure in general. A real gem of Saxon industry!"
SAX_focus_soften_bergregal:0 "Soften the Bergregal"
SAX_focus_soften_bergregal_desc:0 "The Bergregal is a act, that declares the nobility of a country the owner of the several mineral resourches in the country. Introduced during the days of the early Holy Roman Empire, it is still a law in Saxony, which may cause problems in our industrial development, since possible investors could be discouraged to invest. To prevent this, we shall go ahead and soften the Bergregal, to open up more investment opportunities for foreign investors, even if it means that the aristocracy has to give up their claims over Saxony's natural resources!"
SAX_focus_expand_mining_districts:0 "Expand Mining Districts"
SAX_focus_expand_mining_districts_desc:0 "Since we have softened the Bergregal, we can decide now where exactly mines should be established. Some politicians do think that it is the best idea to expand existing mining destricts and opening up new mines will help our economy and attract new investors."
SAX_focus_enact_berggesetz:0 "Enact Berggesetz"
SAX_focus_enact_berggesetz_desc:0 "Although we have softened the Bergregal, and the nobility has thus largely relinquished its claims while the mining sector is already open to investors, the Bergregal continues to exist on paper. We must officially abolish it and replace it with a genuine mining law, a Berggesetz, that officially allows investors to invest in the mining sector with legal certainty. Perhaps with this law we can also make the metallurgical industry independent."
SAX_focus_factory_industry:0 "Factory Industry"
SAX_focus_factory_industry_desc:0 "In 1854, the lawyer Karl Heine began to buy land in the municipality of Plagwitz, and began to develop the necessary infrastructure to be able to attract rich investors, in which he had some reasonable success. We should support Heine in his task, since we would also profit a lot from new investments and a stronger industry!"
SAX_focus_proto_industrialization:0 "Legacy of Proto-Industrialization"
SAX_focus_proto_industrialization_desc:0 "Before the process of industrialization fully started in Saxony, there were already some workers who worked in early factories, like the workers in the textile industry or specialized workers in mostly royal manufactories. Although factory-like work was already being done at that time, workers still had to do most of it by hand and had hardly any machines to support them. Some products of that time, like Saxon porcelain and glass, made our country famous beyond the borders of Germany, and we should make this prestige work for us."
SAX_focus_free_enterprise:0 "The Need for Free Enterprise"
SAX_focus_free_enterprise_desc:0 "We will have to adapt our legislation to attract investors, as we currently have laws that are too harsh and hinder the development of our economy. The introduction of freedom of enterprise could remove these barriers and further advance the industrialization process."
SAX_focus_textile_industry:0 "Saxon Textile Industry"
SAX_focus_textile_industry_desc:0 "Saxony has had a long history with the textile industry. Ever since the industrialisation began and Saxony became one of the most developed countries in Central Europe, multiple companies have opened factories in Saxony. But that is not the end - we have several other businessmen that are eager to open new factories in Saxony. We should support them, as we would profit of a stronger textile industry."
SAX_focus_saxon_manchester:0 "Chemnitz -\nThe Saxon Manchester"
SAX_focus_saxon_manchester_desc:0 "The heart of the industrialised Saxony lies in Chemnitz. Here, most of the companies and investors decide to open factories and produce textiles and the city has a great connection with the other Saxon and German regions. Like Manchester in England, Chemnitz is the industrial centre of our Saxony! But if we want to progressing we will need to expand our industrial branches, to not get dependent on our textile industry. We shall support the growth of the mechanical engineering industry."
SAX_focus_trade_and_commerce:0 "Trade & Commerce"
SAX_focus_trade_and_commerce_desc:0 "Saxony is not only a country that has a strong industry, in fact it is also a strong power in trading and in commerce. Due to our trade, from the 16th century onwards, we have managed to become a important economic partner and one of the economical centers in Europe. We should try to keep up that status, as our economy benefits massively from it!"
SAX_focus_allgemeine_creditanstalt:0 "Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt"
SAX_focus_allgemeine_creditanstalt_desc:0 "The 'Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt' was established in 1856 and is a Saxon bank. They are a symbol of Saxony's strength in the trade and finance sector and are a good partner, when it comes to investing. During their first year they have already managed to establish themselves in the German market and have announced their ambitious plans. They will surely be useful is we need a credit someday..."
SAX_focus_leipzig_book_fair:0 "Leipzig Book Fair"
SAX_focus_leipzig_book_fair_desc:0 "The Leipzig Book Fair has a long tradition in our country. First organised in the 17th century, it did grow from year to year, and is now the biggest book fair in the entirety of Germany, even bigger than the Frankfurt Book Fair, it's traditional rival organisation. Every year the world is being shown the Saxon and German culture, and we could use the fair to promote our own culture and trade in Saxony and in other countries."
SAX_focus_pelzhandelszentrum_leipzig:0 "Pelzhandelszentrum Leipziger Brühl"
SAX_focus_pelzhandelszentrum_leipzig_desc:0 "Our 'Pelzhandelszentrum' in Leipzig is a big part of Leipzig, and in turn, Saxony's economy. Being the biggest fur sale center, it became synonomous with fur sales itself. Its strength contributes to Saxony's economy and so it has to be obtained - by all means."
SAX_focus_saxon_bank_dresden:0 "Sächsische Bank zu Dresden"
SAX_focus_saxon_bank_dresden_desc:0 "A way to strenghten our economy and other parts of society is to open a bank, which is able to give various credits to companies and investors. Luckily for us, some businessman have expressed a interest in opening up such a bank. If we assist them with monetary concessions, we will be able to strengthen in fact our own economy and will have a bank that is connected to us."
SAX_focus_model_country:0 "Industrializing\nModel Country"
SAX_focus_model_country_desc:0 "Our already excellent position in the German industry and status as great industrial power was already secured. But still, reforms were necessary to keep that status. Our successful reforms have modernised Saxony and expanded it's industrial might - both in Germany and abroad. We are heading into a bright future with our unstoppable economy!"

SAX_idea_anti_prussian_sentiments_desc:0 "Just over 40 years ago, Prussia stripped away 60% of Saxon territory as a result of the Congress of Vienna. Prussia was barely stopped from annexing the entire nation, it is clear they have little regard for the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Saxony. The Napoleonic Wars brought Prussia back to the table of the European great powers, and their ambition to unite all German states is most threatening to Saxon independence."
SAX_idea_land_owners_prevalence_1:0 "Land Owners Prevalence"

SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_1:0 "Sorbian Tensions"
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_1_desc:0 "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. For centuries, Saxons have forcibly assimilated Sorbs through a destruction of Sorbian culture, literature, and language. Recently, the Sorbs have become more boisterous, thousands of them call for an end to the assimilation, and the tensions now risk boiling over."

SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_2_desc:0 "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. The Sorbian national culture is currently enjoying its heyday in poetry, music, literature, and language. Nevertheless, the way of mutual recognition will probably ease tensions and assist in their peaceful assimilation in the long run."

Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. The Sorbian national culture is currently enjoying its heyday in poetry, music, literature, and language. We must crash their separatist tendencies and force them to assimilate!"
SAX_idea_royal_society_for_sciences_1:0 "Royal Saxon Society for the Sciences"
SAX_idea_royal_society_for_sciences_1_desc:0 "With the support of the Royal Saxon Society for the Sciences, we could foster more scholars who, in turn, have the knowledge in their field to work in our industrial sector, for example, and perhaps revolutionize industry again. Highly qualified forces help us to move forward as a society, in all respects, not least in our industry."
SAX_idea_royal_society_for_sciences_2:0 "Royal Saxon Society for the Sciences and Leipzig University"
SAX_idea_royal_society_for_sciences_2_desc:0 "Through the support of the Royal Saxon Society for the Sciences and the Leipzig University, we can teach more students who are the future of Saxony.

The 'Berggesetz' seeks to de jure implement the changes that were de facto implemented a short time ago. It allows investors to invest in our land without them having to fear, that their land could be taken aback by the state after a new government rises to power."

#Country Leader Descriptions
SAX_FERDINAND_VON_ZSCHINSKY_LEADER_DESC:0 "Having studied and worked as a lawyer in the private, public, and aristocratic spheres, Ferdinand von Zschinsky served a two-week stint as the head of Saxony's Ministry of the Interior in 1848 before being appointed leader of the Saxon government by King Friedrich August II in 1849, an honour that eventually earned him an aristocratic title in 1856.\n\nZschinsky's leadership has been ideologically mixed: one of his government's first actions was the dissolution of the Saxon State Parliament and the reinstatement of the less liberal 1831 constitution (a major reversal of concessions made in the wake of the 1848 revolutions), but on the other hand he has also stripped feudal landlords of their legal jurisdiction and separated the powers of the state and judiciary.\n\nWhile his time in office has been consequential for Saxony, Ferdinand von Zschinsky is in ailing health, and he likely does not have much more time to lead."
