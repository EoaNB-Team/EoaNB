The recent Crimean War and Egyptian Revolt has caused considerable tribulation to the Ottoman rule, with many of its occupied lands beginning to resist Muslim rule. Though not everything has been dark and gloomy in the nation, Sultan Mahmud's II previous devotion to the Tanzimat Reforms has been continued and guided by Abdulmecid I in an attempt to better 'Ottomanize' the nation. A promising, yet delicate future can be seen ahead for the Sick Man of Europe, the house of cards centered in the eye of a thunderstorm."

 OTO_events.40.d: "In addition to Sofia, the earthquake was also felt in distant towns such as Plovdiv and Yanina. Buildings were affected in Ihtiman and Rila Monastery, and the flow of mineral springs changed in Dolna Banya. In Sofia, the earthquake caused significant damage, with 70-80% of buildings severely affected. The poorer inhabitants of the city are in a difficult situation, having to rebuild their houses unforeseen in the run-up to winter. Some have been helped by donations, such as that made by Ivan Denkoğlu.In the case of the larger public buildings, the damage was more severe, with some partially or completely destroyed. The minarets of 19 of the city's 24 mosques were demolished, and only 2 of the 7 churches remain usable. Among the destroyed buildings is the Siyavush Mosque, which was abandoned after the earthquake. According to eyewitness accounts, the roof of the minaret of the Bash Cheshme Mosque, toppled over and stuck its spire into the minaret's spire. One of the arches of the newly built St Nedelya Cathedral also fell. The earthquake kills 4 people, including two children at the Siyavush Mosque and one of the construction workers at St. Nedelya. In some places around Sofia cracks opened in the ground, according to Filaretov the crack between Boyana and Dragalevtsi is over 20 cm wide and about 1.5 km long. West of the city a new hot geyser appears, which gradually weakens to the still existing spring in Ovcha Kupel. The flow rate of the mineral springs in the town decreases for a few days and then recovers"
