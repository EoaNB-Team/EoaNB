###EVENTS
#Tanzimant Events
OTO_events.63.t: "Islahat Fermani"
OTO_events.63.d: "The Islahat Fermani is a reform edict from 1856. Better known as the 'Imperial Reform Edict', it is part of the so-called Tanzimat reforms were started by Sultan Mahmud II. His son and successor, Abdulmecid I, has decided to continue the reform path that his father has laid. He decided to announce this edict in order to streamline and combine the previous reform efforts into a larger picture. It is both a promise to his citizens and subjects as it is a sign towards the Western powers which supported the Ottomans in their struggle against Russia."
OTO_events.63.a: "Onwards to modernization!"
OTO_events.64.t: "Secure More Railway Funds"
OTO_events.64.d: "We need to secure more funds in order to fully develop our railways and infrastructure, otherwise we might get stuck before we can even get started. We have a few options on the international market but we need to make a decision who we should trust with this matter."
OTO_events.64.a: "Go with Prussian money, they only have economic interests here."
OTO_events.64.b: "Choose Austrian investors, we have a direct line to them."
OTO_events.64.c: "The French have helped us before, let's go with them."
OTO_events.65.t: "Meetings with Political Adversaries" 
OTO_events.65.d: "The Tanzimat reforms are met with stark resistance. We need to take action if we don't want to be at the wrong end of a stick eventually..."
OTO_events.65.d: "Let's ease off a bit."

#Military Reforms
OTO_events.66.t: "Potential Import Partners"
OTO_events.66.d: "It is clear that we cannot produce sufficient amounts of rifles on our own. We not only lack the appropriate facilities, building them up would also cost a lot of time and even more money. Thus, we are left with no other choice than to import weapons from abroad. The questions is, however, do we want to trust in this delicate matter?"
OTO_events.66.a: "Trust British suppliers."
OTO_events.66.b: "Trust the French instead, they will not betray us."
OTO_events.66.c: "Rely on American suppliers."
OTO_events.67.t: "A 300 Year Old Legacy…"
OTO_events.67.d: "The Ottoman artillery corps have a long and proud history, but at the same time a rather bleak and unfortunate present. Most, if not all our artillery pieces are outdated and fall short in comparison with any of our potential adversaries. 'Artillery is King of battle' as some military scholars said, so in order to compete with rival armies our artillery must be rearmed.\n\nProducing high-quality artillery weapons, however, requires time, skill and money. We seem to be lacking all of those requirements at the moment. It might, therefore, be wise to import artillery weapons from abroad. The Germans and Americans seem to be able to supply artillery weaponry of proven quality. Prussian Krupp cannons are considered cutting-edge, while American field artillery is also a solid choice.\n\nOn the other hand, it could be time to finally establish an artillery production of our own. It may be costly, time-consuming and is initially likely to be of lesser quality, but our supplies will be more secure and we could save money in the long run. So, what do we do?"
OTO_events.67.a: "Krupp cannons have proven their effectiveness."
OTO_events.67.b: "American artillery has been tested in the Civil War."
OTO_events.67.c: "There's nothing like homemade!"
OTO_events.68.t: "And What Of The Legacy Of Urbans?"
OTO_events.68.d: "WIP"
OTO_events.68.a: "WIP"
OTO_events.69.t: "A Strong Military - but at what Cost?"
OTO_events.69.d: "As any military campaign is largely financial, any military reform in the end results in question of the budget. We always need more arms, more arsenals, more officer academies and solider salaries. There is no possibility that the Porte can defeat another Great Power, namely Russia, without an even bigger budget for military spending. From another perspective, however, uncontrolled military spending could defeat our Empire faster than any Russian army ever could. We must consider our budgeting very carefully."
OTO_events.69.a: "The budget stays the same."
OTO_events.69.b: "Our army needs nore funds, increase the budget."
OTO_events.73.t: "The Donanma-yi Humâyûn"
OTO_events.73.d: "The Imperial Navy, or Donanma-yi Humâyûn as it is known in Ottoman Turkish, is considered to be pride of the High Porte, but it has lost its former glory in recent decades. The Mediterranean is now flooded with British and French ships, but our main contender still stands threatening in the Black Sea. Although we cannot compete with the Western navies, we could still be able to deter Russia in our northern waters, but that would require significant investments and many reforms to our naval organization, logistics and education."
OTO_events.73.a: "Lots of work ahead..."

#Balkan Tree
OTO_events.70.t: "The Copper Heart of the Empire"
OTO_events.70.d: "In 18th and 19th century Europe, wide-ranging reforms have been implemented in many areas following the Industrial Revolution. The need of resources has gradually increased with the development of industrialization at the start of this century. Our Empire, which followed all the developments closely and has recently begun the effort of modernization, has started to use and rediscover the rich mining basins within the country. The military and civilian industry sectors are much more vibrant now than they used to be in the 16th and 17th centuries. However, we are still lacking modern techniques for the extraction and transportation of sufficient amounts of goods compared to our European counterparts. Despite all of that, some parts of the Empire still manage to produce at least an adequate amount of the ores we need. This includes the Tokat copper mine in Asia Minor, which is a symbol of our ability to compete with the Western nations."
OTO_events.70.a: "We should invest into the copper mine at Tokat."
OTO_events.70.b: "Our money is better spent elsewhere."
OTO_events.71.t: "The Ruse-Varna Railway Project"
OTO_events.71.d: "In a bold move to modernize our Empire and enhance our strategic infrastructure, the Ottoman government needs to finalize plans for the Ruse-Varna Railway, connecting the Danube port city of Ruse with the Black Sea port of Varna. This project promises to revolutionize trade and military logistics within our borders. However, given the resources and expertise required, we have to decide whether we want to grant a concession to either British or French investors and engineers, or to rely on local experts to oversee the construction and initial operation of the railway. This decision has sparked considerable debate within the Empire. On one hand, foreign investment and expertise will expedite the project and ensure its success. On the other hand, commissioning to foreign companies would be more expensive and there are concerns about the extent of foreign influence and control over such a vital piece of infrastructure."
OTO_events.71.a: "Contact London."
OTO_events.71.b: "Use French capital."
OTO_events.71.c: "Trust in local experts."
OTO_events.72.t: "The First Railway in the Empire"
OTO_events.72.d: "As we strive to modernize the [OTO.GetName], the completion of the Ruse-Varna Railway in [GetYear] stands as a monumental achievement. Stretching from the Danube port city of Ruse to the Black Sea port of Varna, this railway is the first of its kind in our Empire, symbolizing our dedication to progress and innovation. This project not only enhances our trade routes but also fortifies our strategic military capabilities by streamlining the movement of troops and resources. This vital link between Europe and the Near East strengthens our ties with Western powers and showcases our commitment to modernization, promising a brighter future for our Empire."

Buildings were affected in Ihtiman and Rila Monastery, and the flow of mineral springs changed in Dolna Banya. In Sofia, the earthquake caused significant damage, with 70-80% of buildings severely affected. The poorer inhabitants of the city are in a difficult situation, having to rebuild their houses unforeseen in the run-up to winter. Some have been helped by donations, such as that made by Ivan Denkoğlu.In the case of the larger public buildings, the damage was more severe, with some partially or completely destroyed. The minarets of 19 of the city's 24 mosques were demolished, and only 2 of the 7 churches remain usable. Among the destroyed buildings is the Siyavush Mosque, which was abandoned after the earthquake. According to eyewitness accounts, the roof of the minaret of the Bash Cheshme Mosque, toppled over and stuck its spire into the minaret's spire. One of the arches of the newly built St Nedelya Cathedral also fell. The earthquake kills 4 people, including two children at the Siyavush Mosque and one of the construction workers at St. Nedelya. In some places around Sofia cracks opened in the ground, according to Filaretov the crack between Boyana and Dragalevtsi is over 20 cm wide and about 1.5 km long.

### Crete Revolt ###
####################
OTO_events.36.t: "The Mavrogenis Movement" 
OTO_events.36.d: "We have observed with growing concern the unrest brewing on the island of Crete, where certain elements, under the banner of the so-called Mavrogenis Movement, seek to disrupt the harmony of our rule. These agitators, fueled by anti-Ottoman sentiment and Greek nationalist ambitions, aim to destabilize the region and undermine the authority of the Sublime Porte. \n\nTheir rhetoric stirs rebellion among the local population, exploiting grievances and sowing discord. They invoke the name of Mavrogenis, a symbol of defiance, to rally support for their cause—a cause that threatens not only the peace of Crete but also the unity of our empire. These actions, however, do not escape our notice. We see their attempts to manipulate the hearts of the people, to poison them with notions of separation and revolt. \n\nOur response must be firm yet measured. The stability of Crete is paramount, not only for the island’s prosperity but for the greater security of the empire. The just laws of the Sultan protect all who live under our banner, and we will not allow a handful of agitators to disrupt this balance. Let it be known to all that the strength of the Ottoman Empire cannot be shaken by whispered conspiracies or reckless provocations. \n\nThrough vigilance and decisive governance, we shall quash the ambitions of these movements, ensuring that Crete remains a loyal and integral part of the empire. Let the agitators take heed: the Sublime Porte does not waver in the face of disloyalty."
OTO_events.36.a: "Worrisome."

OTO_events.37.t: "The Greek Revolt" 
OTO_events.37.d: "We are faced with yet another disturbance in Crete, where Greek agitators, emboldened by their dreams of independence and driven by foreign influences, have ignited rebellion against the authority of the Sublime Porte. This so-called Greek Revolt of 1858 is but the latest manifestation of the unrest fomented by those who refuse to accept the peace and stability that Ottoman rule provides. \n\nThese rebels, drawing upon the misguided fervor of their compatriots, have turned to violence and disruption. They seek to fracture the unity of the empire, spreading chaos across the island and inflaming tensions among the populace. Their actions are an affront to the benevolent governance extended to all subjects of the Sultan, regardless of creed or origin. \n\nThe Sublime Porte will not tolerate such betrayal. The revolt will be met with the resolve and strength that have safeguarded our lands for centuries. Loyal forces are already moving to restore order, while wise and fair policies will address the grievances that these agitators claim to champion. Let them see that the might of the Ottoman Empire is unyielding, and that treachery serves only to deepen their misery. \n\nThis revolt is not merely a challenge to our authority—it is a test of our unity. As we extinguish the fires of rebellion, we reaffirm the strength of the empire and the enduring bond between the Sultan and his people. Crete shall remain under the banner of the crescent, and the whispers of sedition will fade, as they always have, before the steadfast will of the Sublime Porte."
OTO_events.37.a: "That's not how we planned it!"

OTO_events.38.t: "The Rebels are stopped" 
OTO_events.38.d: "The rebellion in Crete has been quelled. The misguided agitators who sought to challenge the authority of the Sublime Porte have been met with decisive action, and their uprising has been brought to an end. Order has been restored across the island, and the banners of rebellion have been replaced by the enduring strength of Ottoman governance.\n\nThese rebels, who allowed themselves to be swayed by empty promises of foreign support and the delusions of separatism, now find their efforts in ruins. Their leaders have been apprehended or scattered, their cause discredited in the eyes of those who once lent them ear. The people of Crete, witnessing the swift and resolute measures taken, now understand the futility of opposing the just rule of the Sultan. \n\nThis victory reaffirms the unity and stability of the Ottoman Empire. The Sublime Porte has shown, once again, that it will not waver in the face of defiance. With fairness and wisdom, measures will be implemented to ensure lasting peace on the island, addressing grievances while safeguarding the empire’s sovereignty. \n\n Let this serve as a reminder to all who might seek to stir unrest: the resolve of the Sultan and the might of the empire stand firm. Crete remains an inseparable part of the Ottoman domain, and its people are under the protection of the crescent, now and always."

The celebration was more than an honoring of saints—it was an affirmation of language, unity, and the hope of preserving their heritage.

It drew men and women from across Varna, each one understanding the significance of this milestone. Here, at last, was a Bulgarian-led church where they could honor their faith without compromise.

Tired of Greek clergy who held authority over their religious institutions and suppressed the use of the Bulgarian language in worship, the people of Silistra gathered with a united purpose—to reclaim their spiritual independence.\n This act was more than a rejection of foreign authority; it was an assertion of Bulgarian identity and pride. By renouncing Greek oversight, they declared their right to worship in their own language and to choose clergy who understood their culture and values. The people of Silistra, once constrained by this foreign rule, now moved toward a future that honored their heritage, marking a powerful step in the broader Bulgarian struggle for cultural and religious autonomy."

This shift was nurtured by local teachers, clergy, and community leaders, who introduced ideas of cultural pride, self-determination, and the importance of preserving Bulgarian traditions.\nThrough gatherings in modest homes and churches, and with the establishment of Bulgarian-language schools, the people of Vratsa found new ways to connect with their roots. Simple acts, like teaching children in Bulgarian or organizing small celebrations of national holidays, played an essential role in unifying the community. This quiet awakening brought the people of Vratsa closer together, fostering a deep sense of belonging and the courage to envision a future where their language and customs were honored.

This church, dedicated to the revered Emperor Constantine and his mother, Helena, quickly became a center for the Bulgarian faithful who sought a space of their own to worship and gather in their native language.\nThe establishment of the church was a hard-won victory, achieved through the persistent efforts of local Bulgarians who had long yearned for an independent spiritual home, free from foreign influence. For the community, this church was more than a place of prayer—it was a testament to their resilience and unity, a symbol of their desire to preserve their cultural identity within the Ottoman Empire. As they celebrated the opening, the Bulgarians of Odrin embraced the Church of St. Constantine and Helena as a beacon of faith and a foundation for their future, rooted in their language, customs, and beliefs.

OTO_events.212.t: "The Phanariots in Skopie exile the local Bulgarian leader"
OTO_events.212.d: "In Skopje, tensions peaked as the influential Phanariots—Greek clerics and administrators loyal to the Constantinople Patriarchate—ordered the exile of the respected local Bulgarian leader, Jordan Hadzhikonstantinov-Dzhinot. Known as a passionate advocate for Bulgarian culture, language, and education, Dzhinot had become a prominent figure in the community, inspiring many to embrace their Bulgarian identity amidst Greek ecclesiastical dominance.\nDzhinot's commitment to teaching and promoting the Bulgarian language in schools and churches made him a powerful symbol of resistance to Hellenization efforts by the Phanariots, who sought to maintain control over the region's religious and cultural life. His influence unsettled the Greek clergy, who viewed his work as a threat to their authority. In a decisive move, they exiled him from Skopje, hoping to curb his impact and weaken the Bulgarian movement.\nHowever, Dzhinot's exile only fueled the resolve of his supporters, and his legacy continued to inspire the local population. His forced departure became a rallying point, solidifying the community's determination to preserve their heritage despite opposition"

OTO_events.213.d: "We were informed that American travelers made their way to Skopje with a distinct mission: to spread Protestant ideas among the local population. Drawn by a commitment to religious outreach, these travelers introduced new perspectives on faith, aiming to share Protestant beliefs in a region traditionally rooted in Orthodox Christianity.\nTheir presence in Skopje was both novel and met with mixed reactions. While some locals showed curiosity towards the teachings and educational materials brought by the Americans, others viewed these efforts with skepticism, wary of foreign influence on their longstanding religious traditions. The Americans, often distributing translated Bibles and offering literacy classes, sought to engage the community on a grassroots level, emphasizing personal faith and spiritual renewal.\nAlthough the impact of Protestantism remains limited in Orthodox-stronghold Skopje, the efforts of these American travelers added a new chapter to the city's religious life, sparking conversations about faith and subtly influencing local perspectives on education, literacy, and personal belief."

OTO_events.214.t: "Bulgarians in Bitolya take over control of the local church"
OTO_events.214.d: "In Bitolya, a turning point arrived when the local Bulgarian community took control of the church Saint Nedelya, reclaiming it from Greek clerical authority. For years, the Greek-dominated Patriarchate had overseen religious life in the region, conducting services in Greek and imposing practices that felt foreign to the Bulgarian parishioners. However, as Bulgarian national consciousness grew, so did the desire for a church that reflected their language, traditions, and identity.\nThe takeover of the church was a peaceful yet determined act, orchestrated by local leaders and supported by the wider community. With this step, Bulgarians in Bitolya could now hold services in their own language and appoint clergy who represented their beliefs and cultural background. This achievement was not only a spiritual milestone but also a powerful assertion of independence, resonating across the region as a symbol of the Bulgarian movement for religious and cultural self-determination."

Both passionate about preserving Bulgarian identity in the face of Greek ecclesiastical and cultural dominance, they worked tirelessly to spread awareness among the townspeople. Through speeches, gatherings, and informal discussions, Mishaikov and Robev highlighted the need for a Bulgarian-led church and schools where their language and traditions could thrive.\nTheir efforts stirred a sense of unity and purpose within the community, encouraging people to resist the influence of Greek authorities and to reclaim their cultural heritage. By shedding light on what they saw as efforts to suppress Bulgarian customs and language, Mishaikov and Robev strengthened the movement for independence and self-determination. Their activism left a lasting impact on Bitolya, further fueling the Bulgarian national awakening and setting the stage for greater efforts toward autonomy in the region."

In a striking display, a Russian flag is raised in the city's center—a banner of defiance, loyalty, and rising tensions. Bulgarians, raising the Russian flag at the heart of the city, make their allegiances uncomfortably clear, rallying in a fervor that hints at Russian sway and Slavic defiance against our rightful order. Their chants, their emboldened gestures, stir discord within our territories, fueling a dream of independence they seek to stoke with the help of Russia.

Seeking to celebrate the service in Bulgarian rather than Greek, Bulgarian worshippers pushed for representation of their language, symbolizing a deeper struggle for national identity and autonomy within the Ottoman Empire. Greek adherents resisted, seeing the use of Greek as essential to Orthodox unity, and the resulting clash spilled into the streets.

As the Bulgarian faithful sought to replace Greek priests with those who would serve in their native language, the service became a symbol of growing national pride and defiance against Greek-dominated ecclesiastical rule.

For centuries, Greek clergy had wielded influence over Bulgarian parishes, asserting control over liturgy and religious practices, often suppressing Bulgarian language and customs in favor of Greek. But as national consciousness awakened among Bulgarians, so did the desire for a church that truly represented them. Led by local leaders and the powerful voice of the guilds, the Bulgarian congregation in Plovdiv boldly refused to accept Greek priests appointed by the Constantinople Patriarchate. They demanded that services be conducted in Bulgarian, asserting their right to worship in their own language and under clergy of their choosing. This act of defiance was more than religious dissent; it was a declaration of cultural independence, a stand against assimilation."

OTO_events.225.d: "In the town of Ruse, local Bulgarian leaders have recently formed their own municipal council, taking over matters that were once under our direct oversight. With this new body, they have assumed partial control over key civic responsibilities, including the regulation of taxes, the management of schools, and the administration of church affairs.\nThis council, although small, has been established with a clear aim of consolidating Bulgarian interests and reducing Ottoman influence over their community. Through it, they have sought to direct their own resources and foster their language and customs within the schools and churches, rather than adhering to the structures we have long maintained. While their efforts may seem modest, this development represents a shift in authority that, if left unchecked, could encourage further autonomy among Bulgarians in other regions.\nThe Ottoman administration must remain vigilant regarding these emerging forms of local governance. Although Ruse may be but one town, it serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining unity and order throughout our territories. We must continue to guide these communities, ensuring that our laws and influence remain intact in every corner of the Empire."

OTO_events.226.d: "The unrest among the Bulgarians in Constantinople has grown unmistakable. Their voices, filled with resentment toward the Greek Patriarchate, echo through our streets, demanding independence in religious matters and the right to their own schools and clergy. They see Greek authority as an unwanted yoke, and each protest only fans the flames of this burgeoning nationalism.\nThese Bulgarians claim their own identity and heritage, seeking to shake off Greek dominance within the Orthodox Church, where the Patriarchate has long held sway over all Orthodox subjects. They insist on a Bulgarian church, a Bulgarian future, free from the Greek influence they believe marginalizes them. This demand for independence, however, is a dangerous crack in the unity of our diverse subjects. The Greek community, strong and rooted in this city, regards this as a threat to their own standing and rights.\nIt falls to us to maintain the Empire's fragile balance—to prevent this struggle between Bulgarians and Greeks from igniting outright conflict. Constantinople has weathered countless storms, but this rising tension between our subjects suggests a deeper shift—a sense that perhaps the loyalties we rely on are loosening, even here, in the center of our rule."

OTO_events.227.t: "A proposal from Sofronii on the Bulgarian Church Matter"
OTO_events.227.d: "Ah, yes—Sofronii, the esteemed head of the Patriarchate. His proposal regarding the Bulgarian church matter carries a different weight, one deeply intertwined with the Greek Orthodox establishment. As the patriarch, Sofronii has long been a key figure in maintaining the Church's authority over all Orthodox subjects under the Empire, including the Bulgarians. However, in his recent proposal, he suggests a delicate approach to appease the growing nationalist sentiment among the Bulgarians while still preserving the Patriarchate's influence.\nSofronii, aware of the rising tide of Bulgarian calls for autonomy, proposes a series of reforms within the Patriarchate itself. He suggests granting the Bulgarians greater representation in the Church's hierarchy, such as allowing them to elect bishops and establish their own eparchies under the oversight of the Patriarchate. This would, in theory, provide a compromise—offering Bulgarians a sense of ownership and agency over their religious affairs without fully severing ties with Greek leadership.\nThe proposal is a recognition that the growing Bulgarian desire for independence cannot be ignored. However, it remains firmly rooted in the belief that the Patriarchate must retain its overarching authority. Sofronii's message is clear: the Bulgarians must be granted more autonomy, but not at the expense of the unity of the Orthodox Church under Greek leadership.\nFor the Ottoman authorities, this proposal offers a delicate solution—one that seeks to avoid further unrest by offering the Bulgarians a degree of satisfaction while keeping the Greek Church firmly in control. Yet, it is unlikely to fully satisfy either side. The Bulgarians will see it as a half-measure, and the Greeks may fear that any concession is a step toward further fragmentation. As ever, the balance we must maintain grows ever more precarious."

OTO_events.228.d: "In 1867, Sultan Abdul Aziz made a rare visit to the town of Ruse, an event that carried profound significance both for the Ottoman Empire and its subjects in the Balkans. Ruse, situated along the Danube River, had long been a vital gateway between the Empire and Europe, yet the visit marked a crucial moment of imperial authority and personal engagement with the local population.\nThe Sultan's presence in Ruse was not just a ceremonial affair; it was an assertion of Ottoman strength and unity at a time when nationalist movements were gaining momentum among the various ethnicities in the Empire. The Bulgarians, in particular, were growing restless, their demands for religious and cultural autonomy intensifying. In this context, Abdul Aziz's visit symbolized the Empire's ongoing hold over its territories, despite the increasing pressure from nationalist forces seeking to fracture the unity of the Ottoman state.\nFor the local populace, the visit was a mixture of awe and anxiety. The Sultan's entourage, grand and imposing, conveyed the might of the Empire, while his words and gestures were carefully crafted to reassure both the Bulgarian and Turkish communities of his commitment to their well-being under Ottoman rule. In the face of growing Bulgarian unrest, Abdul Aziz's visit could be seen as an attempt to reassert imperial control and forestall any further challenges to Ottoman governance."

OTO_events.229.d: "The Ottoman government has become aware of recent developments concerning the establishment of a separate ecclesiastical oblast, or administrative district, by certain factions within the Ohrid region. This move, which appears to be an attempt to create an independent religious authority distinct from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, has come to the attention of the Imperial authorities.\nWhile the Ottoman Empire has consistently supported religious freedom and the autonomy of its subjects in practicing their faith, it is imperative to remember that the religious governance of the Christian communities, including those in Ohrid, has long been under the recognized jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which operates in full alignment with the Empire's laws. The establishment of a separate ecclesiastical district in Ohrid—one that seeks to sever ties with the Patriarchate—is not in accordance with the established order and cannot be recognized by the Imperial government.\nThe Ohrid region, with its rich history and established connection to the Patriarchate, has been part of the broader Orthodox Christian community under the Ottoman Empire. The proposal to create a new ecclesiastical oblast in Ohrid represents a direct challenge to the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and, by extension, to the unity and stability of the Empire itself. Such actions, though purported to be religious in nature, carry significant political implications, as they can sow division among the various Christian communities under Ottoman protection."

This decision, made without the consent of the central religious authorities or the approval of the Ottoman state, constitutes a direct challenge to the established ecclesiastical order and cannot be tolerated under the laws of the Empire.\nThe Ottoman Empire has long recognized the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarchate over its Orthodox Christian communities, including those in Nevrokop. The Patriarchate has served as the spiritual guide for these communities, maintaining peace and unity within the Empire. Any attempts to sever these ties disrupt the religious and social harmony that has been carefully cultivated over centuries, and such actions undermine the stability of the Ottoman state. As subjects of the Empire, the people of Nevrokop are bound by the laws that govern religious and civil matters, which include adherence to the authority of the Patriarchate.\nThe Ottoman Government urges those involved in this breakaway movement to reconsider their actions and return to the established religious structures.

Instead, they turn to the western christianity. This move not only disrupts the influence of the Patriarchate in the region but also serves as an inspiration to other Bulgarian communities seeking to reclaim their ecclesiastical autonomy. The separation is a direct challenge to both the Greek clergy and Ottoman officials, who had relied on the Patriarchate to maintain order among the Orthodox population. Now, a new precedent is set, sparking regional unease and raising questions about broader loyalty shifts among the Empire's Bulgarian subjects. For the Ottomans, this is not merely a religious matter; it hints at rising nationalist fervor that could ripple far beyond Kukush. Now, the Kukush region has become part of the Roman Church."

For four centuries, since they fell under Ottoman rule at the end of the 14th Century, most Bulgarians had not minded this. In the mid-19th Century, however, Bulgarian intellectuals and some of the rich merchants increasingly began to realise that the domination of the Greek bishops was against their interests, not least because the services were held in Greek and few of the worshippers could understand them. The tension between Bulgarians and Greeks finally came to a head today, April 3rd. During the Easter service at the Bulgarian St Stephen's Church in Constantinople, the priest, Ilarion Makariopolski, did not pray for his superior, the Greek patriarch, as he was supposed to do.

This bishop sought to replace Bulgarian language and customs in their churches with Greek, a move the local artisans saw as a threat to their identity.\nTo the Bulgarian esnafs of Prilep, the bishop's presence was an affront not only to their faith but to their very identity. With his insistence on conducting liturgy in Greek and discouraging the use of Bulgarian in churches and schools, he was seen not as a shepherd but as a foreign usurper. The people of Prilep spoke Bulgarian in the marketplace, sang in Bulgarian during weddings, mourned in Bulgarian at gravesides.

For centuries, the Patriarchate has been the guiding hand for all Orthodox Christians within our borders, but now the Bulgarians have declared their own ecclesiastical path, one that answers not to the Greeks, but to their own growing national spirit.\nThis rupture strikes at the heart of Constantinople's delicate balance. The Patriarchate has long been a central pillar of our Empire's control over the Orthodox millet, yet the Bulgarians now reject this authority, fueled by a fierce determination to affirm their distinct identity. They view the Greek clergy as oppressors, holding back their language, their schools, their very right to self-definition. Their aim is clear: they seek a church and a future that serve Bulgarians alone, free from Greek oversight.\nThe Greeks, naturally, are incensed by this bold challenge. Tensions simmer as both communities question their place in an empire that was built on unity despite differences. To us, this fracture is not simply a matter of faith—it is a test of our governance.

This demand is more than a religious matter; it is a declaration of independence and self-determination, a bold stand for their place within the Ottoman Empire.

This council is a statement—a direct challenge to the authority of the Greek Patriarchate and a demonstration of the Bulgarians' desire to govern their religious life independently.\nIn Varna, they have gathered their clergy, intellectuals, and leaders, openly discussing how to secure a future free from the Greek-dominated Patriarchate. They no longer wish to answer to Greek bishops who, in their view, overlook or stifle Bulgarian language, customs, and education. Through this council, the Bulgarians seek to build a church that reflects their own identity and national pride, unclouded by what they see as foreign influence.\nThe Greeks, as expected, perceive this council as an act of defiance, an unsettling signal of the Bulgarians' growing resolve. Our administration must be vigilant, as this move in Varna could ignite further unrest across other regions where Bulgarians seek to emulate this example. The very structure of the Orthodox millet is being tested; even in Constantinople, the echoes of this council can be felt, casting doubt over the stability of our traditional order.

This gathering, though framed as a call for religious autonomy, stands as a clear and direct challenge to the established order and authority of the Ottoman Empire, particularly the sacred authority vested in the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.\nThe assembled group claims to have sought an independent Bulgarian Church, separate from the jurisdiction of the Greek Patriarchate. It is important to recognize that the Greek Orthodox Church, under the Patriarchate, has long served as an integral pillar of religious and spiritual life for the Orthodox Christian communities within the empire, including the Bulgarians. The Patriarchate has maintained its duties with full adherence to the Empire's laws and the principles of unity and peace.\nWe acknowledge that there have been tensions between certain Bulgarian factions and the Patriarchate, driven by political and cultural motivations. However, the Ottoman Empire has long upheld the principle of religious freedom, respecting the rights of all subjects, including Bulgarians, to practice their faith according to their traditions. The claims made in the Solyn assembly, which seek to undermine the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, cannot be tolerated, as they threaten not only religious unity but the peace of the Ottoman realm.\nLet it be clear that the assembly held in Solyn is not recognized by the Imperial Government, nor does it hold any legal or ecclesiastical standing within the context of Ottoman law. The movement for an independent Bulgarian Church is not only an affront to the established religious order but also risks inciting division among the Ottoman Christian subjects.

OTO_events.243.d: "In 1860, American missionaries established a Protestant school in Plovdiv, bringing Western educational ideals to Bulgaria amidst rising national and cultural consciousness. This institution aims to provide a modern education with a focus on literacy and scientific studies, contrasting with traditional church-based schooling. As a result, it contributed not only to educational reform but also to the convertion to Protestantism that was distinct from both Greek and Ottoman."
OTO_events.243.a: "Protestants?!?!"

OTO_events.244.t: "Skopie files petition against us"
OTO_events.244.d: "The Imperial Government has received and carefully considered the recent petitions filed by the representatives of the city of Skopje. These petitions, which express concerns and grievances regarding the authority of the Ottoman state and the administration of religious matters, must be addressed with due regard to both the legal frameworks of the Empire and the historical agreements that have maintained the peace and stability of the realm.\nIt is important to remind the petitioners in Skopje that the Ottoman Empire has long maintained a policy of religious tolerance and autonomy for its Christian subjects, while ensuring the stability and unity of its diverse territories. The central authority of the Empire, particularly in religious matters, has been exercised through the established and recognized institutions, including the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople, which has been granted responsibility for overseeing the spiritual needs of the Orthodox Christian communities in all regions under Ottoman protection, including Skopje.\nThe petitions from Skopje, which seek to challenge or undermine this authority, represent a serious and unwarranted departure from the established norms. These petitions, which may reflect the aspirations of a small faction within the city, cannot be accepted as legitimate claims against the Ottoman government or its religious institutions. The unity of the Empire, both politically and religiously, is paramount, and any attempts to disrupt this unity through divisive actions will not be tolerated."
OTO_events.244.a: "Skopie has fallen..."

OTO_events.245.t: "Formation of the Bulgarian Exarchate"
OTO_events.245.d: "The Ottoman Government, in light of growing religious and national aspirations among the Bulgarian Orthodox Christian community, acknowledges the pressing need for a reorganization of ecclesiastical governance within the Empire. After careful consideration and in response to widespread calls for greater religious autonomy, we propose the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate, a separate ecclesiastical authority that will serve the Bulgarian Orthodox faithful within the Empire, while still maintaining the overall unity of the Ottoman state.\nThe formation of the Bulgarian Exarchate is intended to address the legitimate religious needs and national consciousness of the Bulgarian people, who have long sought a more direct connection with their spiritual leaders, distinct from the influence of the Greek-dominated Patriarchate of Constantinople. This proposed Exarchate will remain under the protection of the Ottoman Empire, ensuring that it does not threaten the stability of the Empire or the cohesion of its Christian communities, but rather aims to foster greater religious harmony and unity among the diverse peoples under our rule.\nIn creating the Bulgarian Exarchate, the Ottoman Government aims to strike a balance between granting religious autonomy to the Bulgarian Orthodox Christians while upholding the Empire's longstanding commitment to the rights of its subjects and the preservation of unity. The Exarchate will function within the legal framework of the Empire, and the government will ensure that its formation does not lead to division or unrest. This proposal seeks to acknowledge the religious needs of the Bulgarian people, strengthen their ties to the Empire, and preserve the peace and stability of the region."

OTO_events.246.t: "Plesbicite in Macedonian Dioceses"
OTO_events.246.d: "In 1874, a significant plebiscite took place in the Macedonian dioceses, offering local Bulgarians the opportunity to decide whether they would join the newly established Bulgarian Exarchate or remain under the jurisdiction of the Greek-dominated Constantinople Patriarchate. This vote was a defining moment for the region, reflecting a widespread desire among Bulgarians for ecclesiastical independence and national self-determination.\nThe plebiscite was driven by the aspirations of the Bulgarian population to conduct religious services in their own language and to support clergy who represented their cultural identity. The process stirred considerable enthusiasm and debate, as communities came together to discuss the future of their religious institutions and cultural autonomy. In the end, the majority chose to align with the Bulgarian Exarchate, a choice that deepened the growing sense of Bulgarian identity across the region and reinforced the movement for national awakening.\nWhile this plebiscite was a peaceful democratic act, it also underscored the existing tensions in the Ottoman Empire, as communities increasingly sought to define their own paths amidst a shifting political and cultural landscape."
OTO_events.246.a: "We lost macedonia as well"
OTO_events.246.b: "We won't allow this"

OTO_events.247.t: "The Greek Patriarchate Exommunicates the Bulgarian Exarchate"
OTO_events.247.d: "In a dramatic turn of events, the Greek-dominated Ecumenical Patriarchate issued a sweeping excommunication of the newly formed Bulgarian Exarchate. This action followed the Bulgarian church's bold move to declare independence, establishing their own exarchate with the aim of preserving Bulgarian language, traditions, and governance within their church. The Greek Patriarchate, viewing this separation as both heretical and politically defiant, issued a formal decree severing spiritual ties with the Bulgarian faithful who followed the Exarchate.\nFor Bulgarians, the excommunication was not merely a religious punishment; it was a powerful symbol of the struggle for national identity. While the Greek clergy sought to reinforce the authority of the Patriarchate, the excommunication only fueled the Bulgarians' determination to maintain a church that was truly theirs. This act by the Patriarchate marked a painful yet defining chapter in Bulgarian history, igniting broader support for the exarchate and deepening the Bulgarians' resolve to protect their cultural and religious autonomy within the Ottoman Empire."

### Bulgarian Chruch mechanic ###
OTO_bulgarian_church: "[?BUL.GetFlag]The Bulgarian Church Question"
OTO_church_desc: "In the 19th century, the Bulgarian people longed for both national and religious independence, as the §LOrthodox Church§! in Bulgaria was tightly controlled by the Greek-dominated Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople. This control extended over Bulgarian clergy appointments and church language, eroding the Bulgarian cultural identity and fostering resentment among the population.The historical regions of Bulgaria are divided between Moesia, Dobrudja, Thrace and Macedonia. Each region has its own towns and settlements where Bulgarian culture thrive. In the dawn of Bulgarian Nationalism a big part of the towns in Bulgaria became more and more reluctant to the Greek church in Constantinople. If our stability §tfalls§! too much a wave of §Rseparatism§! will rise, which may lead to a schism in the church. The Nation Breakdown axis shows the confrontation between the pro-western Catholic §0Uniates§! and the pro-Russian Orthodox §7'The Young'§!.\nIf you want to see the §Rseparatism§! values for each state you'll need to §Yhover over them!§!"
