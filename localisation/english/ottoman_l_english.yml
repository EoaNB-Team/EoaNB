###EVENTS
#Tanzimant Events
OTO_events.63.t: "Islahat Fermani"
OTO_events.63.d: "The Islahat Fermani is a reform edict from 1856. Better known as the 'Imperial Reform Edict', it is part of the so-called Tanzimat reforms were started by Sultan Mahmud II. His son and successor, Abdulmecid I, has decided to continue the reform path that his father has laid. He decided to announce this edict in order to streamline and combine the previous reform efforts into a larger picture. It is both a promise to his citizens and subjects as it is a sign towards the Western powers which supported the Ottomans in their struggle against Russia."
OTO_events.63.a: "Onwards to modernization!"
OTO_events.64.t: "Secure More Railway Funds"
OTO_events.64.d: "We need to secure more funds in order to fully develop our railways and infrastructure, otherwise we might get stuck before we can even get started. We have a few options on the international market but we need to make a decision who we should trust with this matter."
OTO_events.64.a: "Go with Prussian money, they only have economic interests here."
OTO_events.64.b: "Choose Austrian investors, we have a direct line to them."
OTO_events.64.c: "The French have helped us before, let's go with them."
OTO_events.65.t: "Meetings with Political Adversaries" 
OTO_events.65.d: "The Tanzimat reforms are met with stark resistance. We need to take action if we don't want to be at the wrong end of a stick eventually..."
OTO_events.65.d: "Let's ease off a bit."

#Military Reforms
OTO_events.66.t: "Potential Import Partners"
OTO_events.66.d: "It is clear that we cannot produce sufficient amounts of rifles on our own. We not only lack the appropriate facilities, building them up would also cost a lot of time and even more money. Thus, we are left with no other choice than to import weapons from abroad. The questions is, however, do we want to trust in this delicate matter?"
OTO_events.66.a: "Trust British suppliers."
OTO_events.66.b: "Trust the French instead, they will not betray us."
OTO_events.66.c: "Rely on American suppliers."
OTO_events.67.t: "A 300 Year Old Legacy…"
OTO_events.67.d: "The Ottoman artillery corps have a long and proud history, but at the same time a rather bleak and unfortunate present. Most, if not all our artillery pieces are outdated and fall short in comparison with any of our potential adversaries. 'Artillery is King of battle' as some military scholars said, so in order to compete with rival armies our artillery must be rearmed.\n\nProducing high-quality artillery weapons, however, requires time, skill and money. We seem to be lacking all of those requirements at the moment. It might, therefore, be wise to import artillery weapons from abroad. The Germans and Americans seem to be able to supply artillery weaponry of proven quality. Prussian Krupp cannons are considered cutting-edge, while American field artillery is also a solid choice.\n\nOn the other hand, it could be time to finally establish an artillery production of our own. It may be costly, time-consuming and is initially likely to be of lesser quality, but our supplies will be more secure and we could save money in the long run. So, what do we do?"
OTO_events.67.a: "Krupp cannons have proven their effectiveness."
OTO_events.67.b: "American artillery has been tested in the Civil War."
OTO_events.67.c: "There's nothing like homemade!"
OTO_events.68.t: "And What Of The Legacy Of Urbans?"
OTO_events.68.d: "WIP"
OTO_events.68.a: "WIP"
OTO_events.69.t: "A Strong Military - but at what Cost?"
OTO_events.69.d: "As any military campaign is largely financial, any military reform in the end results in question of the budget. We always need more arms, more arsenals, more officer academies and solider salaries. There is no possibility that the Porte can defeat another Great Power, namely Russia, without an even bigger budget for military spending. From another perspective, however, uncontrolled military spending could defeat our Empire faster than any Russian army ever could. We must consider our budgeting very carefully."
OTO_events.69.a: "The budget stays the same."
OTO_events.69.b: "Our army needs nore funds, increase the budget."
OTO_events.73.t: "The Donanma-yi Humâyûn"
OTO_events.73.d: "The Imperial Navy, or Donanma-yi Humâyûn as it is known in Ottoman Turkish, is considered to be pride of the High Porte, but it has lost its former glory in recent decades. The Mediterranean is now flooded with British and French ships, but our main contender still stands threatening in the Black Sea. Although we cannot compete with the Western navies, we could still be able to deter Russia in our northern waters, but that would require significant investments and many reforms to our naval organization, logistics and education."
OTO_events.73.a: "Lots of work ahead..."

#Balkan Tree
OTO_events.70.t: "The Copper Heart of the Empire"
OTO_events.70.d: "In 18th and 19th century Europe, wide-ranging reforms have been implemented in many areas following the Industrial Revolution. The need of resources has gradually increased with the development of industrialization at the start of this century. Our Empire, which followed all the developments closely and has recently begun the effort of modernization, has started to use and rediscover the rich mining basins within the country. The military and civilian industry sectors are much more vibrant now than they used to be in the 16th and 17th centuries. However, we are still lacking modern techniques for the extraction and transportation of sufficient amounts of goods compared to our European counterparts. Despite all of that, some parts of the Empire still manage to produce at least an adequate amount of the ores we need. This includes the Tokat copper mine in Asia Minor, which is a symbol of our ability to compete with the Western nations."
OTO_events.70.a: "We should invest into the copper mine at Tokat."
OTO_events.70.b: "Our money is better spent elsewhere."
OTO_events.71.t: "The Ruse-Varna Railway Project"
OTO_events.71.d: "In a bold move to modernize our Empire and enhance our strategic infrastructure, the Ottoman government needs to finalize plans for the Ruse-Varna Railway, connecting the Danube port city of Ruse with the Black Sea port of Varna. This project promises to revolutionize trade and military logistics within our borders. However, given the resources and expertise required, we have to decide whether we want to grant a concession to either British or French investors and engineers, or to rely on local experts to oversee the construction and initial operation of the railway. This decision has sparked considerable debate within the Empire. On one hand, foreign investment and expertise will expedite the project and ensure its success. On the other hand, commissioning to foreign companies would be more expensive and there are concerns about the extent of foreign influence and control over such a vital piece of infrastructure."
OTO_events.71.a: "Contact London."
OTO_events.71.b: "Use French capital."
OTO_events.71.c: "Trust in local experts."
OTO_events.72.t: "The First Railway in the Empire"
OTO_events.72.d: "As we strive to modernize the [OTO.GetName], the completion of the Ruse-Varna Railway in [GetYear] stands as a monumental achievement. Stretching from the Danube port city of Ruse to the Black Sea port of Varna, this railway is the first of its kind in our Empire, symbolizing our dedication to progress and innovation. This project not only enhances our trade routes but also fortifies our strategic military capabilities by streamlining the movement of troops and resources. This vital link between Europe and the Near East strengthens our ties with Western powers and showcases our commitment to modernization, promising a brighter future for our Empire."

In Sofia, the earthquake caused significant damage, with 70-80% of buildings severely affected. The poorer inhabitants of the city are in a difficult situation, having to rebuild their houses unforeseen in the run-up to winter. Some have been helped by donations, such as that made by Ivan Denkoğlu.In the case of the larger public buildings, the damage was more severe, with some partially or completely destroyed. The minarets of 19 of the city's 24 mosques were demolished, and only 2 of the 7 churches remain usable. Among the destroyed buildings is the Siyavush Mosque, which was abandoned after the earthquake. According to eyewitness accounts, the roof of the minaret of the Bash Cheshme Mosque, toppled over and stuck its spire into the minaret's spire. One of the arches of the newly built St Nedelya Cathedral also fell. The earthquake kills 4 people, including two children at the Siyavush Mosque and one of the construction workers at St. Nedelya. In some places around Sofia cracks opened in the ground, according to Filaretov the crack between Boyana and Dragalevtsi is over 20 cm wide and about 1.5 km long.

### Crete Revolt ###
####################
OTO_events.36.t: "The Mavrogenis Movement" 
OTO_events.36.d: "We have observed with growing concern the unrest brewing on the island of Crete, where certain elements, under the banner of the so-called Mavrogenis Movement, seek to disrupt the harmony of our rule. These agitators, fueled by anti-Ottoman sentiment and Greek nationalist ambitions, aim to destabilize the region and undermine the authority of the Sublime Porte. \n\nTheir rhetoric stirs rebellion among the local population, exploiting grievances and sowing discord. They invoke the name of Mavrogenis, a symbol of defiance, to rally support for their cause—a cause that threatens not only the peace of Crete but also the unity of our empire. These actions, however, do not escape our notice. We see their attempts to manipulate the hearts of the people, to poison them with notions of separation and revolt. \n\nOur response must be firm yet measured. The stability of Crete is paramount, not only for the island’s prosperity but for the greater security of the empire. The just laws of the Sultan protect all who live under our banner, and we will not allow a handful of agitators to disrupt this balance. Let it be known to all that the strength of the Ottoman Empire cannot be shaken by whispered conspiracies or reckless provocations. \n\nThrough vigilance and decisive governance, we shall quash the ambitions of these movements, ensuring that Crete remains a loyal and integral part of the empire. Let the agitators take heed: the Sublime Porte does not waver in the face of disloyalty."
OTO_events.36.a: "Worrisome."

OTO_events.37.t: "The Greek Revolt" 
OTO_events.37.d: "We are faced with yet another disturbance in Crete, where Greek agitators, emboldened by their dreams of independence and driven by foreign influences, have ignited rebellion against the authority of the Sublime Porte. This so-called Greek Revolt of 1858 is but the latest manifestation of the unrest fomented by those who refuse to accept the peace and stability that Ottoman rule provides. \n\nThese rebels, drawing upon the misguided fervor of their compatriots, have turned to violence and disruption. They seek to fracture the unity of the empire, spreading chaos across the island and inflaming tensions among the populace. Their actions are an affront to the benevolent governance extended to all subjects of the Sultan, regardless of creed or origin. \n\nThe Sublime Porte will not tolerate such betrayal. The revolt will be met with the resolve and strength that have safeguarded our lands for centuries. Loyal forces are already moving to restore order, while wise and fair policies will address the grievances that these agitators claim to champion. Let them see that the might of the Ottoman Empire is unyielding, and that treachery serves only to deepen their misery. \n\nThis revolt is not merely a challenge to our authority—it is a test of our unity. As we extinguish the fires of rebellion, we reaffirm the strength of the empire and the enduring bond between the Sultan and his people. Crete shall remain under the banner of the crescent, and the whispers of sedition will fade, as they always have, before the steadfast will of the Sublime Porte."
OTO_events.37.a: "That's not how we planned it!"

OTO_events.38.t: "The Rebels are stopped" 
OTO_events.38.d: "The rebellion in Crete has been quelled. The misguided agitators who sought to challenge the authority of the Sublime Porte have been met with decisive action, and their uprising has been brought to an end. Order has been restored across the island, and the banners of rebellion have been replaced by the enduring strength of Ottoman governance.\n\nThese rebels, who allowed themselves to be swayed by empty promises of foreign support and the delusions of separatism, now find their efforts in ruins. Their leaders have been apprehended or scattered, their cause discredited in the eyes of those who once lent them ear. The people of Crete, witnessing the swift and resolute measures taken, now understand the futility of opposing the just rule of the Sultan. \n\nThis victory reaffirms the unity and stability of the Ottoman Empire. The Sublime Porte has shown, once again, that it will not waver in the face of defiance. With fairness and wisdom, measures will be implemented to ensure lasting peace on the island, addressing grievances while safeguarding the empire’s sovereignty. \n\n Let this serve as a reminder to all who might seek to stir unrest: the resolve of the Sultan and the might of the empire stand firm. Crete remains an inseparable part of the Ottoman domain, and its people are under the protection of the crescent, now and always."

OTO_bulgarian_church: "[?BUL.GetFlag]The Bulgarian Church Question"
OTO_church_desc: "In the 19th century, the Bulgarian people longed for both national and religious independence, as the §LOrthodox Church§! in Bulgaria was tightly controlled by the Greek-dominated Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople. This control extended over Bulgarian clergy appointments and church language, eroding the Bulgarian cultural identity and fostering resentment among the population.The historical regions of Bulgaria are divided between Moesia, Dobrudja, Thrace and Macedonia. Each region has its own towns and settlements where Bulgarian culture thrive. In the dawn of Bulgarian Nationalism a big part of the towns in Bulgaria became more and more reluctant to the Greek church in Constantinople. If our stability §tfalls§! too much a wave of §Rseparatism§! will rise, which may lead to a schism in the church. The Nation Breakdown axis shows the confrontation between the pro-western Catholic §0Uniates§! and the pro-Russian Orthodox §7'The Young'§!.\nIf you want to see the §Rseparatism§! values for each state you'll need to §Yhover over them!§!"
