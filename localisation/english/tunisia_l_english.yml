### COUNTRY DESCRIPTION ###

  TUN_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Tunisia, a semi-autonomous state under the Ottoman Empire, faces a turbulent period marked by political instability, corruption, and a stagnant agrarian economy. Beys, from the Husainid dynasty, struggled to govern effectively, and urgent reforms were needed. Meanwhile, European powers, especially France and Italy, eye Tunisia’s strategic Mediterranean location, posing a growing threat of foreign intervention.\n\nTunisia stands at a crossroads, balancing modernization efforts with the need to protect its autonomy, as internal challenges and external pressures shape its uncertain future."

### LEADERS DESCRIPTION ###

  POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_II_IBN_AL_HUSAYN: "Muhammad II is the Eleventh Bey of the Husainid Dynasty. As Heir Apparent, he had excelled in military affairs and earned the rank of Divisional General within the Ottoman Army in August 1840. He was further promoted to Marshal shortly after he succeeded his cousin Ahmad Bey on the 30th of May, 1855."
  POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_III_AL_SADIQ: "Muhammad III, the Righteous, is the Twelfth Bey of Tunisia. He was 'Bey al-Mahalla' from the 10th of June 1855 to the 23rd of September  1859. The same day he was heir apparent, he was appointed Divisional General in the Imperial Ottoman Army. After the death of his brother, Muhammad II ibn al Husayn, Muhammad III took over as Bey as his nephew was too young at the time to rule, although he did end up adopting him. There are rumours about the British consul trying to persuade him to set up the first official printing press ..."

### EVENTS ###

  tunisia.1.t: "Last Appeal in Batto Sfez Affair"
  tunisia.1.d: "Today, Nassim Shamama asked for amnesty in the Batto Sfez case. A Jewish coachman awaits execution for blasphemy and a deadly coach accident during which a Muslim child was killed. His death sentence, handed down by an Islamic court, has ignited outrage among the non-muslim community and drawn the attention of European consuls over the protection of the non-muslim community. On the other hand, Muslims see it as rightful retaliation for a year-old case in which a Muslim killed a Jew and was executed. Tensions are high as both sides await Bey's final decision."
  tunisia.1.a: "His fate will be decided"

  tunisia.2.t: "Bey Decides His Fate"
  tunisia.2.d: "As Bey heard the argument of both sides, he could now fully decide the fate of Batto Sfez. The main question is if Bey decides to amnesty him.\nArguments for are that it would appease the non-muslim population and improve our weakening position on the foreign stage.\nOn the other hand, the argument against it is that we need to show to our population that rule applies to everyone and that we don't surrender to foreign pressure.\nThat said, the last decision lay right before Bey."
  tunisia.2.a: "Execute him"
  tunisia.2.b: "Freed him"

  tunisia.3.t: "Muslims Outraged"
  tunisia.3.d: "As news about the amnesty of Batto Sfez spread through our country, unrest started to grow mainly from the Muslim part of our population, who saw it as a great injustice and rulers' weakness in front of foreign pressure. The only thing left to us is to wait, and we hope it will be over soon."
  tunisia.3.a: "What will a protest achieve?"

  tunisia.4.t: "Muslim Streets Riots"
  tunisia.4.d: "As unrest grows larger day by day, it soon transforms into street riots. These wild gangs sometimes even guided by Islamic preachers against government officials, Jews and Christian foreigners throw our biggest cities into anarchy. Bey has already called the army to quell riots but it would take at least a few days to bring peace to our streets. Let's hope it will not escalate even further."
  tunisia.4.a: "This is not looking good ..."

  tunisia.5.t: "Non-muslims Outraged"
  tunisia.5.d: "As news about the execution of Batto Sfez spread through our country, unrest started to grow mainly from the Non-muslim part of our population, who saw it as a great injustice and they feared the potential influence of traditionalist Muslim scholars. The only thing left to us is to wait, and we hope it will be over soon."
  tunisia.5.a: "What will a protest achieve?"

  tunisia.6.t: "Non-muslims Ask Consuls for Support"
  tunisia.6.d: "Fear of potential Muslim street violence against non-Muslims as a reaction to their uproar Batto Sfez case was so high they created a delegation which asked consuls of France and England for protection. To our great misfortune they, as very active in our internal affairs, agreed and even asked for support from their respective foreign offices."
  tunisia.6.a: "We have to be ready to deliver a swift answer"

  tunisia.7.t: "Tunisian Delegations Audience in front of Emperor Napoleon"
  tunisia.7.d: "Today, the delegation of Tunisian non-Muslims is in front of Emperor Napoleon himself, asking for their protection against their Muslim neighbour. We have two options before us.\nFirst is to listen to them and send a few ships down to Tunisia and demand the signing of a guarantee of fundamental rights to non-muslims.\nThe second option is to just listen to them and then ignore them."
  tunisia.7.a: "They think He will listen to their pleas?"

  tunisia.8.t: "Tunisian Delegations Audience in front of Emperor Napoleon"
  tunisia.8.d: "We've got information that the Tunisian delegation managed to get the audience before Emperor Napoleon himself. Let's hope he will ignore them and they won't manage to convince him for some kind of military intervention. The only thing we can do is to hope for the best and prepare for the worst."
  tunisia.8.a: "Ignore them"
  tunisia.8.b: "Support them"

  tunisia.9.t: "French Emperor Ignores Them"
  tunisia.9.d: "Allah has listened to our most sacred prey as today we got the news that Emperor Napoleon ignores them and plans to do absolutely nothing in the Batto Sfez affair. This is the best result that we could dreamed of and is a huge win we could use to solidify our power against foreigners."
  tunisia.9.a: "We are victorious"

  tunisia.10.t: "French Fleet Spotted Near Our Coasts"
  tunisia.10.d: "This morning, the Bey woke up to the news of an unexpected visit from the French Navy. Nine ships armed with seven hundred cannons have been displaced in La Goulette. Their commanding admiral says they are here to help the Bey against any person who prevents him from granting freedom to his subjects and to assure them of the peace and security of their persons and their property. Meanwhile, we got news of a new message from the British Consul Richard Wood, who added that a British squadron anchored in Malta awaits his word if tensions flare between the Bey and admiral or if any threats by the fleet are formulated against the town."
  tunisia.10.a: "This is a dangeorus game..."

  tunisia.20.t: "French Fleet Spotted Near Tunisian Coasts"
  tunisia.20.d: "This morning, Tunis woke up to the news of an unexpected visit from the French Navy. Nine ships armed with seven hundred cannons have been displaced in La Goulette.

Meanwhile, rumours spread that British Consul Richard Wood had a British squadron anchored in Malta awaiting his order if tensions flared between the Bey and admiral or if any threats by the fleet were formulated against the town."

  tunisia.21.t: "French Force us to Create Fundamental Pact"
  tunisia.21.d: "It has been a while since the consuls of Britain and France (Richard Wood and Leon Roches) started putting pressure on us for a new bill of rights to ensure the security of both Tunisians and foreigners. Their influence over our government is rising every day. We must choose a side. Their demands have been condensed into eleven points composing the Ahd Al-Amane (Fundamental Pact), which will open our market to foreign capitalists and will ensure basic human rights for everyone."
  tunisia.21.a: "No land to foreign capitalists!"
  tunisia.21.b: "Accept their demands"

  tunisia.22.t: "Naval Bombing of Tunis"
  tunisia.22.d: "Tonight, the French fleet, which has been stationed near Tunis, has opened fire on the city. There is chaos all around the town, with many deaths have been reported."

  tunisia.23.t: "Start Creating Fundamental Pact"
  tunisia.23.d: "Today both delegations sit for the first time in front of one table on the topic of Ahd Al-Amane (Fundamental Pact). It will be the new bill of rights to ensure the security of both Tunisians and foreigners. Their demands have been condensed into eleven points, which will open our market to foreign capitalists and will ensure basic human rights for everyone."
  tunisia.23.a: "This is the beggining of something great"

  tunisia.24.t: "Fundamental Pact Signed "
  tunisia.24.d: "After a few days of intense negotiations, both sides struck a deal. Bey of Tunisia will sign Ahd Al-Amane (Fundamental Pact). This new bill of rights ensures the security of both Tunisians and foreigners. This will greatly open Tunisia to the modern world and show that we have a right to place between modern civilized nations."
