 great_game.52.d: "Russian expansion into Central Asia region brings our to question of response to such developments. Our greatest concern is stability and safety of our possessions in India, so our basic goal in Central Asia is to prevent Russia from getting into position which allows them to threat India in any way. This way, as part of The Close Border Policy we must establish and safeguard chain of buffer states between us and them. Russians seem to be quite acceptable for this, but there is still no common ground on where the border should be, on Amu-Daria river or to the south, in Afghani lands. With such approach we will be able to focus more on economic development of India. \n\nHowever, such defensive stance is not the only option in region. Russian control of Central Asia makes their border too close to India anyway, this opens some opportunities to threaten our interests in Persia and China too. We might consider The Forward Policy and try to expand our influence further into Central Asia. We will face fierce Russian resistance and India will require more defence developments, but potential benefits could be vast, especially if Russia will be driven out of Central Asia.\n\nAnyway, decision, which policy we choose, must be taken."

Qing China, after the win in the 1791 Sino-Napalese war, had gained control over the vast territory of TIbet and decided to prohibit border movement. Despite the decisions taken by the chinese warlords the British empire won't stop with this and will continue with its tries in forming a stable trading outposts north from the Indian company! "

The two we must choose from are Afghanistan and Persia.\n\nFirst one, located in Hindu-Kush mountains, is rather a collection of various tribes, cities and tribes without clear central authority. Despite such lack of solid governance, Afghanistan could play strategic role as natural barrier between our jewel, the Raj, and Russian Empire. Focusing our efforts on this land will give us more leverage over locals and prevent Russian influence, which will strengthen security of our realm.\n\nOn the other hand lies Persia. Comparably strong and centralised state, playing major role in regional politics, it's also controls way more wealth than its mountainous neighbour. Focusing on Persia will give us more economic opportunities, not to mention another possibility to deter Russians from their advance to the Indian Ocean.\n\nWhat do we chooose?"

We could not handle mass rebellion in such wide region with limited forces.\n\nInstead we might leave some lands to bukharan emir and establish protectorate over his lands.
