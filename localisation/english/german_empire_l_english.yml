germany.13.d: "The Germans, since they already own a trade port here in China, have taken the liberty to establish a military presence around the areas owned by them, often out of the boundaries of their trade ports...it is up to us to decide how to react to this, or whether to react at all..."
germany.13.a: "Alright..."
germany.14.t: "[QNG.GetNameDef] is intervening against our military presence"
germany.14.d: "Ever since we have expanded our military presence in China to the areas outside of our trade ports, unrest has been growing in those regions. Now they have overboiled and the government claims it was forced to take action to restrict our military access to the trade ports only - do we take that from them?"

germany.15.t: "The Baltic Sea Flooding"

germany.18.t: "Assassination Attempt on Bismarck!"
germany.18.d: "During his travels in Bavaria, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was subjected to an assassination attempt today!

Von Bismarck has been rushed to the hospital and is now being treated overnight..."
germany.18.a: "Let's pray he recovers."

#FLAVOUR EVENTS
germany.101.t: "Heinrich Schliemann - Excavations at Hisarlik"
germany.101.d: "Heinrich Schliemann, a wealthy tradesman and amateur archeologist from Mecklenburg, has recently started excavations near the ancient settlement of Hisarlik, at the Aegean Sea in the Ottoman Empire. Schliemann believes the ancient ruins of the mythological city of Troy to lie buried underneath these hills, and is confirmed in his belief by the British expatriate and amateur archeologist Frank Calvert. The team at the site seems determined to prove their theory over the next months and years."
germany.101.a: "Sounds promising."
germany.102.t: "Heinrich Schliemann - Priam's Treasure Found"
germany.102.d: "Breaking news reaches us from the Ottoman Empire, indicating the discovery of the ancient and mythical city of Troy! It was until recently considered by many to be a legend and fictional, but excavations carried out by archeologist Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlik unearthed the secrets that the ground had held for centuries. Schliemann also found a sizable amount of jewelry, gold and artifacts, which he believes to be the so-called 'Priam's treasure', named after the Homeric King Priam. The most notable uncovered pieces of the treasure include weapons mostly made of copper, two gold diadems and other copper artifacts. Although the findings are yet to be confirmed, this discovery has the potential to change the way we teach and view the history of Greece and its mythology forever."
germany.102.a: "What a discovery!"
germany.103.t: "Heinrich Schliemann - Mycenae Excavations"
germany.103.d: "With the help of other renown archeologists like Wilhelm Dörpfeld, Heinrich Schliemann has started new excavation works with the hope of uncovering further truth about Greek mythology at Mycenae, a hillside north of the valley of Argos, on the Greek peninsula of the Peloponnese. Schliemann believes this location to hide secrets involving the Mycenaean king Agamemnon, leader of the Achaeans in Homer's epic of the Trojan War, the 'Iliad'. After his discoveries at Hisarlik, public interest in this new excavation project is believed to be massive."
germany.103.a: "Schliemann is onto something again."
germany.104.t: "Heinrich Schliemann - Mask of Agamemnon Found"
germany.104.d: "A major breakthrough at the archeological site of Mycenae was registered today: Heinrich Schliemann, the German archeologist that unearthed Troy a few years ago, has discovered the Shaft Graves, a royal cemetery. Nineteen bodies have been uncovered in total: eight men, nine women, and two children, as well as the goods and weapons of the deceased that are present there. One of the most impressive artifacts found was a golden mask that Schliemann calls the 'Mask of Agamemnon', named after the legendary Mycenaean king Agamemnon. These findings are yet to be confirmed for their historical value, but it surely seems like another spectacular succes for Schliemann."
germany.104.a: "This guy!"
germany.105.t: "Konrad Duden's First Dictionary of German Spelling"
germany.105.d: "Dr. Konrad Duden, a grammar school principal from Schleiz, has authored a monography called 'Deutsche Rechtschreibung', or 'German Spelling'. As one of its key components, this book contains a dictionary of the German language that lists example words that follow his language principle. Dr. Duden teaches in a region where three German dialects overlap, each with its own spelling features, and the evaluation of the students' orthography depends heavily on the linguistic tradition their teacher was raised in. Duden's dictionary adapts the spelling of the words to be more phonetically accurate and consistent, and it seems vastly more practical and easier to learn and use. His work will definitely be used by experts to push for a unified spelling system instead of keeping the teacher-based language learning system that has thus far dictated which spelling variant the student learns. Since this work simplifies the German language, it is possible that those of lower education could become more literate than has been the case in the past, which Duden has commented that was his goal. He certainly seems intent on continuing his work on the simplification and unification of the German language."
germany.105.a: "Certainly interesting."
germany.106.t: "Conference for the Establishment of Greater Unity in German Spelling"
germany.106.d: "At the behest of the Prussian ministry of education and cultural affairs, 14 specialists of the German language have gathered in Berlin for the 'Conference for the Establishment of Greater Unity in German Spelling' or otherwise called 'Orthographical Conference'. On the basis of a draft by the Germanist Rudolf von Raumer, the participants will discuss possible solutions to the various problems in the days ahead. Dr. Konrad Duden, the school principal responsible for one of the most influential works on the topic, is also present at the conference. This sparks hope that inner unification of the country might be advanced further."
germany.106.a: "Well, good luck."
germany.107.t: "[PRS.GetLeader] Vetoes the Resolution of the Orthographical Conference"
germany.107.d: "The orthographical conference in Berlin ended ten days ago, and the specialists present did come to some important conclusions and presented their resolution to the public and the Prussian government. They have been facing considerable backlash from a variety of sources over the last days, however. Many critics doubt that the changes can be successful as they are deemed too extensive. The Prussian prime minister, [PRS.GetLeader], has today vetoed the resolution of the orthographical conference, and, thus, it has to be considered a failure. The struggle for some sort of unity in the German spelling system will continue."
germany.107.a: "That's a bummer."
germany.108.t: "Duden Publishes 'Complete Orthographic Dictionary of the German Language'"
germany.108.d: "Dr. Konrad Duden has finally achieved his goal of a comprehensive dictionary of the German language. The book is titled 'Vollständiges Orthographisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache', or 'C'omplete Orthographic Dictionary of the German Language'. It contains a staggering 27,000 words on 187 pages that fulfilled everything Dr. Duden wished to do with the current spelling systems taught in schools all over the German states. Unfortunately, it still seems that the Prussian ministry of education and cultural affairs and the prime minister, [PRS.GetLeader], who also happens to be Chancellor of the German Empire, has some reservations regarding the unification of German spelling. Be that as it may, the Prussian government has issued a ban on the usage of Duden's orthography in bureaucracy across Prussia. The reasoning behind this decision is unknown, but here's hoping that this will change in the future, as an easier way of spelling and learning would undoubtedly support the German language in the world."
germany.108.a: "That will undoubtedly have an impact."
germany.109.t: "Second Orthographical Conference Succeeds"
germany.109.d: "Following nearly three decades of debate after the political unification of Germany, the German language will finally have a unified spelling system. Thanks in large part to the continuing efforts of German linguists, teachers, and politicians, spearheaded by Dr. Konrad Duden, the Second Orthographical Conference had more success than its prequel 25 years ago. Over the last three days, 26 plenipotentiaries of the German states, Dr. Huemer as Austrian commissioner, and representatives of other institutions as well as the book trade met and discussed the standardization of a uniform German orthography in Berlin. In addition to state officials, a few experts took part, including Konrad Duden and Wilhelm Wilmanns, who had also already participated in the First Orthographical Conference in 1876. The resolution was accepted by both German and Austrian state officials, and, thus, is binding. It is also expected that [SWI.GetName] will join the resolution for German spelling shortly."
germany.109.a: "Finally!"

## POLITICAL EVENTS
germany.201.t: "South German Textile industry calls for low tariffs with France"
germany.201.d: "With the annexation, the Alsatian textile industry lost its French market, while the underdeveloped German industry face potentially dangerous competition. South German manufacturers pressure us to negotiate for low tariffs to prevent the Alsatians from dominating their markets. In response, the Alsatian textile industry united, setting aside their differences to advocate for their own interests. High French-German tariffs threatened to separate the spinning and weaving operations in Alsace from the finishing and dyeing operations in France. These efforts saw limited success. What shall we do?"
germany.201.a: "We don't care, we support competition."
germany.201.b: "Negotiate a 2 year transitional period with France."
germany.201.c: "Lower tariffs with France."
germany.202.t: "A Pro-french pastoral letter"
germany.202.d: "On August 3, 1873, a pastoral letter from the Bishop of Nancy-Toul was read in the circles of Château-Salins and Saarburg, which belonged to his diocese, calling for a prayer for the reunification of Alsace-Lorraine with France.\nThe Bishop, responding to the sentiments of his parishioners and the broader French population, issued the letter to maintain the spiritual and cultural ties with France."
germany.202.a: "Respond with police measures, disciplinary proceedings and the banning of Catholic press outlets."
germany.202.b: "Ask the Catholic Church in Elsass-Lothringen to stop spreading pro-french sentiments"
germany.203.t: "The Dreyfuß-Affair affects our population in Elsass-Lothringen"
germany.203.d: "The Dreyfuß Affair has sent shockwaves through France, but its effects are also being felt in Elsass-Lothringen. The wrongful conviction of Alfred Dreyfuß, an Alsatian-born officer of Jewish heritage, has ignited a wave of pro-German sentiment throughout the region. Many Alsatians, already wary of French nationalism, see Dreyfuß as a victim of deep-seated French prejudice rather than justice.\n\nAmong the Jewish population in Elsass-Lothringen, outrage is particularly strong. Many feel betrayed by the rampant antisemitism displayed in France, fueling a sense of alienation from their former homeland. Even non-Jewish Alsatians are unsettled by the affair, as it reinforces their concerns about France's treatment of minorities and its willingness to sacrifice individuals for political expediency.\n\nThis growing disillusionment with France has worked to our advantage. Pro-German attitudes are rising, making it easier for Berlin to encourage Germanization efforts in the region. While some remain loyal to their French heritage, many now question whether remaining tied to French culture is truly in their best interest.\n\nBismarck, though no longer in power, once remarked that time and patience would bring Elsass-Lothringen closer to Germany. With the Dreyfuß Affair, that prediction may be proving true."
germany.203.a: "Good for us."
germany.204.t: "French introduction of protective tariffs weakens our textile industry"
germany.204.d: "France has introduced the Meline Tariffs, a series of harsh protectionist measures designed to protect its domestic industries. Among the hardest hit is our textile industry in Elsass-Lothringen, which has long relied on exports to France. With these new restrictions in place, production in Mulhouse, Colmar, and Strasbourg has begun to slow, and factory owners are struggling to stay afloat. Workers face wage cuts and layoffs, fueling concerns about the region's economic future.\n\nThe economic impact is significant, but the political consequences are equally severe. Many within the Reichstag see these tariffs as a hostile act, aimed at undermining German industry and weakening our influence in European trade. Some advocate for retaliatory tariffs of our own, while others urge government intervention to support struggling textile manufacturers.\n\nOne thing is certain—the textile industry in Elsass-Lothringen will not recover easily from this blow."
germany.204.a: "Damn the French."
germany.205.t: "French law on the Separation of Church and State sparks Anti-French sentiments in Elsass-Lothringen"
germany.205.d: "The secular policy of France led to a prolonged conflict between the Catholic Church and the French state and caused a sense of alienation from France among Catholic circles in Elsass-Lothringen.\nThe 1905 French law on the Separation of Church and State, established state secularism in France, effectively ending the formal influence of the Catholic Church in government affairs. This law was part of a broader movement towards secularization and modernization in France but created significant tensions with religious communities, particularly the Catholic Church, which had historically wielded substantial influence.\n\nIn the Reichsland Elsass-Lothringen, the impact of this French secularization is deeply felt among the Catholic population. Many Catholics view the secular policies with suspicion and disapproval, leading to a growing cultural and political divide between the region and France."
germany.205.a: "Germany is superior!"
germany.206.t: "Rise of Socialism in France"
germany.206.d: "The growing influence of socialism in France has sparked unease among the conservative Catholic population of Elsass-Lothringen. Rooted in traditional values and religious faith, many Alsatian Catholics see the rise of leftist movements across the border as a sign of political instability and moral decline. Local clergy and newspapers have become increasingly vocal in their warnings, portraying socialism as a threat to social harmony and the Church’s role in society.\n\nEven those who once looked toward France with nostalgia now express doubt. With socialist agitation rising and anti-clerical sentiments spreading, many in Elsass-Lothringen are beginning to see the German Empire as the more stable and secure option. While Germany enforces order and respects religious traditions, France appears increasingly divided and uncertain about its future."
germany.206.a: "The Socialist threat in France."
germany.207.t: "Pro-German sentiments in Elsass-Lothringen"
germany.207.d: "The economic boom experienced by the Imperial Territory, also contributed to the spread of pro-German sentiments. Especially younger residents, who no longer had any contact with France, now naturally identify as Germans. This shift was further reinforced by the region's integration into our educational, legal, and political systems. During the late 19th century, Elsass-Lothringen underwent significant economic development under our administration. This economic prosperity, characterized by industrial growth and improved infrastructure, fosters a sense of stability and loyalty among the local population towards the German culture. \nWith the benefits of industrialization, such as increased employment opportunities and improved living standards, the pragmatic advantages of remaining part of the German Empire became apparent to many residents. This economic factor, combined with the social and political changes, gradually diminished the influence of pro-French sentiments in Elsass-Lothringen."
germany.207.a: "Für Kaiser, Gott und Vaterland!"

#Country Leader Descriptions
OLD_PETER_VON_ROSSING_LEADER_DESC: "Born on February 4, 1805, into a noble family, Peter von Rössing made his way into the political sphere after graduating from the University of Göttingen in 1834. He held a variety of offices following his graduation, being that of an auditor, an assessor, a chamberlain, and even reaching the role of High Court Chancellor within the Military High Court and the Military Collegium. It was not until May 1st, 1851, however, following the resignation of former president Dietrich Christian von Buttel, that von Rössing obtained his current position as President of the General Ministry. Since then, he has achieved several notable changes. The first of which was the constitutional revision of the Basic Law of the State of 1849, which was deemed necessary to alter in a conservative sense following the failed Revolution of 1848 and 1849. He also successfully managed to regulate the conditions of the Protestant Church of Oldenburg in 1853, alongside the reorganisation of the teaching and education system in 1855."
