 britishoceania.56.d: "In 1860 much of the interior of Australia remained uncharted. Some Victorians, made wealthy from the gold rushes, were prepared to fund exploratory expeditions. They had three goals: scientific discovery, seeking new grazing land and finding a route for an overland telegraph line. South Australian explorer John McDouall Stuart had already discovered productive grazing country during several expeditions from Adelaide to north of Lake Eyre by the late 1850s. The Victorian Government and the Royal Society of Victoria, spurred by a desire to maintain Victoria's position as the 'most advanced' colony, funded the Victorian Exploring Expedition and set it the task of being the first to traverse Australia from south to north. The expedition, one of the most expensive in Australian history, was led by Robert O'Hara Burke, an Irishman with no exploration experience or skills in surveying or navigation. It was lavishly equipped with items including 50 gallons of rum to revive tired camels (there were 27 of them), and an oak table. The expedition's departure from Royal Park, Melbourne on 20th August 1860 was a public spectacle watched by about 15,000 people."

In June 1863, 2300 acres were grazed as a reserve for Coranderrk Aboriginal Station. Indigenous testimony shows that Coranderrk was product and profitable. Residents' literacy increased and a better diet led to improved health.

The Protestant community hall was decorated with an image showing William of Orange, the 17th-century English King, defeating Catholic armies at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland. Given the tension between Catholics and Protestants in Australia this was a provocative gesture. Crowds of Irish Catholics gathered outside the hall, singing republican Irish songs and throwing stones. As the group was beginning to disperse the windows of the hall opened and shots were fired into the mob. A Catholic boy was killed and a riot ensued."

Children between the ages of six and fifteen were obliged to attend school and their education was free. In addition, all government funding to church schools ceased. Most of the religious denominations, with the exception of the Roman Catholics, allowed their schools to form part of this new system. The Education Act, although contentious and accused of being politically motivated, was the first of its kind in the Australian colonies, and Victoria became one of the first regions in the world to offer free, secular and compulsory education."

The main hall of the Exhibition presented a very difference appearance to that which it were on the previous evening. The last exhibits to arrive had reached their appointed places, there was no trace of the confusion which a few hours before reigned supreme, and when the aisles were filled with the dense throng of visitors, the eye could not rest upon a fairer picture, for apart from the ornamental effects of some of the mere artistically disposed wares, the original decorations of the walls were aided by a profusion of flags, which ran in a partly coloured line from end to end of the building, and the softened light which streamed through the stained windows heightened the effect of the various animate and inanimate groupings. Visitors began to arrive long before inaugural ceremony was begun, and these wisely availed themselves of the opportunity to inspect the exhibits before the different compartments became too crowded for that operation to be accomplished with any degree of comfort."

 britishoceania.75.t: "Depression"
 britishoceania.75.d: "During the 1880s, there had been a speculative boom in the Australian property market. The optimistic climate was fostered by the commercial banks, and also led to the proliferation of non-bank institutions such as building societies; as they were operating in a free banking system, there were few legal restrictions on their operations, and there was no central bank of government-provided deposit guarantees. Consequently, these banks and related bodies lent extravagantly, for property development, but following the collapse of the land boom after 1888, a large number of enterprises that had borrowed money found themselves unable to repay these debts, and many began to declare bankruptcy. Banks and non-bank institutions came under increasing financial pressure, and the full extent of the crisis became apparent when the Federal Bank of Australia failed on the 30th of January 1893. The situation was particularly acute in Victoria, and on the 1st of May 1893, the Victorian government implemented a five-day bank holiday to ameliorate the financial panic and prevent any further run on the banks. By 17th May, 11 commercial bank in Sydney, Melbourne, as well as other locations in Australia, had temporarily or permanently closed their doors. -- A period of prosperity in the 1880s led to a wild speculation in land and buildings, and money poured in from England. Land companies, mortgage societies, municipal bodies, building societies, and a host of other organizations all clamoured for a share in the good things that were on offer, and probably 40,000,00 pounds flowed into Victoria during a period of six years. With so much money in circulation, a fictitious prosperity of a feverish sort resulted. The banks issued notes to the value of millions of pounds, and trade and industry flourish as never before. The reaction came quickly. Public confidence subsided just as quickly. A run commenced on the bank, and the bursting of the boom brought with it widespread disaster. 14 banks failed, twelve of those with 905 branches throughout Australia, had liabilities assessed at 166,000,000 pounds, and thousands of people lost the whole of their possessions. Bank notes in many cases became worthless, and Victoria reached the farthest depth of a financial depression. Unemployment became widespread, wages and prices dropped and bankruptcies followed one another."

 britishoceania.90.d: "The first attempt at exploring the island was in 1857 by the crew of the Amethyst. They tried to reach the summit of the island but found the cliffs impassable. During the 1872–1876 Challenger expedition to Indonesia, naturalist John Murray carried out extensive surveys. In 1886, Captain John Maclear of HMS Flying Fish, having discovered an anchorage in a bay that he named "Flying Fish Cove", landed a party and made a small collection of the flora and fauna. In the next year, Pelham Aldrich, on board HMS Egeria, visited the island for 10 days, accompanied by J. J. Lister, who gathered a larger biological and mineralogical collection. Among the rocks then obtained and submitted to Murray for examination were many of nearly pure phosphate of lime. This discovery led to annexation of the island by the British Crown"

South Africa was one of the few destinations on the African continent that was relatively safe and comfortable for European settlers. It had none of the nasty tropical diseases of the West Coast. It also was out of the Rinderpest zone which meant that unlike most of Central Africa, horses could be used here. Another key factor was its location, many settlers on their way to the Orient or Australia may have been impressed with what they saw at Cape Town and decided to remain and try their luck in this colony. British settlers were attracted to the colony but often found that the best land had already been taken. Some of these moved on to Natal, others would move on to Australia and New Zealand instead. Although the British would gain a majority of the white population in the Cape Colony it would never be so overwhelmingly large as to allow them to ignore the demands and wishes of the Boer there."

 britishafrica.42.d: "Among the Cape's powerful local leaders, a radical faction under the leadership of John Molteno pushed for further independence in the form of 'Responsible Government'. After a political struggle that lasted a decade, Molteno successfully attained it. This brought all branches of the Cape's government under local control by making the Executive directly responsible to Parliament and electorate for the first time. Because of this, it is unsurprising that he was elected as the Cape's first Prime Minister."

MPs increasingly complained that the Parliament would not attract sufficient respect from "the public and strangers", unless a more grandiose edifice were constructed. A brief controversy has arose about this need to build a more stately Parliament, as the Prime Minister Molteno is not an ostentatious man, and has little interest in spending tax money on what he saw as essentially an expensive vanity project.

 britishafrica.45.d: "Construction for the new Parliament building began on 12 May 1875, with Governor Henry Barkly laying the cornerstone. Almost immediately it was discovered that Freeman's plans were faulty. Freeman's errors were compounded by the presence of groundwater, and a recalculation of the budget revealed that the actual costs would be many times the original figure that the government had allowed for.The Cape government stepped in. Freeman was fired for incompetence and the Public Works Commission was re-structured. There was initially some discussion in parliament about abandoning the half-finished building. However, the government ordered the project completed, even though the budget was now calculated to be many times the original sum. Henry Greaves has been appointed to alter Freeman's plans, fix the faulty foundations, and see the project successfully through. Moreover, it ordered him to remove from the plan the statues, parapets, fountains, elaborate dome and other expensive flourishes."

At the time Tewodros was insisting on the truth of his descent from the Solomonic dynasty, and Tewodros expressed his rage in many ways, including having Stern's servants beaten to death, and Stern, together with his assistant, a Mr Rosenthal, have been chained, severely treated, and the latter thrashed on several occasions.

However, the Emperor had a change in heart and Cameron was seized along with his staff, and all were put in chains. Shortly afterwards, Tewodros ordered most of the Europeans in the royal camp put into chains. If we do nothing to get our citizens out, our Empire will look weak."

Hormuzd Rassam is an ethnic Assyrian Christian from Mesopotamia and is quite persuasive, although with the arrival of another Englishman giving letters to the Emperor from the families of those that we have inprisoned, the Emperor has grown suspiscious of Rassam's motives.

 britishafrica.52.d: "The British Government attempted to negotiate the release of the prisoners held in Ethopia. At first, it looked as if Rassam might succeed in the release of the hostages: the Emperor showed him great favour, establishing him at Qorata, a village on the south-eastern shores of Lake Tana, and sending him numerous gifts, and having Cameron, Stern, and the other hostages sent to his encampment. However, about this time C.T. Beke arrived at Massawa, and forwarded letters from the hostages' families to Tewodros asking for their release. Meanwhile, Emperor Tewodros's behaviour was becoming increasingly erratic, his actions included acts of friendship towards Rassam, paranoid accusations, and sudden violence upon whoever happened to be around him. In the end, Rassam himself was made a prisoner.\n\nThis morning Her Majesty, on the advise of her government has announced a punitive expedition to Abyssinia. This is due to Emperor Tewodros's improsment of British subjects and refusal to release them. As a result of this, the decision has been made to send a military expedition to rescue the hostages"

 britishafrica.60.t: "Battle of Isandlwana"
 britishafrica.60.d: "The Battle of Isandlwana was the first major encounter in the Anglo-Zulu War between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. Eleven days after the British invaded Zululand in Southern Africa, a Zulu force of some 20,000 warriors attacked a portion of the British main column consisting of approximately 1,800 British, colonial and native troops with approximately 350 civilians.\n\nThe British and colonial troops were armed with the modern Martini–Henry breechloading rifle and two 7-pounder mountain guns deployed as field guns. The Zulus had a vast disadvantage in weapons technology, but they greatly outnumbered the British and ultimately overwhelmed them, killing over 1,300 troops, including all those out on the forward firing line. The Zulu army suffered anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 killed.\n\nThe battle was a decisive victory for the Zulus and caused the defeat of the first British invasion of Zululand. The British Army had suffered its worst defeat against an indigenous foe equipped with vastly inferior military technology.  Isandlwana has resulted in the British Government taking a much more aggressive approach in the Anglo–Zulu War, leading to a heavily reinforced second invasion, and the destruction of King Cetshwayo's hopes of a negotiated peace."

Lieutenants John Chard and Gonville Bromhead had to decide whether they should retreat or defend the station, it was agreed that they would stay and fight. They set about building improvised barricades from maize bags, biscuit boxes and crates of tinned meat.\n\nThe Zulu army arrived at Rorke's Drift at 4.30pm. They spent the next 12 hours continuously storming the British defences, which were mainly held by soldiers of the 24th Regiment of Foot. At first, they were unable to reach the men behind the barricades with their spears. Many Zulu warriors were shot down at point-blank range and the defenders forced back any who did manage to climb over. British soldiers who were too badly wounded to shoot, were tasked with reloading guns and distributing ammunition to those who could still fire.\n\nAs the battle raged on, the Zulus targeted the hospital. They set fire to the building, burst in and began killing the patients with their spears. But the defenders managed to push them back with bayonets. The surviving patients were rescued after soldiers hacked holes in the walls separating the rooms, and dragged them through and into the barricaded yard.\n\nAt the end of the fighting, 400 Zulus lay dead on the battlefield. Only 17 British were killed, but almost every man in the garrison had sustained some kind of wound. After the disaster at Isandlwana, the stand at Rorke's Drift was a welcome boost to British morale."

 britishafrica.65.d: "The London Colonial Office, under Secretary for the Colonies Lord Carnarvon, has decided to apply a system of Confederation onto southern Africa. However, it was largely rejected by southern Africans, primarily due to its very bad timing. The various component states of southern Africa were still simmering after the last bout of British expansion, and inter-state tensions were high. The Orange Free State this time refused to even discuss the idea, and Prime Minister John Molteno has called the idea badly informed and irresponsible. In addition, many local leaders resented the way it was imposed from outside without understanding of local issues. The Confederation model was also correctly seen as unsuitable for the disparate entities of southern Africa, with their wildly different sizes, economies and political systems.\n\nThe Molteno Unification Plan, put forward by the Cape government is seen as a more feasible unitary alternative to confederation. Despite this, London is totally against this local plan and believe a Confederation similar to Canada is the best option.\n\nUnfortunetly, South Africa will have to unify, it is a matter of how..."

 britishcaribbean.2.t: "Morant Bay Trial"
 britishcaribbean.2.d: "A black man was put on trial in the Morant Bay courthouse, charged with trespassing on a long-abandoned sugar plantation. The poor black Jamaicans of the parish were angered by this additional example of land inequality, and marched on the courthouse under the leadership of Bogle.\n\nAlthough the march was peaceful, the proceedings were disrupted when James Geoghegon, a black spectator, angrily denounced the charges. In the police's attempts to seize him and remove him from the courthouse, a fight broke out between the police and other spectators. While pursuing Geoghegon, two policemen were beaten with sticks and stones thrown from the crowd. The local authorities will most likely convict Geoghegon and send him to prison.\n\nDomestic affairs like this are typically handled by local officials, but we have the opportunity to intervene here if we can afford to pull a few strings."

 britishcaribbean.3.t: "Morant Bay Trial Aftermath"
 britishcaribbean.3.d: "The trial continued and Geoghegon was convicted and imprisoned. The following Monday the court issued arrest warrants for several men for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police.\n\nAmong those warrants was one issued directing the arrest preacher Paul Bogle. The police were unable to arrest Bogle because of the interference by his followers."

 britishcaribbean.5.t: "Morant Bay Rebellion"
 britishcaribbean.5.d: "The Morant Bay Protest started out in southeastern [689.GetName], who were protesting racial injustice, widespread poverty, and high poll taxes.\n\nThis then turned into an insurrection when several hundred Jamaican peasant-laborers marched into the town of Morant Bay, the capital of the predominantly sugar-growing parish of St. Thomas in the East. They then raided the police station and stole the weapons stored there. The crowd then began pelting the militia with rocks and sticks, and the militia opened fire on the protesters. This angered the crowd, who reacted violently, burning the court house and nearby buildings. More than 25 people were killed on both sides, before the militia retreated. For the next two days, the mass of rebellious black peasants took over the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-East.\n\nThe response of local authorities is to end this swiftly by suppressing the revolt and it's leaders. The only question remains, what shall we do about this insurrection?"
 britishcaribbean.5.a: "Ignore the issue and let the local authorities handle this insurrection."
 britishcaribbean.5.b: "The revolt will end if we appease some of their demands for racial equality."
 britishcaribbean.6.t: "Morant Bay Rebellion Aftermath"
 britishcaribbean.6.d: "According to one soldier, 'we slaughtered all before us ... man or woman or child'. In the end, the soldiers killed 439 black Jamaicans directly, and they arrested 354 more (including Paul Bogle), who were later executed, many without proper trials. Bogle was executed \"either the same evening he was tried or the next morning\". Bogle was hanged alongside 14 others, including his brother Moses.\n\nOther punishments included flogging of more than 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences. The soldiers burned thousands of homes belonging to black Jamaicans without any justifiable reason, leaving families homeless throughout the parish. This was the most severe suppression of unrest in the history of the British West Indies, exceeding incidents during slavery years."

 britishcaribbean.8.t: "The Jamaican Committee"
 britishcaribbean.8.d: "Opponents of Eyre established the Jamaica Committee in 1866, which called for Eyre to be tried for mass murder. More radical members of the Committee wanted him tried for the murder of British subjects, such as George William Gordon, under the rule of law, stating that Eyre's actions taken under the aegis of martial law were illegal.\n\nDomestic affairs like this are typically handled by local officials, but we have the opportunity to intervene here if we can afford to pull a few strings."

In 1871, Sultan Ali of Perak died. However, Raja Abdullah, the heir apparent, had not been present at his funeral. Raja Bendahara Sultan Ismail was proclaimed Sultan of Perak instead.

Indian opium, tea, silk, and saltpetre gave the company a reliable, convenient, and plentiful source of income. Although everything seemed to be going swimmingly, the situation within the Raj was reaching a boiling point. The British East India Company had been exploiting ethnic, religious, and tribal differences in order to attain control over the subcontinent. The Company had also enacted many unpopular western reforms that went against the beliefs of the locals, and new tariffs, along with other trade restrictions enacted by the crown, would cripple the internal economy of the Mughal Empire, reversing the proto-industrialization that was left over from the Mughal Empire, and the rich and prosperous eternal economy. Famines also became a glaring problem within Indian society, with over 60 million dying in famines between the 18th and 20th centuries. Many of these problems, as well as the introduction of cartridges made of pig skin into the army and the burden of British Rule, would result in the Sepoy Rebellion Of 1857 (Indian Mutiny).

 britishindia.24.d: "Strange news from the East India Company! A letter has arrived at the Prime Minister’s office from an anonymous East India Company official requesting an arrest warrant to detain and imprison Lord Canning, the current Governor-General of India. The letter contains a lurid account of instances where Lord Canning’s actions have caused the company losses and blames him as the ‘sole reason for the sepoys to have mutinied in the first place’. The letter seeks to arrest him upon charges of treason and corruption citing that ‘he has failed to uphold the interests of the British Empire’. Now, it is up to the Prime Minister to decide whether Canning shall be detained or allowed to remain a free man."
 britishindia.24.a: "Provide the arrest warrant"
 britishindia.24.b: "Reject this ridiculous request"
 britishindia.25.t: "London Provides Arrest Warrant"
 britishindia.25.d: "Great news from home! The Prime Minister has agreed to provide an arrest warrant for the corrupt and treasonous Lord Canning effective immediately. An armed escort of a dozen foot soldiers has already been deployed to carry out the arrest. Canning’s bodyguards seem to have betrayed him and refused to put up a fight. Canning’s assets have already been seized by the company and have been liquidated. A new successor is to be announced by the company at midnight. The Indian population has been apathetic about the events with one local reported to have said,”it doesn’t matter if they do it under Lord Tom or Lord Harry, I still have to pay obscenely high taxes.” Nevertheless, it is clear that a new era for the company lies ahead now that Canning can no longer sabotage our efforts."
 britishindia.25.a: "And so, Sir Frederick Currie shall be our new leader"
 britishindia.26.t: "London Rejects Arrest Warrant"
 britishindia.26.d: "Terrible news from home! The Prime Minister has refused to accept ‘such a ridiculous warrant based on unfounded claims that are clearly an attempted power grab by subversive elements within the company’. Rumours have also emerged from London that the Prime Minister has warned Lord Canning about a potential conspiracy against him and that he has sanctioned an escape route for him. We must act immediately with no delays. And thus, we send a dozen foot soldiers to carry out the arrest, irregardless of whether or not some Londoner agrees to our decision or not. The fight with Canning’s guards was brutal and savage but was ultimately successful. Canning is to be arrested and detained without trial with all his assets already seized and liquidated. The Indian population has been apathetic about the events with one local reported to have said,”all they will do is exploit us, whether it be under a Lord Tom, Dick or Harry.” A new era for the company lies ahead now that Canning can no longer stop us."
 britishindia.26.a: "We had no choice but Sir Frederick Currie becomes leader"
 britishindia.27.t: "Revolutionary Disturbances in Bengal"
 britishindia.27.d: "Disturbing reports from the Jessore and Nadia districts in Bengal have emerged of a crisis brewing in the area. The indigo farmers, under the joint leadership of Digambar and Bishnu Biswas, seem to be resisting the local indigo planters by refusing to grow indigo even under duress. They have already attacked intervening policemen and refuse to back down at any cost. In response to the hostility of the farmers, the planters have increased rents and evicted farmers, causing even more agitations to spring up. The situation seems dire and calls for government intervention are starting to grow louder. If there is any time left to act, it is now. What shall be our policy regarding these disturbances?"
 britishindia.27.a: "Send in the army!"
 britishindia.27.b: "Request time to study the situation"
 britishindia.28.t: "The Barasat Massacre"
 britishindia.28.d: "What was once a peaceful happy village in the middle of Bengal is now a scarred battlefield. Blood fills the streets and corpses can be found everywhere. The armed forces, initially able to arrest dissenting voices, were forced to resort to violence after the farmers refused to cooperate with them. Hindus and Muslims united in their struggle and managed to kill several planters before being shot. Even several women chose to partake in this orgy of savagery along with their husbands, using pots and pans to protect their lands. The indigo fields are now empty with most planters having fled their homes or killed by the farmers. An uneasy feeling shrouds the air as the last rebels are rounded up and executed."
 britishindia.28.a: "It was a necessary evil"
 britishindia.29.t: "Peasant Rebellion Worsens"
 britishindia.29.d: "The crisis in Nadia continues to worsen. A lack of government action has emboldened the peasants and violence has overtaken many streets. The farmers have cut down the indigo trees and mixed them with soil as an act of protest. Many indigo planters have already fled their homes with several killed by the dissenting farmers. The remaining planters have sought help from mercenaries and have engaged in continual clashes with the rebelling peasants. Not even the local zamindars were spared from the brutal violence."
 britishindia.29.a: "There is not much we can do"
 britishindia.30.t: "The Blue Rebellion"
 britishindia.30.d: "What started as a minor protest by a ragtag team of dissenting farmers has now culminated into a full-blown rebellion. Anarchy has spread throughout much of Bengal and the local army has been unable to control the chaos effectively. While several farmers have been hung for treason, the spirit of the rebels does not appear to have been crushed in the slightest. Even the Bengali middle class and intelligentsia have thrown their critical support for the farmers, utilising the press to spread their propaganda. The situation looks bleak for the company. If there is any time left to enact bold decisions, it is now."
 britishindia.30.a: "Negotiating is not the worst choice right now"
 britishindia.30.b: "The military is our only hope"
 britishindia.31.t: "The Indigo Commission"
 britishindia.31.d: "After nearly a year of rioting and anarchy, hopes for normalcy in Bengal have been reignited with the formation of the Indigo Commission. A total of 134 people including 15 government servants, 21 blue-collar workers, 8 Christian missionaries, 13 zamindars and 77 ryots shall give their statements before the commission. The witnessing process shall continue from 18th May to 14th August and is expected to provide insight into the flaws with the current system of indigo cultivation practised in the colony."
 britishindia.31.a: "There is hope for tomorrow!"
 britishindia.32.t: "The Indigo War"
 britishindia.32.d: "Looking at the smoke rising beyond the horizon and the ashes on the ground, it felt quite difficult for the {demonym} soldiers to think that an indigo field used to exist here. The once peaceful village in the middle of Bengal has become a charred battlefield. Little did the local garrison realise that they were one of the lucky few.\n\nTheir comrades in the rest of Bengal were the unlucky many. The resilient spirit of the Bengali ryots was best seen in the plains, fields, and villages. The {demonym} military, accustomed to European battles from the time of Napoleon, were completely caught off guard by the dissidents. The ryots did not share even an ounce of mercy for the indigo planters or the British soldiers; the privileged ones simply had their lands seized, while the majority was given a painful execution. Even the most iron-hearted bystanders could not bear witness to the execution scenes while the ryots cheered in an ominous tone. However, this should not negate the actions done by desperate {demonym} soldiers, holding on to whatever little land they controlled. Houses were burned, entire families were shot and multiple {demonym} laws were violated to bring about martial justice. The entire East was set on fire but there was a glimmer of hope as dissenting voices were crushed with gunpowder."
 britishindia.32.a: "The future is grim"
 britishindia.32.b: "The future is grim"
 britishindia.33.t: "Relocate Capital"
 britishindia.33.d: "After the territorial changes following the Sepoy Rebellion many have argued that Calutta is at risk of easily being captured in a future war. A good portion of the government believe we should move our capital to Madras, as it is further from harm than any other major city and could be more defendable. Another option that has been suggested is Bombay, while is geographically closer to the rebellious Indian State, it is surrounded by mountains so could be defended well. Finally we could remain in Calcutta and build up defences here."
 britishindia.33.a: "Move to Madras"
 britishindia.33.b: "Bombay is Best"
 britishindia.33.c: "Remain in Calcutta"
