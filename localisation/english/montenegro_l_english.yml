On one side, it's stuck in the hot frontier of the Ottoman Empire, from which it tries to gain its independence at any cost, by negotiation or by blood. On another side, it's a border with Austria, which holds it's rightful land of Kotor, which makes Montenegro isolated from the sea.

 montenegro.200.d: "We make great efforts to improve our agriculture and this country as a whole, but our striving had almost no effect. We ended with a lack of resources, resistance from some farmers, and bad planning for implementing reforms. But the world isn't ending here. We and our nation live on it. We should strive to improve our ways how to implement our reforms and learn from our mistakes for future."
 montenegro.200.a: "What a bad day to all of us."
 
 montenegro.201.t: "Agricultural Reform Succeeded"
 montenegro.201.d: "We manage to get over all obstacles we have in our way to successfully finish our reform. This will surely lead to better living conditions, but also to improved productivity and stability of our country. Reform's success not only bolstered food security but also contributed to rural development and economic growth. This will greatly improve our current situation on our path toward independence."
 montenegro.201.a: "Great achievement for whole nation."

 montenegro.229.t: "Reform of Industrial Sector Failed"
 montenegro.229.d: "Despite high expectations, the reform has encountered numerous challenges and obstacles, resulting in its failure. One of the main issues was the lack of proper planning and coordination, insufficient infrastructure, or lack of funding for our reform. We failed, but that isn't the end of the day, and we need to learn from our mistakes to make our other reforms succeed."
 montenegro.229.a: "We need to be more carefull in the future."

 montenegro.230.t: "Reform of Industrial Sector Succeeded"
 montenegro.230.d: "Throw bold moves to revitalize our nation's economy and embrace progress. We have launched a successful industrial reform.

 montenegro.230.a: "Great industrial power for great nation."

 montenegro.10.t: "Trade Agreement with Montenegro in Kotor Bay?"
 montenegro.10.d: "Today Montenegrin delegation came to us with the offer of signing an agreement about trade in Kotor bay and surrounding areas to the Montenegrin border. There are reasons for this, as it would economically stimulate the region, support local businesses, and many more. But there are a few reasons against it, as that could spark nationalism in the region, which Montenegro has claimed, or a little chance of a diplomatic clash with the Ottoman empire because they don't recognize Montenegrin independence."
 montenegro.10.a: "We have to accept this great deal."
 montenegro.10.b: "We shouldn't accept. It's too risky."
 
 montenegro.11.t: "Austria Accepts Proporsal"

 montenegro.12.t: "Austria Declines Proporsal"
 montenegro.12.d: "Today, we received an answer about a trade deal in Kotor bay. The Austrian side had refused our offer. They add to the official answer reasons why, as it would undermine their order in the region or that it's only cover by us to support Montenegrin terrorism in the area of Kotor and its surrounding."
 montenegro.12.a: "That shouldn't happen. Bad day for us all."

 montenegro.9.t: "Building of Danilovgrad"
 montenegro.9.d: "We manage to build the main phase of our greatest project. That's the building of a completely new town on green fields. Danilovgrad is planned as a modern city with wide narrow streets, parks, a sewer system, and many other citizens services. A city full of modernly-looking buildings, beautiful parks, and wide streets with plenty of shops is truly a collection of what can modern architecture offer. There are even some rumors that the town, named after Danilo I., should be the new capital city of Montenegro."
 montenegro.9.a: "Great project, but I would rather be back in Cetinje."
