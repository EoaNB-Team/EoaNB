One of them is full     Montenegrin independence, territorial expansion to ethnically Montenegrin territory or lifting the arms import embargo. Now, it's time for our delegation to say our stances on these requests."
 montenegro.40.a: "Accept their demands."

 montenegro.41.t: "Ottomans Offers Compromise"
 montenegro.41.d: "Ottomans send us a compromise proposal. In it, they are saying that they can't accept our full independence but are willing to compromise on certain points such as arms export or greater autonomy. As we are discussing this proposal, we are also acknowledging the variant that if we refuse the offer, it will offend Sultan. That would mean a military expedition against us."
 montenegro.41.a: "We have to accept this deal."
 montenegro.41.b: "We can't accept it. We have to stick to our goals."
 
 montenegro.42.t: "Ottomans Sends Army After Us"
 montenegro.42.d: "Ottomans were offended by our request for self-determination and independence. They have taken it so seriously that they send an army regiment after us. We need to prepare our defensive position and wait for their retaliation."
 montenegro.42.a: "Brothers, to arms."
 
 montenegro.43.t: "Montenegrins Refused Our Demands"
 montenegro.43.d: "Today, we got the answer from the Montenegrin delegation.  We got a negative answer from them, which means only one thing. That is the military expedition to crush these rebels and force our ultimatum upon them."
 montenegro.43.a: "Mobilize our army."
 
 montenegro.44.t: "Montenegro Wins"
 montenegro.44.d: "As mist and fog disappear from battlefields, it starts to be clear who was on top in this clash. After a short but bloody confrontation, Montenegro is a clear winner. We can only predict what will happen next. We can only predict if it will be a new agreement dictated by Montenegro."
 montenegro.44.a: "Truly interesting development."
 
 montenegro.45.t: "Fate of Herzegovina Rebellion"
 montenegro.45.d: "Today, the surrender of the last rebels in Herzegovina was announced, and now we will decide what will happen to them. But let's keep in mind that we have promised Luka Vukalovic, who is their leader, the title "Vojvode of Zubac, Kruevica, Draevica and Sutorina" and amnesty for all rebels who peacefully surrendered to us. It is up to us if we keep our promises, thanks to which Herzegovina's uprising was quelled."
 montenegro.45.a: "Rule Herzegovina with an iron fist to suppress any uprising before it can begin."
 montenegro.45.a: "Let's keep our promises to rebel leaders."
 
 montenegro.46.t: "Fate of Montenegro"
 montenegro.46.d: "Following the defeats on battlefields and the potential overall collapse of their army, the Montenegrin government decided today to surrender and admit defeat. We need to scatch demands, which would be definitely agreed upon in the Albanian city of Scrutari."
 montenegro.46.a: "Will this be the final battle that ends this confrontation?"
 
 montenegro.47.t: "Battle of Grahovec"
 montenegro.47.d: "Today, the Ottoman army was repulsed near the village of Grahovec. Our men bravely defended our homeland from the invasion of Ottoman troops. In general, it can be said that our commanders behaved heroically despite the Ottoman superiority they refused any dishonourable steps to ensure their victory. All they can glorify is the fact that the enemy was given time to bury the dead, and it was not decided to interrupt the water supply, which would have ensured us an advantage. Despite all the difficulties our heroes had on the battlefield, we won with all the glory that would soon spread through the world. We also managed to secure Ottoman weaponry in the form of rifles and also excellent cannons, which can serve us well in the future."
 montenegro.47.a: "Let's celebrate this great victory."
 
 montenegro.48.t: "Battle of Grahovec"
 montenegro.48.d: "Today, our army suffered a crippling defeat near the village of Grahovec. We lost our men, cannons, rifles, glory, and, most importantly, morale. Despite this loss, it is necessary to point out that the Montenegrin soldiers behaved honourably and allowed us to bury our deceased soldiers."
 montenegro.48.a: "It looks like it is the beginning of the end of our influence over Montenegro."
 
 montenegro.49.t: "War Damaged Lands"
 montenegro.49.d: "As a result of the war and the terror perpetrated by the Ottomans on our population, literally, hordes of refugees are fleeing from the borderlands that are under Ottoman rule to Montenegro proper, where they are looking for a better life. But unfortunately for us, we are not sufficiently supplied with food and other needed materials for them. Another severe fact is that there aren't enough jobs and land for them. We will have to take care of our fellow Montenegrins, although we are not prepared to accommodate them."
 montenegro.49.a: "What a terrible situation. We need to offer assistance to refugees."
 
 montenegro.50.t: "Uprising in Herzegovina"
 montenegro.50.d: "After a long period of unquelled unrest in Herzegovina, Luka Vukalovic gathered enough resources and stepped out of the shadows to escape Ottoman brutality. His main effort is to win the freedom of his people. Vukalovic has long worked with Montenegro, and we inspired him when we gained "de facto" independence in 1853. Our long and good relations suggest that we could gain a powerful ally in them. Or even a potential union between our two states."
 montenegro.50.a: "We are brothers in arms. Surely, we would support them."
 montenegro.50.b: "Play as Herzegovina. (Montenegro will support you.)"
 montenegro.50.c: "We don't want to risk another confrontation with the Ottomans."
 
 montenegro.51.t: "Montenegro Supports Herzegovina Uprising"
 montenegro.51.d: "Today, we got the news from our Herzegovina battlegrounds. Montenegro began combat actions in support of the rebels in Herzegovina. These rebels are terrorizing the population and murdering our men. Their activity had only increased these days."
 montenegro.51.a: "Their treachery will be rightfully rewarded."
 
 montenegro.52.t: "Montenegrin Revolt"
 montenegro.52.d: "Montenegro is the most famous supporter of the Herzegovinian rebellion. They gained such an influence in the area that what was originally peasant unrest now grew into a liberation struggle of the region from Ottoman rule. This situation brings to us many possible options for us how to expand our influence in the region. We can watch the situation more closely and use as much as possible to assert our interest. But there is a risk that if things don't go our way, we will have to consider diplomatic intervention."
 montenegro.52.a: "Our goal is to weaken the Ottoman Empire. We will support Montenegro."
 montenegro.52.b: "Let's watch the situation from a safe distance, it's too risky."
 montenegro.52.c: "We make commitment to Ottoman integrity. We will support the Ottoman Empire."

 montenegro.59.t: "Deportation of Mirko Petrović-Njegoš"
 montenegro.59.d: "As a result of the Scutari Conventions, Mirko Petrović-Njegoš, brother of Danilo I and father of Nikola I, has to leave the territory of Montenegro, mainly because he is responsible for the victory at the Battle of Grahovec, making him the symbol of the Montenegrin national resistance."
 montenegro.59.a: "Wish him a good luck on his travels."
 
 montenegro.60.t: "Territorial reorganization"
 montenegro.60.d: "As a result of our victory, peace was negotiated between us and the Ottomans. However, we cannot efficiently cover all of the conquered territories, and the Ottomans know it. Therefore, they might attack us again and take back their lost provinces. Fortunately, after their catastrophic defeat, they changed their tone and are now willing to respect us. Therefore, it will be in our best interest to hand over to them some of the territories before we lose them by force."
 montenegro.60.a: "We lose Sanjak, but we keep Podgorica."
 montenegro.60.b: "We lose Podgorica, but we keep Sanjak."
 
 montenegro.61.t: "Demanding War Reparations"
 montenegro.61.d: "As a result of the war, we have suffered enormous damage, which is why some people are calling for the Ottomans to pay war reparations to us. This can greatly help our post-war economic recovery. On the other hand, it would be surely very humiliating for our enemies and could damage their international pride and our long-term relations."
 montenegro.61.a: "We're a strong country that doesn't need any help from the enemy."
 montenegro.61.b: "Any help will come in handy. After all, it's their fault."
 
 montenegro.108.t: "Failure of Negotiation"
 montenegro.108.d: "The Ottoman Empire refused to recognize the independence of Montenegro because they still considered it as part of their empire. Therefore, the peaceful coexistence of our two states is almost impossible, and the problem will have to be solved with weapons in hand."
 montenegro.108.a: "Let's knock down the sick man on the Bosphorus."
 
 montenegro.109.t: "Failure of Negotiation"
 montenegro.109.d: "The Ottoman Empire refused to recognize the independence of Montenegro because they still considered it as part of their empire. Therefore, the peaceful coexistence of our two states is almost impossible, and the problem will have to be solved with weapons in hand."
 montenegro.109.a: "Let's knock down the sick man on the Bosphorus."
 
 montenegro.110.t: "Ottomans Offers Compromise"
 montenegro.110.d: "The Ottoman Empire is interested in an agreement with Montenegro but still regards us as their autonomous territory rather than a sovereign state. It is up to us whether we accept the small concessions provided by the Ottoman Empire or resolve the matter face-to-face with them at gunpoint."
 montenegro.110.a: "Let's knock down the sick man on the Bosphorus."
 montenegro.110.b: "We also support compromise."

 montenegro.117.t: "Jaroši batalions"
 montenegro.117.d: "On our territory, there are lots of uncontrollable armed criminal bands. These so-called Jaroši are potential problems, but they are also experienced fighters. So we could offer to pardon them if they joined our struggle in Hercegovina or even if they succeeded in joining our army there."
 montenegro.117.a: "The enemy of our enemies is my friend. Isn't that right?"
 
 montenegro.121.t: "Fall of Cetinje"
 montenegro.121.d: "We succeeded in capturing the capital of Montenegro and the centre of the struggle against the Ottoman Empire. With this great victory, we forced the Montenegrins to surrender, making it much easier for us to suppress the uprising in Herzegovina."
 montenegro.121.a: "Let´s celebrate this significant victory."
 
 montenegro.122.t: "Fall of Cetinje"
 montenegro.122.d: "Our capital has just fallen today, and we have suffered one of the greatest defeats in our nation's history. We no longer have any base from which to wage war against Ottoman expansionism. We must fly the white flag and throw ourselves at the mercy of the Ottomans."
 montenegro.122.a: "Is this the end of Montenegro?"
 
 montenegro.123.t: "Conquest of Outer Montenegro"
 montenegro.123.d: "Today, we received news that our army has conquered the territory of Outer Montenegro."

 montenegro.126.d: "We have now a report from a clash that occurred between our armies in earlier hours. It was firstly truly unbelievable, but after the raging battle calmed down winning side became clear. Our armies had been defeated and fled from the battlefield. This left our enemy with much valuable loot, which he could use as he wanted. It's truly a sad day for us all, and more specifically for close ones to them, who felt for nothing. Let's hope this will never repeat."
 montenegro.126.a: "We need more luck in future battles."
 
 montenegro.127.t: "Stalemate"
 montenegro.127.d: "If you get this, something is probably wrong."
 montenegro.127.a: "Oops."
 
 montenegro.128.t: "We Won the Battle"
 montenegro.128.d: "We have now a report from a clash that occurred between our armies in earlier hours. It was firstly truly unbelievable, but after the raging battle calmed down winning side became clear. Our armies had managed to strike a glorious victory over the enemy, which had fled the battlefield and left much valuable loot which can we display during our parades."
 montenegro.128.a: "Let's celebrate this victory."

 montenegro.165.t: "Departure of Henri Delarue for France"
 montenegro.165.d: "Yesterday, Henri Delarue left to return to France due to negotiations with the Ottomans had ended. With this, his diplomatic missions in Montenegro ends. This was the reason why he was sent to us. Other reasons were to help us manage administration and gather foreign support for our cause. Because he held the position of our chancellor, his place is now vacant. We must find someone who could replace him and continue in his job. This would be hard because it must be someone very educated with knowledge about Montenegro, some administrative skills, and many more."
 montenegro.165.a: "Let's find someone. Quickly."
 
 montenegro.166.t: "Jan Vaclík's Problems on the Border"
 montenegro.166.d: "Jan Vaclík answered our offer. He happily accepted it and was heading toward Montenegro. But when he arrived at the Austrian border, he got into problems with the Austrian border police. They refuse to let him across the border to serve our government. This left us with two options. The first is to leave him alone to figure it out and hope that he can make it. The second is to officially international support him, which is an efficient option but may prove costly."
 montenegro.166.a: "Let's leave it up to him to figure it out."
 montenegro.166.b: "Let's solve his problems with the Austrian authorities."
 
 montenegro.167.t: "Jan Vaclík's Problems Continue"
 montenegro.167.d: "When we left Jan Vaclík on the Austrian border without a reply, he became a bit desperate because his every attempt to cross the border by almost every means failed. He few times tried to contact us, but we were always silent. We need to contact him back and promise him our diplomatic support, or we risk he will leave back home. Jan Vaclík is too valuable for us, and our cause to be lost only because of the Austrian border police."
 montenegro.167.a: "We must help him."

 montenegro.168.t: "Jan Vaclík Successfully Arrived in Montenegro"
 montenegro.168.d: "Today we receive a message. Our candidate for the role of our chancellor had arrived in our capital Cetinje. He finally manage to get to us, even through his difficult journey. After he will rest, he has an audience with our ruler Danilo. It's expected that they would talk about Vaclík's potential new job, his life, and his work. Let's hope everything will go as planned because it's in the best interest of Montenegro and its national interests."
 montenegro.168.a: "Well, let's make him Chancellor."
 
 montenegro.169.t: "Question of New Chancellor"
 montenegro.169.d: "With Henri Delarue's return to France, we have lost our chancellor, so it is appropriate to find a replacement to help us build our independent state and promote our interests abroad. We have found someone who would meet all of our requirements. His name is Jan Vaclík, and he's a Czech writer, lawyer, and diplomat with close relation to Balkan and more, specifically Montenegro. He is writing articles and books about Montenegro, its foreign political situation, and many more. By our suggestions, he is the best choice we have."
 montenegro.169.a: "Send him our offer."

 montenegro.200.t: "Agricultural Reform Failed"
 montenegro.200.d: "We make great efforts to improve our agriculture and this country as a whole, but our striving had almost no effect. We ended with a lack of resources, resistance from some farmers, and bad planning for implementing reforms. But the world isn't ending here. We and our nation live on it. We should strive to improve our ways how to implement our reforms and learn from our mistakes for future."

 montenegro.201.t: "Agricultural Reform Succeeded"
 montenegro.201.d: "We manage to get over all obstacles we have in our way to successfully finish our reform. This will surely lead to better living conditions, but also to improved productivity and stability of our country.

 montenegro.229.d: "Despite high expectations, the reform has encountered numerous challenges and obstacles, resulting in its failure. One of the main issues was the lack of proper planning and coordination, insufficient infrastructure, or lack of funding for our reform. We failed, but that isn't the end of the day, and we need to learn from our mistakes to make our other reforms succeed."
 montenegro.229.a: "We need to be more carefull in the future."

 montenegro.230.t: "Reform of Industrial Sector Succeeded"
 montenegro.230.d: "Throw bold moves to revitalize our nation's economy and embrace progress. We have launched a successful industrial reform.

 MNT_decision_category_clans_desc: "The territory of Montenegro is not truly unified. It's divided into clans controlled area, which some have hundreds of years long tradition. A clan becomes a member's extended family, and loyalty to one's own clan takes precedence over anything else, including a Montenegrin prince or sultan. Each clan actually creates its almost own independent state. It's led by its own leader or clerics, has its own army, and also conducts limited foreign politics within the western Balkans.                                                                                                                                                             	              \nKuči Clan Loyalty : [kuciloyalty]   Strength of the Army : [?montenegro_KUCI_power]   \nPolitical Influence [?montenegro_KUCI_inluence]                                                                                                                                                            \nVasojevíci Clan Loyalty : [vasojeviciloyalty]  Strength of the Army : [?montenegro_VASOJEVICI_power]  \nPolitical Influence[?montenegro_VASOJEVICI_inluence]                                                                                                                         										\nDrobnjaci Clan Loyalty : [drobnjaciloyalty]    Strength of the Army : [?montenegro_DROBNJACI_power]   \nPolitical Influence [?montenegro_DROBNJACI_inluence]												                                                                                                                          \nPiperi Clan Loyalty : [piperiloyalty]  Strength of the Army : [?montenegro_PIPERI_power]  \nPolitical Influence [?montenegro_PIPERI_inluence]                                                                                                                                                          \nCuce Clan Loyalty : [cuceloyalty]  Strength of the Army : [?montenegro_CUCE_power]  \nPolitical Influence [?montenegro_CUCE_inluence]											                                                                                                                               \nNjeguši Clan Loyalty : [njegusiloyalty]  Strength of the Army : [?montenegro_NJEGUSI_power]  \nPolitical Influence [?montenegro_NJEGUSI_inluence]                                                                                                                                                         \nCeklin Clan Loyalty : [ceklinloyalty]  Strength of the Army : [?montenegro_CEKLIN_power]  \nPolitical Influence  [?montenegro_CEKLIN_inluence]                                                                                                                                                     \nBjelice Clan Loyalty  [bjeliceloyalty]  Strength of the Army : [?montenegro_BJELICE_power]  \nPolitical Influence [?montenegro_BJELICE_inluence]                                                                                                                                                         \nGrahovo Clan Loyalty  [grahovoloyalty]  Strength of the Army : [?montenegro_GRAHOVO_power]  \nPolitical Influence [?montenegro_GRAHOVO_inluence] "
