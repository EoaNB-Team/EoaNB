### EVENTS ###
acw_generic.101.t:0 "The Texan Civil War"
acw_generic.101.d:0 "Sam Houston has been ousted as Governor of Texas for refusing to allow the state to join the Confederate States. Now, he has raised arms and stormed the capital of the state, effectively putting the state in civil war!"
acw_generic.101.a:0 "Worrying"
acw_generic.101.b:0 "Onwards, Texas!"
acw_generic.102.t:0 "The Yellow Rose"
acw_generic.102.d:0 "We have done it! We have finally secured the state of Texas from our foes! This is a great victory for many texans, but other still have their doubts. Sam Houston, himself, being one of them. He wanted Texas to secede from the Union, not to preseve slavery or to destroy the United States, but so that Texas could be safe from the inevitible conflict. And yet, in order to do this, he had to bring Civil War to his own state. While it is regrettable, now is not the time for mourning, but the time to look out. We must ask ourselves: What is the fate of Texas?"
acw_generic.102.a:0 "We must rejoin the Union!"
acw_generic.102.b:0 "We must keep Texas safe from the Civil War."
acw_generic.102.c:0 "We must officially declare our Independence!"

acw_generic.103.b:0 "Dixie's gone, we must hold off the Yanks!"
acw_generic.104.t:0 "Death of Dixie"
acw_generic.104.d:0 "The Confederacy has surrendered. The very point of our side of this civil war has shattered, for there is no greater union that will accept us. We have lost support among our population, and we can only see that our armies shall suffer."
acw_generic.104.a:0 "I wish I was..."
acw_generic.105.t:0 "Silent Morning"
acw_generic.105.d:0 "The night had not been kind to Houston. He had been called it all: A traitor, a coward, and a madman. Looking from his bed, he stared at the starry night outside, out at the dark fields surrounding his home. It only seemed like yesterday when he stood at the Texan Congress, and refused to swear allegence to the Confederacy. He remembered every agonizing moment. He protested, declaring that the South could never succeed if it seceeded, that the only result that could come of it would be the destruction of Texas.\n \nHow ironic, he thought to himself. He turned over, pulling at the cabinent beside his bed, and he took out his notes. His unpublished speech, which he decried the attempts at secession and implored the south to not secede. He warned that the North would overwhelm the South, and yet... \n \nHis body ached, he knew what was coming. He did not have long to live in this world, and he expected every day to be his last. He did not care to properly place his papers back, instead dropping them on the floor and bed. He stared back at the window, the clouds parting to let the moonlight shine on the broken and devastated buildings surrounding his own. \n \nIn his attempt to keep Texas from destruction, he had brought destruction to Texas. He covered his face, and wept."
