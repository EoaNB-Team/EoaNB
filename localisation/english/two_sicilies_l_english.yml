NSC_focus_1848_revolution_legacy: "Legacy of 1848 Revolutions"
NSC_focus_1848_revolution_legacy_desc: "The revolutions of 1848 consisted of several riots and uprisings organized by liberal and Carbonari committees, beginning with the first in Messina on September 1, 1847. This movement culminated in the Sicilian Revolution, which led to an independent Sicily for 16 months before it was crushed by King Ferdinando II’s troops on May 15, 1849.\n\nDespite having forced Ferdinand to grant a new, more liberal constitution, the revolution fell apart when members of the Chamber of Deputies could not agree on the wording of the oath to be taken. This gave the king an excuse to dissolve the national parliament and brutally suppress all uprisings. Since then, he has ruled as an absolute monarch. The revolutionary leaders who have not fled into exile have either been executed or left to languish in prison."
NSC_focus_piscane_expedition: "The Pisacane Expedition"
NSC_focus_piscane_expedition_desc: "Named after its leader, Carlo Pisacane, the expedition was the brainchild of Giuseppe Mazzini. Its aim was to spark an uprising in the [NSC.GetName] and, from there, continue toward achieving Mazzini’s goal: a unified Italy based on social democratic republicanism.\n\nIn short, it sought to accomplish what the revolutions of 1848 had attempted but failed to achieve. However, the expedition met a bloody end upon reaching Campania, where it failed to gain the support of the local population. Pisacane himself died in the small town of Sanza, though it remains unclear whether he committed suicide or was killed by the inhabitants."
NSC_focus_ferdinand_ii_reign: "The Reign of Ferdinando II"
NSC_focus_ferdinand_ii_reign_desc: "From being a fairly popular monarch in the early years of his reign, he is now more known for his repressive tendencies.\n\nThere is no love for the king among the liberals in his realm, nor among the Sicilian inhabitants who remember the looting and raping committed by his troops. The savage shelling of the city of Messina by a naval flotilla, killing many civilians after the city had already surrendered, earned him the nickname Re Bomba, “King Bomb.”"
NSC_focus_continue_political_arrest: "Continue Political Arrests"
NSC_focus_continue_political_arrest_desc: "It is clear that after last year's cowardly attempt on the king’s life, and this year's attempt to start an uprising in Campania, we cannot let our guard down. These so-called revolutionaries must be hunted down. One of our top priorities is to have Giuseppe Mazzini tried and condemned to death for his involvement in both plots. He is currently in hiding. He and his accomplices must be found."
NSC_focus_political_repression: "Political Repression"
NSC_focus_political_repression_desc: "Despite our best efforts, we still haven’t captured several key troublemakers, including Giuseppe Mazzini. We must continue to apply pressure and crush all attempts to incite dissent."
NSC_focus_strengthen_troya_government: "Strengthen the Troya Government"
NSC_focus_strengthen_troya_government_desc: "Our trusted Prime Minister, Ferdinando Troya, has served us well, working tirelessly to preserve and advance our national interests. Such a loyal servant deserves our full support, especially considering that his own brother, Carlo Troya, is popular among the troublemakers due to his support for the Neo-Guelphist movement, which seeks to unite Italy under the Pope as king! We must make it clear which of the Troya brothers is the true patriot."
NSC_focus_kings_health: "The Health of the King"
NSC_focus_kings_health_desc: "Following an assassination attempt by one of his own soldiers in 1856, the king suffered a bayonet wound that later became infected. Since then, his health has never fully recovered. We can only pray for his swift and full recovery."
NSC_focus_secure_kingdom: "Secure the Kingdom"
NSC_focus_secure_kingdom_desc: "We have kept the pressure on the troublemakers, forcing them into hiding and leaving them more focused on survival than on plotting rebellion. But threats now come from abroad as well. Both France and England withdrew their ambassadors in 1856 after we, rightly, chose to follow our own path as a sovereign nation, rather than bow to their meddling. Most concerning is the growing hostility from England. They seem to have forgotten the close friendship the House of Bourbon once shared with them during the war against Napoleon. Now, there are signs they wish to limit our sovereignty and take control of our Sicilian sulphur. We must seek new allies, but the question is: where?"
NSC_focus_milano_incident_legacy: "Legacy of the Milano Incident"
NSC_focus_milano_incident_legacy_desc: "Agesilao Milano, a young revolutionary, offered to sacrifice his life for Italy by attempting to kill King Ferdinando II. During a military review on December 8, 1856, he attacked the king with his bayonet. Had it not been for the king’s pistol case deflecting the blow, he might have succeeded in ridding Italy of a tyrant. Agesilao Milano is now a martyr for the Italian cause. It will be up to others to take up the torch of a unified and free Italy!"
NSC_focus_military_analysis: "Analysis of the Military"
NSC_focus_military_analysis_desc: "With unrest stirring and foreign threats looming, it is time to reassess the state of our armed forces. An internal review will be conducted to determine whether our military spending is adequate for the challenges ahead. The findings will guide our next move, whether to expand, cut back, or maintain the current budget. The survival of the kingdom may depend on the choice we make."
NSC_focus_soldiers_state: "State of the Soldiers"
NSC_focus_soldiers_state_desc: "We should begin our analysis with those who have the fewest privileges and the most to lose in war, the soldiers, and see if more Agesilao Milanos can be found among them."
NSC_focus_generals_state: "State of the Generals"
NSC_focus_generals_state_desc: "The soldiers who support a united and free Italy will need someone who knows how to lead them. To that end, we must search among the generals for those who share our cause."
NSC_focus_search_political_allies: "The Search for Political Allies"
NSC_focus_search_political_allies_desc: "The failed Pisacane expedition made it clear that relying solely on domestic revolutionaries is not enough. We need international allies who can put pressure on King Ferdinand. Fortunately, we have two promising options. Relations between His Majesty’s government and both France and the United Kingdom have deteriorated. Napoleon III of France has previously expressed support for Italian independence and seems to have a soft spot for Italy. In Britain, the former chancellor and statesman William Ewart Gladstone has harshly criticized Ferdinand’s regime, calling it 'the negation of God erected into a system of government.' Finding sympathizers in these countries should not be too difficult."
NSC_focus_aquilas_count: "Count of Aquila"
NSC_focus_aquilas_count_desc: "The king’s brother is well known for his liberal views and is considered to be at the forefront of liberal thought within the royal court. Recruiting him to our cause would be a major boon to the dream of a united, liberal Italy."
NSC_focus_recruit_filangieri: "Recruit Carlo Filangieri"
NSC_focus_recruit_filangieri_desc: "Retired since 1855 after a falling out with a political rival, this old general could be a great asset to our cause. He proved his military skill by crushing the 1849 Sicilian uprising and his liberal leanings by convincing the king to adopt a constitution that same year, though it was revoked only months later. As governor of Sicily, he restored law and order, repaid the island communes’ debts, and reinstated their old privileges. He also attempted, unsuccessfully, to persuade the king to allow greater Sicilian autonomy. Filangieri’s experience and principles make him an ideal candidate for our movement."
NSC_focus_ferdinand_ii_death: "The Death of Ferdinando II"
NSC_focus_ferdinand_ii_death_desc: "King Ferdinando II of the Two Sicilies has passed away at a most perilous moment. A new war has erupted between Austria and the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, once again aiming to bring about Italian unification. With the throne now vacant and the political landscape shifting rapidly, the future of the Two Sicilies hangs in the balance."
NSC_focus_new_monarch: "A New Monarch"

But not all power has passed with the crown, his stepmother, Maria Teresa, is determined to maintain her influence over court and country. A quiet struggle for control has begun, and the future of the kingdom may well depend on who prevails behind the palace walls."
NSC_focus_confidence_in_people: "Confidence in the People"
NSC_focus_confidence_in_people_desc: "With the death of Ferdinand II, the court is divided and uncertain. While royalists cling to the old ways, there is a chance, perhaps the last, for true change. If we act swiftly, we can use the chaos to rally support, sideline the reactionaries, and restore the constitution. The time has come to place our confidence not in a throne, but in the people."
NSC_focus_open_political_discourse: "Open Political Discourse"
NSC_focus_open_political_discourse_desc: "With the death of Ferdinand II, the royal court has plunged into uncertainty. As rival factions struggle for control, we must use this moment to push for change. By fostering open debate and rallying liberal elements within the government, we can shift the balance of power and carry out a bloodless coup. The constitution, once cast aside, can be restored, and with it, the dream of a freer future."
NSC_focus_invite_exiles: "Invite Back the Exiles"
NSC_focus_invite_exiles_desc: "Many of our brightest minds and bravest patriots were forced into exile during the years of repression. If we are to build a freer and more united future, we must welcome them home. Their experience, ideals, and leadership will be invaluable in shaping the future of the Two Sicilies. It is time to heal old wounds and bring our exiled sons and daughters back into the fold."
NSC_focus_continue_ferdinands_work: "Continue in Ferdinando's Work"
NSC_focus_continue_ferdinands_work_desc: "Francesco II must uphold the legacy of his father, King Ferdinand II. Stability and order are paramount to preserving the kingdom in these turbulent times. By continuing his father’s firm rule and repression of dissent, we can maintain control and protect our traditions from the threat of revolution. The crown must stand unshaken."
NSC_focus_family_obstacles: "Family Obstacles"
NSC_focus_family_obstacles_desc: "Tensions rise within the royal household as Francesco II clashes with his stepmother, Maria Teresa. Their growing conflict threatens to weaken the monarchy at a critical time. Navigating this family struggle will be essential to maintaining unity and securing the throne against both internal and external threats."
NSC_focus_approach_austria_1: "Reach Out to Austria"
NSC_focus_approach_austria_1_desc: "In these uncertain times, forging strong ties with Austria could provide the support the kingdom desperately needs. By seeking alliance and cooperation, we can bolster our defenses against revolutionary forces and foreign threats. Austria’s backing may be the key to preserving the Two Sicilies’ sovereignty and stability."
NSC_focus_prepare_coup: "Prepare the Coup"
NSC_focus_prepare_coup_desc: "Maria Teresa is quietly gathering support to remove Francesco II from the throne. She aims to place her favored brother, Alfonso, in power, believing he can better secure the kingdom’s future. The time for careful planning is now, swift action is needed to ensure the success of this daring bid for control."
NSC_focus_enlist_maria_teresa: "Enlist Queen Maria Teresa"
NSC_focus_enlist_maria_teresa_desc: "Queen Maria Teresa’s influence grows as she rallies support to depose Francesco II. By backing her brother Alfonso’s claim to the throne, she hopes to steer the kingdom toward stronger leadership. Enlisting her in the cause could tip the balance in this high-stakes struggle for power."
NSC_focus_end_bourbon_monarchy: "Future of the Bourbon Monarchy"
NSC_focus_end_bourbon_monarchy_desc: "The Bourbon dynasty stands at a crossroads. Maria Teresa’s plan to replace Francesco II with Alfonso reflects deep divisions within the royal family. The path chosen now will determine whether the monarchy survives united or fractures under the weight of internal conflict. The future of the kingdom hangs in the balance."

NSC_focus_encourage_loyalty_desc: "In these uncertain times, the loyalty of our navy cannot be taken for granted.

# Events
risorgimento.600.t: "Dissolution of the Swiss Regiments"
risorgimento.600.d: "Following a law proposed by the Swiss government that would make serving in foreign militaries illegal under penalty of loss of citizenship, the Swiss regiments in our army revolted. The Swiss 3rd Regiment initiated the uprising, which eventually led to the Swiss troops marching toward Capodimonte to seek answers from King Francesco II. Fearing a larger riot, General Nunziante ordered the 13th Hunters Battalion to open fire on the Swiss soldiers. In response to this incident, the government has decided it is best to dissolve the Swiss regiments and establish separate foreign battalions for non-national troops, in order to circumvent laws like the one enacted in Switzerland. Although a few soldiers remain, many of the Swiss and Bavarian volunteers have since left the army."
risorgimento.600.a: "What a chaotic series of events!"
risorgimento.601.t: "The Death of King Ferdinando II"
risorgimento.601.d: "King Ferdinando II, the resolute monarch of the [NSC.GetName], has passed away after a prolonged illness that followed the assassination attempt the previous year. His reign was marked by fierce resistance to liberal reforms and relentless suppression of revolts, especially in Sicily. Now, with the king gone, the kingdom faces uncertainty.\n\nThe crown passes to his successor, but the wounds of recent unrest and growing nationalist sentiment threaten to destabilize the fragile peace. The legacy of Ferdinand’s rule — one of iron will and brutal order — will shape the turbulent years to come."
risorgimento.601.a: "The king is dead — long live the new king!"
risorgimento.602.t: "The Ponza Island Prison Break"
risorgimento.602.d: "Chaos has erupted in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Over 300 prisoners have escaped from the infamous prison on Ponza Island after a coordinated and daring breakout, likely supported by sympathizers on the mainland or abroad. Among the fugitives are numerous political prisoners — veterans of the 1848 revolutions, agitators, and dissidents long thought neutralized by the Bourbon regime.\n\nThough Neapolitan forces have since reasserted control over the prison, the escape has dealt a blow to the state's prestige. The Real Marina now patrols the surrounding waters, seeking vessels that may have aided or sheltered the escapees. Yet many have already vanished — possibly returning to their revolutionary cells or fleeing to foreign soil. The specter of 1848 rises once more."
risorgimento.602.a: "Find them — dead or alive."
risorgimento.603.t: "The Sapri Expedition Crushed"
risorgimento.603.d: "The ill-fated expedition led by Mazzinian Carlo Pisacane into Sapri, Campania, has been brutally suppressed. Forewarned by news of the Ponza prison break, local peasants rose fiercely against the insurgents. Over 20 conspirators were massacred outright, while another 150 were captured and handed over to the gendarmes.\n\nPisacane and his remaining men retreated to Sanza, only to face another savage assault by the local populace. Nearly 100 more revolutionaries fell, culminating in Pisacane’s death at the hands of the Sanza sub-chief Sabino Lavegilia. The expedition’s leader Giovan Falcone took his own life rather than face capture.\n\nRumors abound of merciless reprisals: cannibalistic acts, relentless women driving insurgents into the wilderness, and barbaric slaughter that left a dark stain on the region’s memory."
risorgimento.603.a: "Order must be maintained, whatever the price."
risorgimento.604.t: "Riots in Genoa"
risorgimento.604.d: "In Genoa, supporters of Mazzini were caught attempting to distribute letters inciting unrest and rallying support for the failed Pisacane expedition. Among the key conspirators apprehended are Jessie M. White and her partner Alberto Mario — both ardent revolutionaries with ties to the Mazzinian cause.\n\nThough the riot itself remained limited and quickly contained, Prime Minister Cavour has ordered heightened police vigilance throughout Piedmont. The government remains wary of any lingering Mazzinian plots that could threaten stability. Those captured face exile, mirroring the fate of Mazzini himself."
risorgimento.604.a: "The spirit of Mazzini continues to haunt Italy."
risorgimento.605.t: "Riots in Livorno"
risorgimento.605.d: "In the wake of the failed Pisacane Expedition, unrest erupted in Livorno today. Mazzinian revolutionaries, led by Maurizio Quadrio and identifiable by their tricolor armbands, launched an assault on the city garrison. The military command swiftly responded by firing three cannon shots from the Old Fortress, raising the alarm.\n\nThough the riot spread rapidly, timely reinforcements encircled the insurgents, quelling the rebellion. Seven of the insurrectionists made their last stand at the Colo Palace before being executed by order of Major Giovanni Traditi. The brutal response serves as a grim reminder of the state’s resolve against revolutionary threats."
risorgimento.605.a: "Mazzini’s spirit marches on through Italy."
risorgimento.606.t: "Legacy of 1848 Revolutions"
risorgimento.606.d: "The Revolutions of 1848 shook the very foundations of the [NSC.GetName]. What began as a patriotic campaign against Austrian domination turned swiftly inward when Sicily erupted into open revolt. Palermo declared independence, and Naples itself faced mass demonstrations and insurrection. In a rare concession, King Ferdinando II granted a constitution — but the gesture did little to quell the revolutionary fire.\n\nIn the end, only force could restore order. Sicilian cities were besieged, the revolt crushed, and the constitution swiftly revoked. Conservative ministers, handpicked by the king, now dominate the government. While the monarchy regained control, the scars of 1848 remain: distrust between ruler and ruled, memories of betrayal among reformers, and the lingering embers of rebellion waiting for a spark."
risorgimento.606.a: "Perhaps we were too harsh ..."
risorgimento.606.b: "Never again shall chaos threaten the Crown."
risorgimento.607.t: "The Cagliari Case"
risorgimento.607.d: "The capture of the Cagliari, a Sardinian ship seized earlier this year, has sparked an unexpected diplomatic crisis. Among its crew were several British nationals, prompting the British Parliament to condemn our actions and lend their support to Piedmont’s mounting threats.\n\nDespite the international pressure, our harbormasters remain steadfast in their resolve to keep the Cagliari under condemnation. This standoff places our kingdom in a precarious position — caught between upholding sovereignty and risking the ire of a powerful foreign ally."
risorgimento.607.a: "Stand firm and defend our actions."
risorgimento.607.b: "Seek a diplomatic resolution to avoid conflict."
risorgimento.608.t: "The Reign of Ferdinando II"
risorgimento.608.d: "Ferdinando II, the iron-fisted King of the Two Sicilies, continues to reign with a firm grip over his divided realm. Since his ascent to the throne in 1830, he has bolstered the military, repressed liberal dissent, and pursued industrial modernization — all while keeping a close eye on the revolutionary tides sweeping Europe. As new year comes, despite growing unrest in the south and discontent among exiled liberals, Ferdinand remains determined to preserve his absolutist rule and the fragile unity of his kingdom. But with whispers of rebellion and foreign interest in Italian unification growing louder, can the [NSC.GetName] survive the coming storm?"
risorgimento.608.a: "Long live the King!"
risorgimento.609.t: "Securing the Kingdom"
risorgimento.609.d: "We have successfully kept pressure on internal agitators, forcing many into hiding and curbing their ability to conspire against the throne. Yet, dangers loom beyond our borders. Both France and England withdrew their ambassadors in 1856 after we chose to assert our sovereignty rather than heed their counsel.\n\nMost alarming is England’s growing hostility. They seem to have forgotten the Bourbon house’s steadfast alliance during the wars against Napoleon. Rumors persist that the British seek to undermine our independence and seize control of Sicily’s valuable sulphur resources."
risorgimento.609.a: "We will rise again!"
risorgimento.610.t: "The Premiership of Ferdinando Troya"
risorgimento.610.d: "Ferdinando Troya, a seasoned conservative statesman and loyal servant of the Bourbon crown, returns to prominence in Neapolitan politics. A former general and royalist politician, Troya first rose to political relevance during the turbulent years of the 1840s, briefly serving as Prime Minister during the revolutionary crisis of 1848. His attempts to balance reform with loyalty to King Ferdinando II earned him scorn from both liberals and reactionaries, leading to his swift dismissal.\n\nNow, with the kingdom again facing pressure from internal unrest and the growing specter of Italian unification, Troya’s cautious pragmatism and experience may be called upon once more. Will his moderate conservatism bring stability — or will he be swept away by the rising tide of change?"
risorgimento.610.a: "A steady hand in turbulent times."
risorgimento.611.t: "Declining Health of Ferdinando II"
risorgimento.611.d: "The failed assassination attempt by Agesilao Milano during a military review in December 1856 has left deep marks on King Ferdinando II — not only in flesh, but in spirit. Though the young revolutionary’s bayonet was deflected by the king’s pistol case, the wound and subsequent infection have led to a steady decline in Ferdinand’s health. Once imposing and energetic, the monarch now moves with visible strain and delegates more matters of state to his ministers.\n\nWithin the palace, uncertainty grows. Courtiers whisper of a looming succession, generals urge a crackdown on subversives, and liberal conspirators take hope in the king’s weakness. Meanwhile, Milano, now executed, has become a martyr to the cause of Italian unification — and the kingdom finds itself increasingly isolated in a rising tide of nationalism."
risorgimento.611.a: "He will recover. He must."
risorgimento.612.t: "Adjusting Military Spending"
risorgimento.612.d: "In light of growing tensions and uncertain times, the [NSC.GetName] must decide how to handle its military budget.\n\nWill we increase funding to strengthen our forces, reduce expenses to ease financial burdens, or maintain the current level to balance readiness and economy?"
risorgimento.612.a: "Increase military spending."
risorgimento.612.b: "Maintain current budget."
risorgimento.612.c: "Reduce military spending."
risorgimento.613.t: "Army Reform Completed!"
risorgimento.613.d: "After months of careful restructuring, our military reform program has been successfully completed. Corrupt officers have been dismissed, outdated structures streamlined, and loyalty checks quietly conducted across the ranks. Training standards have improved, and supply chains have been reorganized to ensure our army is ready to face both internal unrest and external threats.\n\nThough some traditionalists grumble at the changes, the result is a leaner, more disciplined force—one that the Crown can depend on. With the specter of revolution still lingering and foreign powers eyeing our coasts, these reforms may prove critical in the trials to come."
risorgimento.613.a: "Nothing shall stand in our way!"
risorgimento.614.t: "Meeting with Count of Aquila"
risorgimento.614.d: "Ferdinando, the Count of Aquila and brother to the King Ferdinando II, has long lived in semi-exile, sidelined from Neapolitan politics. Though once a staunch Bourbon, his growing disillusionment with the regime’s repression has led him to quietly open channels with liberal circles abroad.\n\nNow, with the political climate shifting and the throne vulnerable, the Count has agreed to lend his name — and influence — to the liberal cause. His royal lineage brings legitimacy, and his defection could shake confidence within the conservative court."
risorgimento.614.a: "He will help us in achieving our dreams."
risorgimento.615.t: "Recruiting Carlo Filangieri"
risorgimento.615.d: "Carlo Filangieri, a seasoned general and statesman, once commanded royal armies with distinction and even served as governor of Sicily. Though loyal to the crown for decades, he has grown increasingly frustrated with the reactionary policies that have stifled reform and ignited unrest across the kingdom.\n\nRecognizing the need for a new direction, Filangieri has agreed to discreetly support the liberal cause. His military reputation and political experience lend much-needed credibility to our movement and signal that even the king’s most trusted men are beginning to lose faith."
risorgimento.615.a: "He will be a great asset to our cause."
risorgimento.616.t: "The Court Fractures"
risorgimento.616.d: "The sudden death of King Ferdinando II has left the [NSC.GetName] in a state of uneasy transition. His son, Francesco II, has ascended to the throne, but the real reins of power may not rest fully in his hands. Queen Dowager Maria Teresa, king’s Austrian-born second wife, has quickly moved to assert her influence over court politics and key appointments.\n\nWith Francesco inexperienced and cautious, and Maria Teresa commanding a loyal conservative faction within the palace, a quiet but dangerous power struggle is beginning to unfold. The direction of the kingdom now hangs in the balance."
risorgimento.616.a: "Francesco must assert his authority."
risorgimento.616.b: "Let Maria Teresa guide the kingdom."
risorgimento.616.c: "Side with no one and work on dismantling the monarchy."
risorgimento.617.t: "The Exile of Maria Teresa"
risorgimento.617.d: "After a tense and bitter struggle for influence, Queen Dowager Maria Teresa has been decisively outmaneuvered by King Francesco II and his supporters. Forced to relinquish her hold over the court, she has been sent into exile, removed from the political center of the [NSC.GetName].\n\nHer departure signals a new era under Francesco’s direct rule, but it also deepens divisions within the kingdom’s conservative factions. While some mourn the loss of her stabilizing presence, others fear that without her influence, reactionary forces may lose their grip — opening the door for liberal and nationalist agitation."
risorgimento.617.a: "The king’s authority is now finally unquestioned."
risorgimento.618.t: "The Plot Against Francesco II"
risorgimento.618.d: "Having lost the bitter power struggle to Queen Dowager Maria Teresa, King Francesco II finds himself completely isolated. The factions loyal to Maria Teresa swiftly move to eliminate any opposition, and the young king’s fate is sealed by a covert conspiracy within the court.\n\nWith no allies left and the palace turning against him, Francesco II is forced to abdicate and flee or face a grim end. The kingdom braces for a new era under Maria Teresa’s uncontested control, but the shadow of this downfall will linger."
risorgimento.618.a: "They are assembling in the shadows for the last strike."
risorgimento.619.t: "The Exile of Francesco II"
risorgimento.619.d: "Following his defeat in the power struggle with Queen Dowager Maria Teresa, King Francesco II has been forced into exile. Stripped of his crown and abandoned by key supporters, he departs the [NSC.GetName] to seek refuge abroad.\n\nHis exile marks a turning point in the kingdom’s turbulent politics. While Maria Teresa tightens her grip on power, unrest simmers among loyalists who see the young king’s fall as a betrayal of the Bourbon legacy."
risorgimento.619.a: "The Queen Dowager can now freely pull strings from the shadows."
risorgimento.620.t: "Coronation of Alfonso I"
risorgimento.620.d: "With King Francesco II exiled and effectively removed from power, Maria Teresa has moved swiftly to secure the throne for her son, Alfonso. Today, Alfonso I is officially crowned as the new ruler of the [NSC.GetName].\n\nThe ceremony is both a celebration and a statement signaling a new era under Maria Teresa’s influence. While some factions welcome the change, others remain wary of the young king’s inexperience and the queen mother’s firm grip on power."
risorgimento.620.a: "Long live King Alfonso I!"
risorgimento.621.t: "Creating a New Democracy"
risorgimento.621.d: "As the struggle for power between the young King Francesco II and Queen Dowager Maria Theresa intensifies, liberal forces have seized their moment. Backed by reformist officers, intellectuals, and urban revolutionaries, a coup has been launched to overthrow the old order.\n\nWith the monarchy in disarray and the people calling for change, the liberals have declared the birth of a new democratic government. For the first time, the Kingdom stands on the edge of republican transformation."
risorgimento.621.a: "Stabilize the new regime quickly."
risorgimento.622.t: "Allow [NSC.GetLeader] to Remain a Monarch?"
risorgimento.622.d: "With the death of Ferdinando II and growing unrest across the kingdom, questions are being raised about the legitimacy and future of [NSC.GetLeader]’s reign.\n\nLiberals demand constitutional reform or outright abolition of the monarchy, while conservatives insist on preserving royal authority. The nation stands at a crossroads, shall we reform and form a constitutional monarchy, or abolish the crown entirely?"
risorgimento.622.a: "Keep [NSC.GetLeader] as monarch under a new constitution."
risorgimento.622.b: "Abolish the crown and declare a republic!"
risorgimento.623.t: "Reinstate the 1848 Constitution?"
risorgimento.623.d: "In the face of rising unrest and calls for reform, liberal factions are demanding the reinstatement of the Constitution granted during the 1848 revolution, briefly enacted before being revoked by Ferdinando II.\n\nSupporters argue that restoring the constitution would calm tensions and modernize our state, while conservatives warn it would weaken state authority and encourage further dissent. The choice we make now may determine the survival of our regime, or its downfall."
risorgimento.623.a: "Reinstate the constitution to restore order and trust."
risorgimento.623.b: "No, we shall write a new one!"
risorgimento.624.t: "Voting Rights Debate"
risorgimento.624.d: "As liberal voices grow louder across the kingdom, the question of who should hold the right to vote has come to the forefront of national debate.\n\nProgressive reformers demand universal male suffrage as a symbol of equality and national renewal, while conservative elites argue that voting should remain a privilege reserved for property owners and the wealthy. The future of our political system hangs in the balance."
risorgimento.624.a: "Limit voting rights to the wealthy and landed."
risorgimento.624.b: "Grant universal male suffrage, let every man have a voice."
risorgimento.625.t: "Role of the Churches"
risorgimento.625.d: "With sweeping political reforms under discussion, the role of the Catholic Church in the new constitution is being fiercely debated.\n\nTraditionalists argue that Catholicism must remain the state religion, a pillar of national identity and moral order. Meanwhile, liberal thinkers push for a secular state—one where church and government are separate, and all religions are treated equally under the law."
risorgimento.625.a: "Catholicism will remain the state religion."
risorgimento.625.b: "Create a secular state, separate church and state."
risorgimento.626.t: "Question of Freedom of Speech?"
risorgimento.626.d: "In the wake of political reforms and rising public activism, the question of press and speech freedoms has taken center stage. Intellectuals and liberal reformers demand full protections for public expression, while conservative officials warn that unchecked speech could fuel radicalism and revolution.\n\nThe time has come to define the limits of what may be spoken."
risorgimento.626.a: "Guarantee complete freedom of speech for all."
risorgimento.626.b: "Allow limited free speech under state oversight."
risorgimento.627.t: "Holding Elections"
risorgimento.627.d: "With the constitutional framework now in place, the [NSC.GetName] is preparing for its first open elections under the new system.\n\nTwo major parties have emerged as frontrunners. The Partito del Progresso Nazionale, led by renowned liberal Carlo Poerio, calls for expanded civil liberties, freedom of the press, and broad democratic reform. Opposing them is the Unione Costituzionale, under the leadership of General Carlo Filangieri, advocating for measured reform, law and order, and the preservation of the cultural values.\n\nThe results of this election will shape the political future of our young regime."
risorgimento.627.a: "Support Poerio and the progressives."
risorgimento.627.b: "Back Filangieri and the moderates."
risorgimento.628.t: "Concluding the Convention"
risorgimento.628.d: "After months of intense debate between monarchists, liberals, and moderates, the Constitutional Convention has finally come to a close.\n\nThe delegates have drafted a new framework for governance, one that seeks to balance royal authority with modern liberties. Now, [NSC.GetLeader] must decide whether to endorse the final document, and in doing so, reshape the very foundations of our state."
risorgimento.628.a: "Sign the constitution and begin a new era."
risorgimento.629.t: "Reaching Out to Austria"
risorgimento.629.d: "With tensions rising across the peninsula and unification efforts gaining momentum, we are quietly exploring path of closer ties with the Austrian Empire.\n\nAustria remains a powerful defender of conservative order in Italy, and an alliance could offer us valuable protection against both internal revolutionaries and external threats.\n\nThough such a move may draw criticism from liberal factions and foreign observers, it could be the key to preserving our sovereignty in a rapidly changing Europe."
risorgimento.629.a: "Find out if they're up for a talk."
risorgimento.630.t: "Two Sicilies Wants to Negotiate"
risorgimento.630.d: "The [NSC.GetName] has approached us with a request to begin formal negotiations. Their representatives speak of cooperation, stability, and mutual interest, but the true goal is clear: they seek closer ties with Vienna.\n\nWe now face a choice. We could welcome them into our sphere by inviting them to join our trade union, deepening economic and political influence in southern Italy. Or we could reject their approach, preserving our resources for more strategically reliable partners."
risorgimento.630.a: "Agree and ask them to join our trade union."
risorgimento.630.b: "Refuse, we cannot afford to trust Naples."
risorgimento.631.t: "Austria Refuses to Negotiate"
risorgimento.631.d: "Our attempt to open formal negotiations with the Austrian Empire has been met with silence, or worse, polite refusal. Despite our appeals for closer cooperation and alignment, Vienna has chosen to turn away from Naples.\n\nThis rejection is a clear signal: we must now reconsider our diplomatic course. Whether we look inward, toward reform, or outward, toward new allies, the path forward will no longer include Austrian support."
risorgimento.631.a: "They had their chance."
risorgimento.632.t: "Austria Invites Us to Join Their Trade Union"
risorgimento.632.d: "The Austrian Empire has extended a formal invitation for the [NSC.GetName] to join its trade union, a powerful economic bloc designed to strengthen Vienna’s influence across the Italian peninsula.\n\nWhile membership could bring increased trade and access to broader markets, it may also tie our economy, and our future, closely to Austrian interests. Accepting could offer stability, but at the cost of independence. Rejecting may preserve our autonomy, but risk isolation in a rapidly changing Europe."
risorgimento.632.a: "We accept their offer."
risorgimento.632.b: "Refuse their proposal."
risorgimento.633.t: "The Two Sicilies Ends Negotiations"
risorgimento.633.d: "Without warning, the [NSC.GetName] has abruptly ended diplomatic negotiations with our representatives.\n\nWhether due to internal pressures, shifting alliances, or a change in strategy, this sudden withdrawal leaves our discussions unresolved and our influence in the south uncertain. Vienna must now reassess its position in Italy, as Naples appears intent on charting its own course."
risorgimento.633.a: "They had their chance."
risorgimento.634.t: "Two Sicilies Joins Our Trade Union"
risorgimento.634.d: "The [NSC.GetName] has formally agreed to join our trade union, marking a significant step forward in strengthening Austria’s economic influence across the Italian peninsula.\n\nWith Naples now integrated into our customs framework, trade between our nations is expected to grow, and our position in southern Europe is considerably reinforced. This move brings stability and also binds the Two Sicilies closer to Vienna’s orbit."
risorgimento.634.a: "Proposes an exchange of docking rights."
risorgimento.635.t: "Austria Proposes Docking Rights Exchange"
risorgimento.635.d: "The Austrian Empire has proposed a mutual agreement to exchange naval docking rights, allowing both of our fleets access to each other’s ports for resupply, repairs, and strategic presence in the Mediterranean.\n\nSuch an agreement could deepen military cooperation and strengthen our position at sea, but it also raises concerns about sovereignty and increased Austrian influence in our coastal affairs. We must weigh the benefits of collaboration against the risks of dependency."
risorgimento.635.a: "We accept their offer."
risorgimento.635.b: "Refuse their proposal."
risorgimento.636.t: "Two Sicilies Agrees to Docking Rights Exchange"
risorgimento.636.d: "The [NSC.GetName] has accepted our proposal for a mutual docking rights agreement, allowing both our navies to access each other’s ports across the Adriatic and the Mediterranean.\n\nThis development strengthens our maritime reach and deepens strategic cooperation between Vienna and Naples. It is a quiet but meaningful step toward greater influence in southern waters, and a sign that Naples may be open to further alignment."
risorgimento.636.a: "Proposes signing a non-aggression pact."
risorgimento.637.t: "Austria Proposes a Non-Aggression Pact"
risorgimento.637.d: "The Austrian Empire has approached us with a proposal for a non-aggression pact, aiming to guarantee peace between our two states during a time of rising instability in the Italian peninsula.\n\nWhile such an agreement could secure our northern border and buy time to focus on internal matters, it may also signal weakness to our liberal opposition and limit our diplomatic flexibility. Accepting could bring stability, refusing might keep our options open."
risorgimento.637.a: "This will ensure our protection!"
risorgimento.637.b: "We don’t require protection!"
risorgimento.638.t: "Two Sicilies Agrees to a Pact of Non-Aggression"
risorgimento.638.d: "The [NSC.GetName] has agreed to our offer of a non-aggression pact, signaling a mutual desire to avoid conflict and maintain peace in the increasingly unstable Italian peninsula.\n\nThough not a formal alliance, this pact secures our southern flank and opens the door to deeper cooperation. For now, Vienna and Naples stand apart from the growing storm of revolution and unification."
risorgimento.638.a: "Finalize negotiations."
risorgimento.639.t: "Austrian Negotiations Successfully Concluded"
risorgimento.639.d: "After a series of formal exchanges and diplomatic visits, negotiations between the [NSC.GetName] and the Austrian Empire have come to a close.\n\nThe outcome marks a turning point in relations. Whether through trade agreements, military cooperation, or mutual guarantees, both states have clarified their positions in a rapidly shifting Italian landscape. For better or worse, a new chapter in Neapolitan-Austrian diplomacy has begun."
risorgimento.639.a: "We have obtained what we needed."
risorgimento.640.t: "The State of Italian Affairs"
risorgimento.640.d: "Italy remains a fractured land, torn between competing kingdoms, foreign influence, and rising nationalist fervor. The [NSC.GetName] watches warily as Piedmont, backed by powerful allies, pushes toward unification under its banner.\n\nWhile many Italians dream of a united Italy, we remain cautious of losing our sovereignty and identity. The revolutions and uprisings that have swept the peninsula serve as a stark reminder: Italy’s future is uncertain, and the struggle for power continues both within and beyond our borders."
risorgimento.640.a: "We must strengthen our kingdom to survive the chaos."
risorgimento.641.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont — Two Sicilies Relations"
risorgimento.641.d: "Relations between the [NSC.GetName] and the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont remain tense and fraught with suspicion. Sardinia, under Cavour’s leadership, pushes aggressively for Italian unification, often at the expense of southern interests.\n\nMeanwhile, the Two Sicilies seeks to maintain its sovereignty and resist Piedmont’s expansionist ambitions. Diplomatic efforts continue, but both sides prepare cautiously for the possibility of conflict."
risorgimento.641.a: "Prepare our defenses, but maintain the dialogue."
risorgimento.642.t: "Political Prisoners Status"
risorgimento.642.d: "The [NSC.GetName] currently holds numerous political prisoners, many of whom were involved in recent revolutionary movements. Their detention has drawn criticism from France and the United Kingdom, souring diplomatic relations.\n\nReleasing these prisoners could improve ties with these powers and ease international pressure, but risks empowering our internal dissenters."
risorgimento.642.a: "Keep the prisoners detained to maintain internal security."
risorgimento.642.b: "Free the political prisoners to appease foreign powers."
risorgimento.643.t: "Non-Aggression Pact with Papal State"
risorgimento.643.d: "The [NSC.GetName] has formally agreed to a non-aggression pact with the Papal States. This agreement aims to secure peace between our realms and strengthen our position against external threats.\n\nThe pact also signals a united front against the rising tide of revolutionary movements sweeping across Italy, reinforcing conservative values and preserving our shared interests."
risorgimento.643.a: "Honor the pact and strengthen ties with the Papal States."
risorgimento.644.t: "The Condition in Sicily"
risorgimento.644.d: "Sicily remains a land scarred by recent revolts and unrest, with many towns still recovering from the harsh sieges and military actions taken to restore order.\n\nThe people of the island harbor deep resentment towards the central government, and economic hardship only fuels the growing discontent. It is clear that a long and careful process of reconciliation and reform will be necessary to secure lasting peace."
risorgimento.644.a: "We have to modernize if we are to bring true peace."
risorgimento.645.t: "Salvatore Maniscalco's Work"
risorgimento.645.d: "Salvatore Maniscalco, the staunch loyalist and determined enforcer of royal authority, has launched a vigorous campaign to crush revolutionary activity across Sicily. His efforts target insurgent networks, clandestine societies, and radical agitators seeking to undermine the Bourbon state.\n\nThrough decisive policing, swift arrests, and visible shows of force, Maniscalco aims to restore law and order to the troubled island. While his methods have been praised by conservatives for safeguarding stability, liberals decry them as heavy-handed and repressive. Sicily now stands at a fragile crossroads between calm and further unrest."
risorgimento.645.a: "Back Maniscalco’s fight against revolutionaries."
risorgimento.645.b: "Limit his influence to avoid provoking popular unrest."
risorgimento.646.t: "Defence Treaty With Austria"
risorgimento.646.d: "In response to growing instability and external threats, the [NSC.GetName] has formally proposed a defence treaty to the Austrian Empire. We seek a strong alliance to safeguard our sovereignty and counter revolutionary forces spreading across Italy.\n\nWhile this alliance promises greater security, it may also pull us into Austria’s complex political struggles. The outcome of this proposal will shape our future standing in the region."
risorgimento.646.a: "Push for a swift agreement to solidify our position."
risorgimento.647.t: "Two Sicilies Wants a Defence Treaty"
risorgimento.647.d: "The [NSC.GetName] has approached us with a proposal for a defence treaty, aiming to secure mutual protection against revolutionary uprisings and rival Italian states.\n\nWe must weigh the benefits of expanding its influence in southern Italy against the risks of becoming entangled in local conflicts. The decision will impact our standing both within the Italian peninsula and across Europe."

risorgimento.647.b: "We want nothing to do with them."
risorgimento.648.t: "Austria Accepts Our Defence Treaty Offer"
risorgimento.648.d: "The Austrian Empire has accepted our proposal for a defence treaty. This alliance marks a significant step toward securing our borders and reinforcing our position against revolutionary and external threats.\n\nWhile the partnership strengthens our military capabilities, it also binds us closer to Austria’s political ambitions in Italy. Careful diplomacy will be needed to navigate this new alliance."
risorgimento.648.a: "They made the right choice."
risorgimento.649.t: "Austria Denies Our Defence Treaty Offer"
risorgimento.649.d: "The Austrian Empire has declined our proposal for a defence treaty. This refusal leaves us more vulnerable amid growing revolutionary unrest and regional tensions.\n\nWithout Austrian support, we must reconsider our diplomatic strategies and strengthen our own defenses to face the uncertain future."
risorgimento.649.a: "They missed a great opportunity ..."
risorgimento.650.t: "The Austrian Menace"
risorgimento.650.d: "Austria continues to cast a long shadow over the Italian peninsula, meddling in our affairs and tightening its grip on the north. Their refusal to recognize our sovereignty in regional matters and their support for reactionary elements threaten our future.\n\nIn response, we have sent a discreet offer to the Kingdom of Sardinia, proposing a non-aggression pact directed at limiting Austrian influence. Though relations with Sardinia remain complicated, necessity may yet forge unlikely allies."
risorgimento.650.a: "Send the proposal, we must counter Austria’s influence."
risorgimento.651.t: "Two Sicilies Wants a Non-Aggression Pact"
risorgimento.651.d: "In a bold move, the [NSC.GetName] has sent us an offer for a non-aggression pact, specifically aimed at containing Austrian influence in Italy.\n\nThough historically at odds, both our kingdoms recognize the growing threat posed by Austria’s grip on the peninsula. A temporary understanding between us may buy us time, reduce tensions, and open the door for a broader anti-Austrian alignment."
risorgimento.651.a: "Accept the proposal, Austria must be contained."
risorgimento.651.b: "Refuse, we cannot trust Naples."
risorgimento.652.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Accepts Non-Aggression Pact Offer"
risorgimento.652.d: "Against all expectations, the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont has agreed to our proposal for a non-aggression pact aimed at curbing Austrian influence in Italy.\n\nThough past rivalries run deep, this agreement marks a potential turning point. For now, open conflict between our kingdoms is off the table, allowing us both to focus on the greater threat to Italian autonomy — Vienna."
risorgimento.652.a: "Try to also negotiate a defensive pact against Austria."
risorgimento.652.b: "That's enough negotiating for today."
risorgimento.653.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Denies Non-Aggression Pact Offer"
risorgimento.653.d: "The Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont has rejected our offer for a non-aggression pact aimed at countering Austrian dominance in Italy.\n\nTheir refusal is a clear signal — they continue to view us as rivals, not partners. With both Austria and Piedmont standing opposed to our position, we must now prepare for isolation or find new allies to safeguard our sovereignty."
risorgimento.653.a: "We stand alone, but we will not bow."
risorgimento.654.t: "Two Sicilies Wants a Defensive Pact Against Austria"
risorgimento.654.d: "The [NSC.GetName] has approached us yet again, this time with a proposal for a defensive pact aimed squarely against Austrian influence in Italy.\n\nThis unexpected move places us at a crossroads: do we want to confront old rivalries, or attempt to negotiate peace and maintain stability in the region?"
risorgimento.654.a: "Accept the proposal, Austria must be contained."
risorgimento.654.b: "Refuse, non-aggression pact is enought."
risorgimento.655.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Accepts Defensive Pact Offer"
risorgimento.655.d: "Against all odds, the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont has accepted our offer for a defensive pact aimed at countering Austrian dominance in Italy.\n\nThis alliance marks a significant shift in Italian politics, binding us together against a common foe. While old rivalries linger, the growing Austrian menace demands unity for the future of the peninsula."

risorgimento.656.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Denies Defensive Pact Offer"
risorgimento.656.d: "The Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont has declined our offer for a defensive pact against Austria.\n\nTheir refusal underscores the deep mistrust and rivalry that persists between our kingdoms. Left isolated, we must reconsider our strategy to counter the growing Austrian influence in Italy."
risorgimento.656.a: "Austria grows stronger, while we grow weaker."
risorgimento.657.t: "The Turin Conference"
risorgimento.657.d: "Delegates from across the Italian peninsula have gathered in Turin to discuss the future of Italy. The conference aims to explore possibilities for unification, cooperation, or continued division among the various states.\n\nFor the [NSC.GetName], these talks represent both an opportunity and a threat. While some see a chance to negotiate favorable terms, others fear losing sovereignty to the ambitions of Piedmont-Sardinia. The coming decisions will shape the destiny of the peninsula for decades to come."
risorgimento.657.a: "Let the conference begin."
risorgimento.658.t: "How Do We Proceed?"
risorgimento.658.d: "With the Turin Conference underway, the [NSC.GetName] faces a crucial decision. Should we pursue closer cooperation with other Italian states, risking our independence for the promise of unification? Or should we resist the growing influence of Piedmont and safeguard our sovereignty at all costs?\n\nThe choices made now will define our future, whether as a leading Italian power or a fading country caught in the tide of change. How shall we proceed?"
risorgimento.658.a: "Do what’s best for our country."
risorgimento.658.b: "Try to find middleground."
risorgimento.658.c: "Subvert [NSC.GetLeader]'s Authority"
risorgimento.659.t: "Going Our Seperate Ways"
risorgimento.659.d: "The Turin Conference has ended without agreement. We have decided to reject the push for unification under Piedmont’s leadership, choosing instead to preserve its independence and pursue its own path.\n\nWhile this stance maintains our sovereignty, it risks isolating us from the growing Italian movement and may invite further tensions with our neighbors. The future remains uncertain as we go our separate ways."
risorgimento.659.a: "We stand firm on our independence."
risorgimento.660.t: "Talking to [NSC.GetLeader]"
risorgimento.660.d: "The question now turns to our future strategy: should we push for a confederation of Italian states that balances cooperation with autonomy, or focus solely on securing full Neapolitan independence and self-governance?\n\nBoth paths carry risks and opportunities. A confederation may strengthen our position against foreign influence but risks diluting our sovereignty. Meanwhile, insisting on autonomy may preserve our traditions but could isolate us politically.\n\nHow shall we proceed?"
risorgimento.660.a: "Advocate for Neapolitan autonomy."
risorgimento.660.b: "Push for an Italian confederation."
risorgimento.661.t: "Two Sicilies Seeks ‘Neapolitan Autonomy’"
risorgimento.661.d: "The [NSC.GetName] has expressed its desire to pursue ‘Neapolitan Autonomy’ within a united Italy, seeking greater self-governance while remaining part of the Italian peninsula.\n\nThis proposal challenges our vision of a centralized Italian state under Piedmontese leadership, raising questions about how much autonomy can be granted without weakening unification efforts. How should we respond to their demands?"
risorgimento.661.a: "Agree to their proposal."
risorgimento.661.b: "Reject their offer."
risorgimento.662.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Grants Us Autonomy"
risorgimento.662.d: "The Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont has agreed to grant us a measure of ‘Neapolitan Autonomy’ within the framework of a united Italy.\n\nWhile this does not amount to full independence, it recognizes our unique identity and grants us some control over local affairs. This compromise may help ease tensions and foster cooperation in the ongoing process of Italian unification."
risorgimento.662.a: "They made the right decision."
risorgimento.663.t: "Two Sicilies Advocates for an Italian Confederation"
risorgimento.663.d: "The [NSC.GetName] is actively pushing for the creation of a confederation of Italian states, seeking to preserve greater regional autonomy and resist full centralization under Sardinia-Piedmont.\n\nThis proposal complicates efforts to unify Italy under a strong centralized government but reflects legitimate concerns over preserving local traditions and governance. Negotiations will be crucial to find common ground."
risorgimento.663.a: "This could work to our advantage."
risorgimento.663.b: "We shall take the lead alone."
risorgimento.664.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Agrees to Confederation"
risorgimento.664.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont has agreed to the formation of a confederation of Italian states, granting the [NSC.GetName] significant autonomy within a unified framework.\n\nThis agreement offers hope for a peaceful path toward Italian unity while respecting the distinct identities and interests of each member state. The future of Italy may yet be one of cooperation rather than conflict."
risorgimento.664.a: "We shall rule as equals."
risorgimento.665.t: "Transporting of Our Political Prisoners"
risorgimento.665.d: "In a bid to reduce internal tensions and ease diplomatic pressure, the government has proposed transferring select political prisoners to exile in France and the United Kingdom.\n\nParis and London, both critical of our domestic repression, have quietly agreed to receive these individuals, most of whom are liberal intellectuals and former revolutionaries. While this move may improve foreign relations, it risks allowing enemies of the crown to reorganize abroad."
risorgimento.665.a: "Approve the transfer, let them be someone else’s problem."
risorgimento.666.t: "Two Sicilies Release Political Prisoners from Prison"
risorgimento.666.d: "The [NSC.GetName] has released a number of political prisoners into exile in Britain and France. This unexpected act of clemency signals a potential shift toward reconciliation and cooperation with our governments.\n\nWhile there is caution about the possible activities of these exiles, their arrival is seen as a positive step in easing tensions and improving diplomatic relations with the Two Sicilies."
risorgimento.666.a: "Welcome the exiles and offer support."
risorgimento.667.t: "The Expedition of the Thousand"
risorgimento.667.d: "A daring expedition led by Giuseppe Garibaldi, known as the Expedition of the Thousand, has landed on our southern shores, threatening the stability of the [NSC.GetName].\n\nThis volunteer force aims to overthrow our rule and unite Italy under a single banner. The local population’s reaction is mixed, some sympathize with the cause, while others remain loyal to the crown. How we respond will shape the future of our nation and its place in the Italian peninsula."
risorgimento.667.a: "Mobilize our forces and strengthen defenses."
risorgimento.668.t: "Passing the Constitution"
risorgimento.668.d: "After much debate and struggle, the [NSC.GetName] has finally passed a new constitution.\n\nThis historic document seeks to balance royal authority with emerging demands for representation and civil rights. While it promises greater political participation, tensions remain between liberals eager for reform and conservatives determined to preserve tradition. The kingdom stands at a critical crossroads, with the future of governance now more uncertain than ever."
risorgimento.668.a: "We did what was best for the nation."
risorgimento.668.b: "Let's rather not instead"
risorgimento.669.t: "Ensuring Loyalty in the Army"
risorgimento.669.d: "With political unrest spreading, securing the loyalty of our army is more crucial than ever.\n\nWe must decide how best to reward our soldiers and officers to ensure their unwavering support during these turbulent times.\n\nOne option is to grant land to key military leaders, binding their fortunes to the kingdom’s stability.\n\nAnother is to provide substantial monetary bonuses to boost morale and dedication.\n\nAlternatively, we could offer both land and money, demonstrating our full commitment to their loyalty and service."
risorgimento.669.a: "Gain their loyalty with monetary rewards."
risorgimento.669.b: "Granting them land is the key."
risorgimento.669.c: "Provide them with both."
risorgimento.670.t: "Failed to Secure the Army's Loyalty"
risorgimento.670.d: "Despite our efforts, the army’s loyalty remains uncertain.\n\nDiscontent among the ranks is growing, fueled by fears of political instability and unmet promises.\n\nThis failure to secure the support of our military leaves the kingdom vulnerable to internal dissent and external threats.\n\nUrgent measures must be taken to restore confidence before unrest spreads further."
risorgimento.670.a: "What a tragic development."
risorgimento.671.t: "Loyalty Through Money"
risorgimento.671.d: "The decision has been made to secure the army’s loyalty through financial incentives.\n\nGenerous bonuses and increased pay will be granted to officers and soldiers alike, aiming to strengthen their commitment to the crown.\n\nWhile this strategy may buy temporary allegiance, the long-term effects on the kingdom’s finances remain uncertain.\n\nStill, the immediate need to maintain order justifies this costly approach."
risorgimento.671.a: "It was the right choice."
risorgimento.672.t: "Loyalty Through Land"
risorgimento.672.d: "To secure the loyalty of the army, we have chosen to grant land to deserving officers and soldiers.\n\nBy providing them with property and estates, we aim to bind their interests to the stability and prosperity of the kingdom.\n\nThis policy not only rewards service but also encourages a deeper investment in the future of the Two Sicilies.\n\nHowever, distributing land must be handled carefully to avoid unrest among the rural population."
risorgimento.672.a: "The army has regained its loyalty."
risorgimento.673.t: "Loyalty Through Land and Wealth"
risorgimento.673.d: "To ensure the unwavering loyalty of our army, we have decided to offer both land and monetary rewards to our officers and soldiers.\n\nThis dual approach aims to secure their commitment by providing tangible wealth alongside a lasting stake in the kingdom’s future.\n\nBy combining financial incentives with land grants, we hope to strengthen bonds of allegiance and maintain stability within the armed forces.\n\nSuch a comprehensive policy underscores our dedication to preserving order during these uncertain times."
risorgimento.673.a: "It has been a costly endeavor, but it was worth it."
risorgimento.674.t: "State of the Bourbon Fleet"
risorgimento.674.d: "The Bourbon fleet remains one of the largest in the Italian peninsula, a symbol of royal strength and naval ambition.\n\nHowever, behind its imposing appearance lie serious concerns. Many ships are aging, maintenance is inconsistent, and morale among sailors has begun to slip. While the fleet can still project power in the Mediterranean, modernization is urgently needed if it is to remain a credible force.\n\nWe must decide whether to invest in restoring its prestige, or risk falling behind our rivals at sea."
risorgimento.674.a: "We shall improve their situation."
risorgimento.675.t: "Two Sicilies Requests Assistance"
risorgimento.675.d: "The [NSC.GetName] has sent word to Vienna, requesting our support in the face of rising unrest and external pressure from unification movements.\n\nTheir appeal is framed as a call for solidarity among conservative monarchies, but behind it lies deepening instability and fear of collapse. We must decide whether to lend our aid and risk deeper entanglement in Italian affairs, or stand aside and let Naples face its fate alone."
risorgimento.675.a: "Send support, we must stand together against nationalists."
risorgimento.675.b: "Refuse, we must avoid unnecessary entanglements."
risorgimento.676.t: "Austria Refuses to Assist Us"
risorgimento.676.d: "Our appeal to the Austrian Empire for aid has been rejected. Despite our shared values and mutual interest in preserving order, Vienna has chosen to remain on the sidelines.\n\nThis refusal is a blow to our diplomatic standing and a stark reminder that we may be left to face our enemies alone. Without Austrian support, our position in the Italian peninsula has grown more precarious, and time may not be on our side."
risorgimento.676.a: "We must stand on our own."
risorgimento.677.t: "Austria Grants Us Assistance"
risorgimento.677.d: "The Austrian Empire has answered our request and agreed to provide assistance. Whether through military advisors, financial aid, or diplomatic backing, Vienna has signaled its commitment to preserving stability in the [NSC.GetName].\n\nThis support strengthens our position at a critical time, bolstering confidence at home and sending a clear message to those who would threaten the existing order in Italy."
risorgimento.677.a: "Their aid secures our position, at least for now."
risorgimento.678.t: "France's Stance on Garibaldi's Expedition?"
risorgimento.678.d: "As Garibaldi and his Thousand press deeper into our territory, the position of France remains dangerously unclear.\n\nThough [FRA.GetLeader] has voiced support for Italian order in the past, whispers in diplomatic circles suggest he may quietly sympathize with the cause of unification. His silence now raises troubling questions, will France stand with us, remain neutral, or covertly aid our enemies?\n\nThe fate of the kingdom may depend on the answer."
risorgimento.678.a: "Send envoys to Paris, we must know where they stand."
risorgimento.679.t: "Delegation from the Two Sicilies Arrives"
risorgimento.679.d: "A formal delegation from the [NSC.GetName] has arrived in Paris, urgently requesting French support against Garibaldi’s ongoing expedition in the south.\n\nThey appeal to our shared interest in preserving order in Italy and preventing a revolutionary upheaval that could destabilize the region. Now, France must decide whether to stand with the old regimes—or remain silent as the unifiers march forward."
risorgimento.679.a: "Support the Two Sicilies, we must preserve the balance."
risorgimento.679.b: "Remain neutral, this is not our fight."
risorgimento.680.t: "France Stands By Us"
risorgimento.680.d: "In a reassuring turn of events, France has chosen to support the [NSC.GetName] against Garibaldi’s Expedition of the Thousand.\n\n[FRA.GetLeader] has made it clear, he will not tolerate revolutionary adventurism that threatens the balance of power in Italy. French diplomats have condemned the incursion and pledged to respect our sovereignty. With Paris standing beside us, we may yet hold the line against unification by force."
risorgimento.680.a: "A welcome alliance, together we will defend the old order."
risorgimento.681.t: "France Supports Garibaldi"
risorgimento.681.d: "Reports confirm our worst fears, France has chosen to lend its support, however discreetly, to Garibaldi and his Expedition of the Thousand.\n\nWhether through quiet diplomatic encouragement or covert material aid, it is now clear that Paris sympathizes with the cause of Italian unification. This development drastically alters the balance of power and may embolden Garibaldi’s forces as they continue their advance into our lands."
risorgimento.681.a: "We must prepare for the worst, France cannot be trusted."
risorgimento.682.t: "Economy of the Two Sicilies"
risorgimento.682.d: "The economy of the [NSC.GetName] remains a complex blend of agriculture, artisanal crafts, and nascent industry.\n\nFertile southern lands produce wheat, olives, citrus fruits, and wine, sustaining a largely rural population reliant on traditional farming and dominated by large estates. Meanwhile, urban centers like Naples and Palermo drive early industrialization, boasting advanced shipbuilding, textile mills, ironworks, and armament factories.\n\nInfrastructure improvements such as railways and telegraph lines signal progress, highlighted by the Naples–Portici railway, Italy’s first. Financial institutions concentrate in cities, supporting domestic and limited international trade. Yet, stark economic disparities persist, with industrial growth centered near Naples while much of the south remains trapped in feudal structures limiting social and economic mobility."
risorgimento.682.a: "We shall modernize."
risorgimento.683.t: "The Consigli Edilizi"
risorgimento.683.d: "The Consigli Edilizi, local advisory councils established throughout the [NSC.GetName], continue to play a vital role in managing regional affairs.\n\nComprised mainly of landowners, merchants, and local notables, these councils advise the government on matters of taxation, infrastructure, and public order. While intended to improve governance and maintain stability, their conservative composition often resists progressive reforms and preserves the influence of traditional elites.\n\nNevertheless, the Consigli Edilizi remain an important link between the central government and local communities, helping to maintain the fragile balance within our diverse kingdom."
risorgimento.683.a: "Modernization is in progress."
risorgimento.684.t: "The Fonderia Ferdinandea"
risorgimento.684.d: "The Fonderia Ferdinandea, one of the Kingdom’s most important foundries, continues to be a pillar of our industrial progress.\n\nLocated near Naples, it specializes in the production of heavy machinery, ironworks, and armaments, supporting both civilian industries and our military’s modernization efforts. Its skilled workforce and advanced technology symbolize the kingdom’s commitment to industrial growth despite many challenges.\n\nStrengthening institutions like the Fonderia Ferdinandea is essential if we hope to compete with the great powers and secure our place in Italy’s future."

risorgimento.685.t: "Officine di Pietrarsa"
risorgimento.685.d: "The Officine di Pietrarsa remains a flagship of the Kingdom’s industrial ambitions.\n\nEstablished near Naples, this vast complex manufactures locomotives, railway equipment, and steam engines, fueling the expansion of our rail network and industrial infrastructure. It stands as one of the most advanced factories in Italy, symbolizing progress and modernization.\n\nMaintaining and expanding Pietrarsa’s capabilities is vital to our economic development and military readiness in the face of growing regional tensions."
risorgimento.685.a: "Truly interesting news."
risorgimento.686.t: "Banco di Napoli"
risorgimento.686.d: "The Banco di Napoli remains one of the oldest and most influential financial institutions in the Kingdom.\n\nServing as a cornerstone for trade and commerce, it supports both local industries and international transactions. Its presence strengthens the kingdom’s economic stability and provides vital credit for infrastructure projects and industrial ventures.\n\nAs we navigate uncertain times, the role of Banco di Napoli in financing progress and maintaining fiscal order becomes ever more crucial."
risorgimento.686.a: "Backbone of our financial stability."
risorgimento.687.t: "Increasing Funding for the Navy"
risorgimento.687.d: "With growing tensions across the Italian peninsula and foreign powers asserting themselves in the Mediterranean, the Kingdom has approved increased funding for the Real Marina.\n\nResources will be directed toward modernizing our fleet, expanding shipbuilding at the port of Naples, and training new officers. A stronger navy will not only defend our coasts but also assert our influence in southern waters and protect vital trade routes."
risorgimento.687.a: "They are to become the backbone of our army!"
risorgimento.688.t: "Maritime Societies"
risorgimento.688.d: "Across the Kingdom, maritime Societies and academies have begun to play an increasingly important role in shaping maritime doctrine and training future officers.\n\nSupported by the crown and prominent merchants, these institutions promote innovation in naval tactics, engineering, and navigation. Their work strengthens the Real Marina and fosters a spirit of professionalism and pride within our growing fleet."
risorgimento.688.a: "Our navy grows stronger by the day."
risorgimento.689.t: "Thomas Richard Guppy's Proposal"
risorgimento.689.d: "British engineer Thomas Richard Guppy, known for his pioneering work in steamship technology, has approached our government with a proposal to invest in his latest innovations.\n\nHaving already contributed to the design of the King of Naples steamship, Guppy now offers to collaborate further in advancing our naval engineering and industrial capacity. Supporting his work could place the Kingdom at the forefront of Mediterranean naval development, but it will require resources and political will."
risorgimento.689.a: "Support Guppy’s innovation — progress requires boldness."
risorgimento.689.b: "Turn it down, we can’t afford to waste money on nonsense."
risorgimento.690.t: "Future Industrial Plans"
risorgimento.690.d: "As the pace of modernization accelerates across Europe, the [NSC.GetName] must look ahead to secure its industrial future.\n\nGovernment officials and royal advisors have begun drafting plans to expand railways, modernize factories, and invest in key sectors such as metallurgy, shipbuilding, and textiles. While challenges remain, especially in rural regions, these plans may lay the foundation for a stronger, self-sufficient economy capable of competing with northern powers."
risorgimento.690.a: "Day by day, the wheels of progress thunder forward."
risorgimento.691.t: "State of Our Navy"
risorgimento.691.d: "Our fleet remains a point of both pride and concern. While the [NSC.GetName] boasts modern warships and skilled crews, years of inconsistent funding and political distractions have left parts of the navy in need of repair and modernization. The question now is whether we will invest in restoring our maritime strength or let it gradually decline."
risorgimento.691.a: "We have a lot to work on."
risorgimento.692.t: "Discontent in the Navy"
risorgimento.692.d: "Reports have reached the court of growing unrest among the officers and sailors of the Real Marina. Many feel underfunded, overlooked, and frustrated by slow modernization efforts.\n\nMorale is slipping as rumors of poor conditions and outdated equipment circulate. If left unchecked, this discontent could undermine naval readiness and loyalty."
risorgimento.692.a: "This is not looking good ..."
risorgimento.693.t: "Filiangeri’s Failed Negotiations"

risorgimento.694.t: "Two Sicilies Requests French Protection"
risorgimento.694.d: "Amid growing instability and the potential advance of nationalist volunteers, the [NSC.GetName] has formally appealed to us for protection.\n\nThey frame their request as a defence of legitimate state and regional order, hoping to secure our support against revolutionary forces and foreign ambitions. Accepting their plea could reinforce our influence in Italy, but it also risks entangling us in a widening conflict."

risorgimento.695.t: "France Extends Its Protection"

risorgimento.695.a: "We will survive."
risorgimento.696.t: "France Denies Our Plea for Protection"
risorgimento.696.d: "Despite our urgent appeal amidst rising threats, France has decided not to extend its protection to the [NSC.GetName].\n\nThis refusal leaves us vulnerable to internal unrest and external ambitions, forcing us to reconsider our strategies in safeguarding the realm’s future."
risorgimento.696.a: "Without their guarantees, we are powerless."
risorgimento.697.t: "Sardinian-Piedmontese Ultimatum"
risorgimento.697.d: "Following their decisive victory in the Second War of Independence, Sardinia-Piedmont has turned its gaze southward. An ultimatum now sits before our court: accept peaceful unification under their rule or face the full force of their armies. The ministers and generals of the [NSC.GetName] are bitterly divided. Some believe our military can still repel the northern aggressor and preserve our sovereignty, while others warn that defiance would invite ruin and needless bloodshed. The choice will determine whether our flag continues to fly or becomes part of a united Italy."
risorgimento.697.a: "We Will Obey Them."
risorgimento.697.b: "Face The Consequences!"
risorgimento.698.t: "The Basilicata Earthquake"
risorgimento.698.d: "At approximately 10:15 in the evening, a powerful earthquake struck the Basilicata region.

The Murattiani agitate for a progressive, constitutional Italy, one united not by conquest, but by ideals.

NSC_vic_idea_Sulphur_UK_desc: "In 1840, our kingdom gave a monopoly on sulfur to a French firm. The British believed it violated the trade agreement of 1816. §RThis hurt our relations greatly which will not allow us to later pursue relations with them.§!

## Leaders ##
POLITICS_FERDINANDO_II_DESC: "Since ascending the throne in 1830, King Ferdinando II rules the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies with an iron hand. He fiercely protects his realm’s independence, modernizing the army and navy while crushing revolutionary movements with uncompromising force. To his supporters, he is a defender of tradition and order; to his enemies, a reactionary tyrant. As Italy’s political climate grows restless and foreign powers eye the peninsula, Ferdinando stands determined to keep the Bourbon crown secure — whatever the cost."
POLITICS_FRANCESCO_II_DESC: "Young and untested, Francesco II takes the throne after the death of his father Ferdinando II. Deeply religious and personally modest, he prefers prayer and counsel to the intrigues of politics. Surrounded by conservative advisors and burdened by growing unrest, he struggles to assert his authority as Italy’s unification movement gathers momentum. His inexperience and indecision risk leaving the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies vulnerable in a time of great upheaval."
POLITICS_ALFONSO_I_DESC: "Raised under the close guidance of Queen Maria Teresa, Alfonso I takes the throne as his mother’s trusted instrument. Charismatic yet ambitious, he presents himself as a modernizer ready to strengthen the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, but his reign rests heavily on the influence of the queen mother.

Imprisoned for his beliefs in the past, he now seeks to transform the country into a freer and more just state.

Known for his discipline and pragmatism, he seeks to balance tradition with the demands of a modern constitutional state. Filangieri’s military reputation lends him authority, but guiding the nation through reform while preserving stability will test both his political skill and his resolve."
