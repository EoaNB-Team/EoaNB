 # Kokera 1858
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.1.t: "The Tokugawa Shogunate"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.1.d_shogunate: "Ever since Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Japan has undergone an era of unprecedented unity, progress, and stability under his descendants' reign. This era, dubbed the Edo Period after the newly designated capital along the eastern seaboard, would be the beginning of Japan's complete withdrawal from the outside world, save for brief contacts with China and Korea. Under this strong stance of 'Sakoku' or isolation, Japan was able to resist the spread of Christianity and the overall encroachment of Western influences that were common throughout the rest of East Asia during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, only admitting an exception for the mercantile Dutch, who respected Japan's resolution to seclusion.\n \nThe times are changing for the Shogunate and the Bakufu Council that rules over Japan. The Pax Orientalis, or great peace of the east, is faltering as the Indies fall to western encroachment and the rule of the Great Qing weakens. Even worse, dignitaries from the United States, armed with a wrought iron fleet and giant cannons, demand the end of Japan's long-achieved independence and will burn Edo to the ground if necessary.\n \nIn a world increasingly shrinking, Japan must prepare to meet the challenge of a world ever alienating her interests, but internal factions are split on how she should face them. The Imperial House, which has long retreated from administration, demands that we not lose face and rush to meet the West with swords, but the Bakufu Council contends that Japan is not yet ready to meet a world that has advanced so quickly. Even worse, Shogun Iesada, the head of the state, is sickly and unconfident, weakening the morale and decisiveness of Japan and her people. With discontent growing and our days of negotiating dwindling, the Tokugawa shogunate may face its day of reckoning..."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.1.a: "For whom does the wind blow?"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.2.t: "Return of the Kokera?"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.2.d: "Two decades ago, the Kokera (Cholera) Disease entered our lands from the lands of India upon British merchant ships. While the disease has remained quiet since an initial epidemic in the late 1820s, Kyushu officials in recent reports have written of a similar sickness spreading among the peasants.\n \nThese reports come during at an inauspicious time, as our Bakufu Council looks to negotiate the next round of treaties with the Western Powers. Some of our elders warn that this plague is an effect of evil spirits purposely brought to Japan by the West while others believe it is Japan's spirits punishment on Kyushu's love for Western teachings. Either way, the Kokera of years past had brought much strife and sorrow to the peoples of Japan and the Tokugawan Shōgun is not anxious for another catastrophy during this time of crisis."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.2.a: "It is a sign!"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.2.b: "Troubling times brew ahead."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.3.t: "Scourge spreads in Nagasaki"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.3.d: "As we have feared, a messenger from Nagasaki has brought news that an outbreak of the Kokera curse has swept Nagasaki. As many flee from the southern port, some Han Lords of the surrounding countryside have resorted to instruct their samurai to kill any refugees fleeing the in fear of the spreading curse.\n \nIt is important to contain this threat from spreading any further, but Nagasaki, one of Japan's few ports to the outside world is expected to remain open by treaties with the Western Powers. Closing and quarantining the port may also bring unexpected wrath from the West, poorly-timed as negotiations of more permanent trade treaties are still proceeding in Edo."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.3.a: "Quarantine Nagasaki."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.3.b: "Keep the Port Open!"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.3.c: "Call for the Bakufu to reinforce the quarantine!"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.4.t: "[TSH.GetNameDef] Closes Nagasaki"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.4.d: "The Japanese have closed the port of Nagasaki, breaking the agreed terms that our people under Perry had reached!\n \nNagasaki is an essential port that secures our interests in East Asia and it is to benefit that the port remains open, no matter Japanese interests."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.4.a: "Demand they reopen the port!"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.4.b: "Wait it out. Best be safe."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.5.t: "[USA.GetNameDef] Demands We Open Nagasaki"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.5.d: "The Americans have demanded we open the port, despite the ongoing plague that has begun to ravage Kyushu. Reopening the port may only worsen the plague that had undoubted been introduced by the foreigners, but simply dismissing the Americans' demands may incur their wrath."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.5.a: "Reopen Nagasaki"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.5.b: "Keep Nagasaki closed. They'll understand."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.6.t: "Death Spreads in Nagasaki"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.6.d: "The Kokera curse has continued to hold Nagasaki hostage this past month. While estimates are unknown, our messengers report the crematoriums in Nagasaki are littered with the bodies of the dead, and no end to the plague in sight."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.6.a: "Let us hope the rest of Japan avoids this fate."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.7.t: "Kokera in Satsuma"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.7.d: "The Kokera has spread to the Satsuma Domain! "
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.7.a: "The Westerners brought this upon us!"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.7.a: "The Bakufu need not know our weakness!"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.7.c: "We should send aid."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.7.e: "The Tozama can handle it themselves."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.8.t: "Tokugawa Bakufu sends aid"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.8.d: "The Bakufu Council has decided to grace us with additions supplies of medical herbs and stores of grain. These will hopefully aid in our efforts against the plague."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.8.a: "An unexpected course."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.8.b: "A likely bribe."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.9.t: "Kokera along Kaidos"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.9.d: "Japan is of trade, commerce and communication and has for centuries been heavily reliant on the intra-national roads and shipping routes to connect her centers of culture. The Kaidos, or Great Highways, however have been a center of the spread of the plague and it is expected travelers along these roads are now bringing the disease northward from Kyushu"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.9.a: "We must do something about it!"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.9.b: "It is beyond our control."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.10.t: "Kokera in Edo"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.10.d: "The dangers we have worried over has come true. Reports of the Kokera plague have been confirmed along the South and coastal neighborhoods of our capital Edo. Edo is our center of learning and politics, and the plague is now not only killing many, but undermining the frail image of the Bakufu Council's ability to handle Japan's crises in its backyard.\n \nThere is great worry that the plague will cause greater unrest amongst the populace and that the Bakufu Elders could get infected as well. We should look to isolate or evacuate the elders from the central city."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.10.a: "Evacuate Bakufu Authorities"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.13.t: "Kokera in [FROM.GetName]"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.13.d: "We have reports that the Kokera plague is in [FROM.GetName], heavily affecting the people and towns of the region."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.13.a: "The curse continues"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.14.t: "Edo Festival"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.14.d: "It has been a long-witnessed tradition that the nature spirits that bring about plagues only do so because of the failures of men and the wrath of the gods. We should look to hold a festival to appease the spirits."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.14.a: "Splendid! This shall ward off the curse!"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.15.t: "Kokera Curse Improves"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.15.d: "The Curse of the Kokera has seemed to stall and weaken through the streets of Edo."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.15.a: "Good"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.16.t: "Kokera Curse Worsens"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.16.d: "The Curse of the Kokera has seemed to worsen and continued to spread amok in the streets of Edo."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.16.a: "Was our festival not grand enough?"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.17.t: "Distrust with Bakufu Authority"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.17.d: "The political esteem of the Bakufu Council and the Tokugawa Shogunate as a whole has waned in the past dozen seasons. It has become clear with the latest plague, ailing economy and weakening prowess of Shogunate authority that the Bakufu Council and [TSH.GetLeader] may not be up to the task on governing Japan."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.17.a: "Times may only worsen from here"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.18.t: "Byogaku Tsuron"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.18.d: "The 'Byogaku Tsuron' or Introduction to Pathology, was Edo Japan's first widespread introduction to modern medical practices. A compilation of Dutch works slowly introduced by traders through the Rangaku Era, Japanese pioneer scientist Ogata Koan worked tirelessly to translate hundreds of western literature works in hopes of bringing new understandings to Japan. While his works have been often mostly ignored or overlooked in decades past, it has been noticed medical practitioners that follow practices from the Byogaku Tsuron have succeeded in better maintaining the health of their patients."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.18.a: "We should consider recommending it to our elders"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.19.t: "Decline of Kokera Curse"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.19.d: "After several years of the Kokera curse ravaging, it has seemed that reports of the sickness have finally declined to a tolerable level."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.19.a: "We can now focus on other pressing matters"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.20.t: "Arrival of the Kanrin Maru"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.20.d: "After 4 years of its original purchase, the Kanrin Maru has finally arrived from the dockyards of Holland to serve in the our new Kaigun! She has arrived with a crew of expert Dutch sailors and scientists and offer a bountiful investment of knowledge that could be used to expand the wisdom of our elders."
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.20.a: "Lovely!"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.20.a_tt: "Unlock National Focus §CInvite van Meerdervoort§!"
  TSH_van_meerdervoort_arrive_flag: "Kanrin Maru has arrived"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.21.t: "Meerdervoort Pushes Opening Western-Based Hospital"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.21.d: "Western Advisor Johannes Pompe van Meerdervoort has requested funding for construction and maintenence of a western-based medical center. He argues that traditional medical practices are not enough and that having a place to show Japanese doctors new ways to treat their patients could go a long way to revolutionizing Japan's society."

  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.71.d: "After centuries of near-complete isolation of Japan from the world stage has allowed Japan's politics, reforms and economies to remain unaffected by the changes of global norms. One of which, was the great inflation of silver supplies introduced by the european colonization of the Americas during seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While empires across the global from Britain, Spain, the Ottomans and even the Qing succumbed to decades of silver inflation, the Japanese until now had remained undisturbed by increased global supplies of silver.\n \nThe recent developments of the Amity Treaties, a collection of trade treaties forcing Japan to open its economy and market to a select Western Powers, has finally forced Japan to confront a world greatly changed since it first isolated itself 400 years ago. It's age-old exchange rate of 5 Silver to 1 Gold, is outdated and in the eyes of governments and merchants abroad alike, a good deal, as global standards currently place the exchange rate at 11 SIlver for 1 Gold. Now merchants from all over are flocking to Japan — if allowed — seeking to buy up Japanese gold while it is steal cheap!"

  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.73.d: "The market reforms we have pursued in the past months to alleviate the current Gold Crisis has exposed several other underlying issues with the structure of our national economy that our elders argue could be ripe for exploitation. One of the most prevalent is Japan's lack of a unified currency. A practice never revoked since the feudal ages of the first shogunate near a millennia ago, the Han Domains have always retained their autonomy to establish local-backed currencies. While this system has remain useful and preserving amicability with far flung daimyo clans during our years of isolation, the inform exchange rates of dozens of currencies combined with the weakening of Japan's Gold supply could lead to many domains unexpectedly bankrupt if foreign banks notice these flaws.\n \nThe elders in charge of market reforms propose the Shogunate introduce a more nationalized currency, and ask our daimyos to start switching to it. While this reform will move our economy closer to stability, this may also hurt local economies in the short term, weakening the trust we've build with the Domains and the evident risk of introducing a new currency, that is not backed with huge stocks of Gold, could also incur its own types of reprecussions...."

 JAP_imperial.1.t: "Deciding our Monetary System"
 JAP_imperial.1.d: "Under the leadership of the government, merchants introduced the kawase-kaisha, prototypes of western commercial banks. In 1871, Kiyonari Yoshida, a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official who has recently returned from a long stint in Europe and the United States, proposed a plan for the establishment of a single issuing bank modeled after the Bank of England. Saying the structure of the current Japanese economy stands similair to that of Britain. In 1871, the government declared that it would adopt the gold standard and introduce the yen as the new unit of account. Hirobumi Ito, a high-ranking official in the MOF, argued that if we introduce the U.S. system, we will be able to redeem half of the existing currency into banknotes and convert the other half into government bonds. His reasoning was based on the structure of the Japanese economy, which was decentralized at the time and more closely resembled the economy of the United States than the economies of Europe. Yoshida argued that we should introduce the common method of banknote issuance in Europe by establishing an issuing company with specie reserves. A sharp debate arose over the two competing plans for the new issuing bank system.' In his argument, Ito argued that 'if we introduce the U.S. system, we will be able to redeem half of the existing currency into banknotes issued by the newly established issuing companies and convert the other half into government bonds.' In doing so, he argued, 'we will recover the credibility of the currency.' Yoshida responded, 'We should introduce the common method of banknote issuance in Europe by establishing an issuing company with specie reserves. By doing so, we will eventually be able to make coins and paper money convertible.'\nWhat shall it be?"

This system, which has been in place on these isles since the beginning of the reign of the Shogun nearly 265 years ago, has been nothing but bastardly corruption and ineffective results. This was the way of feudalism and the old, but the new imperial polity promised a new change—an effective change."

 JAP_imperial.3.d: "Mission Iwakura will be a Japanese diplomatic expedition across the world between 1871 and 1873, with stops scheduled in the United States and Europe. It will be led by leading and voluntary Meiji era statesmen and intellectuals. Many prior Shogunate missions, such as the Japanese Embassy to the United States in 1860, the First Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1862, and the Second Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1863, preceded the Iwakura mission.\n \nThe mission's three objectives are to seek recognition for Emperor Meiji's newly restored imperial dynasty, to begin preliminary renegotiation of unequal treaties with leading international countries, and to conduct a complete study of modern economic, political, military affairs, and educational systems and structures in the United States and Europe."

 JAP_imperial.5.t: "Imperial Japan"
 JAP_imperial.5.d: "Chapter I: Our History.\n \nFor two thousand years, House Yamato has reigned as the Emperors of Japan and its dominions, creating peace and prosperity under their rule. Our divine rule was given to us by Jinmu-tennō, or Emperor Jimmu, the son of Ugayafukiaezu and Konohana-Sakuya-hime, daughter of the dragon god, Ryjin. He is considered to be a direct descendant of Amaterasu, the noble goddess of the sun. Jimmu's narrative is linked to the stories of the Ōtomo clan, and its purpose of establishing clan ties to the royal line. With the help of local leader Sao Netsuhiko and Jimmu's older brother, Itsuse no Mikoto, they headed eastward via the Seto Inland Sea. According to the Kojiki, Jimmu died at the age of 126, and his posthumous moniker signifies divine power.\n \nChapter II: The Shōguns Dwindling Control.\n \nBut, ever since our rule was thwarted and usurped by the first Tokugawa ruler, Shōgun Ieyasu, the House of Yamato has been kept in silence and withheld all power. For more than 200 years, Japan has been kept in withdrawal from the outside world, but the tides have turned. Edo's shores were dotted with Western gunboats that had appeared on the shores of Edo, demanding the end of our isolation or facing utter consequences. This had broken the already collapsing Tokugawa control, and it was deemed time for a planned and well-ordered restoration, the Restoration of the Emperor Meiji:\n \nChapter III: The Restoration of the Emperor.\n \nThe collapse of Japan's Tokugawa shogunate and the restoration of direct imperial power marked the start of the Meiji Restoration. The shogunate's isolationist strategy was challenged in the nineteenth century by Russia, Britain, and the United States, making Japanese feudal elites aware of Japan's susceptibility to superior Western weaponry. Following Commodore Matthew Perry's visit, Japan was obliged to sign a series of unequal treaties that, like China, granted Western powers unique advantages in Japan. Young samurai from feudal lands that had been traditionally antagonistic to the Tokugawa system rose up against the government in retaliation. They declared the Emperor's return to power in January 1868, and the final Tokugawa soldiers surrendered in May 1869, after much intense battle. The revolutionaries have urged the Emperor to issue the Charter Oath, which promises a break between the feudal class restrictions of the past and a search for knowledge that could transform Japan into a modernized, thriving country, featuring a bolstering economy and a Western army. The restoration ushered in the Meiji period, a time of rapid modernization and Westernization."
 JAP_imperial.5.a: "A New Sun Rises in the East"
 JAP_imperial.6.t: "The Question of the Han System"
 JAP_imperial.6.d: "For hundreds of years, the Han System has allowed smaller, more autonomous daimyō to exist within the main government. At the start of the new Meiji Era, we must centralize and unify Japan. Or at least, that is what the central government is saying, but how will the rest of Japan react to the most drastic change Japan has seen in years?"

 JAP_imperial.7.t: "The Osaka Conference"
 JAP_imperial.7.d1: "\tAfter being pressured by political liberals to adopt a more constitutional form of government, we have decided on a new provisional form of government. From now on the Judicial system will be its own branch of the government and called the Great Court of Cassation (Daishin-in).\n\n\tIn regards to what form a provisional legislature will take we have two choice. Both feature a bicameral system, where the Assembly of Prefectural Governors will serve as the lower house and the Senate (Genroin) will serve as the upper house. However the real difference is how the legislators are selected. The conservatives among us want only those loyal to the Emperor and his goals to serve him and his people, and the only way to ensure that is have all of them be appointed by the Emperor himself from among the most trusted officials and bureaucrats, rather than leaving it to a risky election determined by a mostly illiterate electorate. The rather bothersome liberals want, of course, said election. How are we to proceed?"

Both feature a bicameral system, where the Assembly of Prefectural Governors will serve as the lower house and the Senate (Genroin) will serve as the upper house. However the real difference is how the legislators are selected. Due to our mild political reforms allowing for some autonomy in the domains, we can expect each Daimyo to have different ideas how their representatives to this new legislature are selected, and it is expected that many will allow some form of voting, as a concession to the recently disempowered samurai class if nothing else. On the other hand it could be said that allowing the Daimyos to dictate to us how our power should be used is one step too far back to the days of the Shogun and even the Sengoku Jidai!

 JAP_imperial.9.d: "These Japanese isles have been ruthlessly split and separated into domains and semi-autonomous regions without regard to the prefectures that form the borders between them all. Prefectures themselves are administrative jurisdictions traditionally governed by an appointed prefect, with these borders determined by the central government. The prefectures under the Tokugawa are long overdue for reorganization, and if we are to move past our old ways and into modern light, then a restructuring of the prefectures is in order."

  JAP_imperial.11.d: "Like the Imperial Army Staff took over the Army Ministry, the Navy General Staff took over operational, as opposed to administrative authority, which was left to the Navy Ministry, over the Imperial Japanese Navy from the Navy Ministry. It is to be responsible for the planning and execution of national defense strategy throughout our home islands and overseas territories. Through the Imperial General Headquarters, an overarching body under the supervision of the emperor designed to oversee the naval and army staff offices, it will report directly to the Emperor. It will always be headed by an active admiral headquartered in Tokyo.\n \n "The ministry is responsible for the naval budget, ship construction, weapons procurement, personnel, relations with the Diet and the cabinet, and broad matters of naval policy. The General Staff directs the operations of the fleet and the preparation of war plans.""
  JAP_imperial.11.a: "Glory to the Imperial Navy!"
  JAP_imperial.12.t: "Imperial Japanese Army Staff Office"
  JAP_imperial.12.d: "The Army Ministry was created, along with the Navy Ministry, with the dutiful purpose of replacing the Ministry of Military Affairs (Hybush) of the early Meiji government. Initially, the Army Ministry was in charge of both administrative and operational command of the Imperial Japanese Army. However, with new arrangements being forced through the government, the Imperial Army General Staff Office will be taking over all operational control of the army, leaving the Army Ministry only with administrative functions.\n \nThe Imperial Army General Staff will thus be responsible for the preparation of war plans; the military training and employment of combined arms; military intelligence; the direction of troop maneuvers and troop deployments; and the compilation of field service military regulations, military histories, and cartography.\n \nThe Chief of the Army General Staff will be the senior ranking uniformed officer in the Imperial Japanese Army and will enjoy, along with the War Minister, the Navy Minister, and the Chief of the Navy General Staff, direct access to the Emperor—a privilege not many positions can claim to hold. In wartime, the Imperial Army General Staff forms part of the army section of the Imperial General Headquarters, an ad hoc body under the supervision of the emperor created to assist in coordinating the overall command of both the Imperial Army General Staff and the Imperial Navy General Staff."

There are riots in major cities: Schools teaching the western model are being burned; Government tax buildings, police stations, and factories are all included! We believe this has started because the French conscription law we copied word for word was translated by an incompetent who didn't understand that "Impot du Sang" (Tax of the Blood) wasn't an actual taking of people's blood. Regardless of the causes, instability has brought to the surface every resentment felt by all your subjects. Samurai who have lost their prestige, artisans who have lost their craft, and peasants who have lost their land can no longer claim to be superior to outcasts. Especially enraging was the provision that certain individuals could donate money to the armed forces specifically to shirk their duty.

The crew refuses, and both sides engage in a violent exchange of gunfire. In the chaos, 54 Ryukyuan sailors are killed, and the ship is seized by the Japanese.

The decision of who will ultimately lead the expedition is an important one, and the government is taking every measure to ensure that the best person is selected for the job.

 JAP_imperial.27.d: "The Japanese Expedition to Formosa in 1874 is a historic event that marks Japan's first major foray into the politics and affairs of neighboring Taiwan. The expedition is led by a formidable force of over 3,000 soldiers, who are tasked with the mission of surveying the island's topography and establishing a foothold for Japan. The decision to send this expedition was made in response to several incidents involving Taiwanese aboriginals attacking Japanese fishing vessels, and also as part of Japan's larger strategy of expanding its influence in East Asia. As the expedition sets sail towards Formosa, there is a sense of excitement and anticipation among the Japanese troops, who are eager to showcase their strength and prowess. However, there are also concerns about the challenges that lie ahead, including potential resistance from the indigenous peoples of Formosa and the unpredictable nature of the island's terrain and climate. Despite these challenges, the Japanese Expedition to Formosa represents a bold and decisive step forward in Japan's history and its relationship with its neighbors in the region."

 JAP_imperial.30.t: "Chinese Delegations Refuse to Pay"
 JAP_imperial.30.d: "China's steadfast refusal to pay reparations for the Ryukyan Incident of 1871 is a deeply disappointing and frustrating stance. The incident, marked by the brutal attack on a Japanese diplomatic mission and the subsequent loss of valuable lives, was a grave violation of international norms. Japan had hoped that China would take responsibility for the actions of its citizens and provide reparations as a sign of remorse and commitment to maintaining peaceful relations. China's refusal not only perpetuates the sense of injustice felt by Japan but also hampers the process of reconciliation and trust-building between the two nations. Japan firmly believes that accepting responsibility and paying reparations would pave the way for healing, understanding, and a more stable future relationship between the two countries."
 JAP_imperial.30.a: "Demand a meeting with the emperor's delegate"
 JAP_imperial.31.t: "The Emperors Refusal"
 JAP_imperial.31.d: "The emperor's refusal to pay reparations is a deeply disheartening and perplexing decision. The incident, whether it be the Mudan Incident or the Ryukyan Incident, resulted in significant loss of life and damage to Japan. The demand for reparations is not driven by a desire for vengeance, but rather a pursuit of justice and acknowledgment of the suffering endured. The Emperor's refusal to pay reparations undermines the principles of accountability and fairness, casting doubt on their commitment to maintaining amicable relations. Japan had hoped for a resolution that would bring closure and promote healing, but the emperor's stance prolongs the pain and disappointment felt by the Japanese people, leaving the path towards genuine reconciliation uncertain and fraught with tension."

The outcome to this decision shall determine the total budget to be given to the military, but we should be wary.

japindustrialrevolution.19.t: "The Battle of Shiroyama"
japindustrialrevolution.19.d: ""The last forty samurai seek to avenge their fallen as they make their final gambit, valiantly charging into combat despite the storm of gunfire that threatens to tear them to shreds. A glorious fight for a terrible cause—these fallen soldiers lay waste on the ground, slaughtered ruthlessly by our Gatling guns... Bushido no hinkaku, samurai no saigo no toride (Bushido dignified; the last stand of the Samurai)"\n \nAt Shiroyama hill, Daimyō Samurai Saigō Takamori made his final stand, a beautiful fight waged by the surviving 500 samurai soldiers, all of whom still committed fealty to their commander and code Bushido. Despite starting with roughly 20,000 samurai, Saigō had lost the majority of his soldiers and vital supplies in a succession of prior losses, most notably at Kumamoto Castle and Tabaruzaka Fields. Rikugun-gensui Yamagata Aritomo, an old friend and fellow revolutionary of Saigō during the Meiji Restoration, was his principal opponent. Yamagata gathered his men, numbering in the tens of thousands, to encircle Shiroyama hill with intricate earthworks, trenches, and barricades, ensuring that no samurai could leave and putting an end to the uprising. The Samurai spent their days in preparation for the Imperial soldiers' onslaught. They spent their time at camp singing songs, writing poetry, and playing games. Yamagata appealed to Saigō for unconditional surrender before their terrible deaths.\n \n"As the leader of young vigorous men of the nation and resisting a great and famous army through many fierce battles, your fame is already well enough known to the world. But now most of your brave generals are dead or injured, and your military power is daily growing weaker. It is already clear that at last your Satsuma army is unable to keep its spirit. I don't know what further things you can hope to achieve, except a hopeless defensive battle. If you, Saigõ, rather than lengthen the rest of your days a little, prefer to cause hundreds and thousands of dead and wounded from both armies, there is nothing that I, Aritomo, can say to you. I beg you to judge for yourself as you hold matters in the palm of your hand, and that you will save both armies from death and injury. Ah, you are a man famous and known in the world. About our national constitution, naturally it is not only Aritomo who knows what you really think. But the matter has been settled over many years of public debate. I, Aritomo, earnestly beg you as your old friend. Writing this my tears fall like rain, and I cannot express myself at all. Please sympathize with the sincerity of my pain.""
japindustrialrevolution.19.a: ""I'm sorry... my friend."
japindustrialrevolution.20.t: "The Story of Shiroyama"
japindustrialrevolution.20.d: "...Saigō, true to the code of Bushido, refused to lay down his katana and surrender. \n \nBefore this rebellion, Saigō would never have thought this would be his way out, as he was a simple teacher of the samurai arts. He was content with the fall of the shôgun and the restoration of the Emperor, fighting many battles for the great cause. The changing winds of Japan and the modernization of the country meant the abolition of the privileged social status of the samurai class and the undermining of their financial position. His students stirred up tension between the new westernized government and the samurai class, indirectly involving Saigō in these actions. These very rapid and prodigious changes to Japanese culture, language, dress, and society appeared to many samurai to be a betrayal of the jōi ("expel the barbarians") portion of the sonnō jōi. With all this forced onto the people of old tradition, tensions boiled and the Satsuma rebellion would begin. \n \n"As the new age begins, the way of the warrior comes to an end; as the new age begins, the ways of old must apprehend." \nAfter a search party found Saigō 's body and head, Yamagata Aritomo was alleged to have been left speechless and motionless, murmuring to himself as he looked wearily. \n \n"As Rikugun-gensui Yamagata Aritomo was delivered the head of Saigō  Takamori after learning of his death from Seppuku, the Imperial army marched among the fallen, troops presenting signs of peace for the murdered samurai into the afterlife. I could see the calm expression on his face as he looked down at his dead friend. Many of the troops remained silent as they watched with respect and dignity as he ordered the head to be washed while holding it in his arms and reciting a tranquil meditation to the fallen warrior.""

japindustrialrevolution.21.t: "Currency Act of 1871"
japindustrialrevolution.21.d: "The Meiji administration formally introduced a new currency in The Currency Act of 1871, or Yen Act of 1871, and chose the term "yen," which means "round item," for our silver dollar currency. Like many other currencies around the world, the yen was essentially a dollar unit, and it, like other dollars, originated from Spanish eights. This new currency has come to replace the old Tokugawa Coinage System, which was bloated and heavily underweighted, unlike what the new system will entail."
japindustrialrevolution.21.a: "A Splendid Proposal"
japindustrialrevolution.22.t: "The Railway Nationalization Act"
japindustrialrevolution.22.d: "Tarō Katsura, Prime Minister and Director of the Meiji Imperial Diet, appears on the beautifully covered marble and concrete stairs of the Kokkai-gijid, or Imperial Diet Building, in Nagatach, Chiyoda, Tokyo. Long and tense sessions wear him down on a daily basis, and neither the House of Representatives nor the House of Councillors can agree on anything no matter the situation. \n \n"I sit and stand, walk and then pace, talk and then yell, but all of my efforts are for naught since they merely dispute small and indecisively. Few out of many acts have passed within months, a staggeringly low number compared to earlier years. I don't think I'll be able to calm this zoo, and I don't think I'll be able to get anything through this spring." The exhausted minister moans, his gaze falling on the now setting sun, its fiery orange light glooming over the horizon. \n \n... \n \n“Order! Order! Silence your tongues, and let great Shushō Katsura speak, withhold your insolence!” \n \nThe hall becomes silent as footsteps from other chambers echo effortlessly off the marble walls. Katsura is seated on a multi-tiered semicircular platform in front of a central rostrum that divides the chamber. Banners depicting the Hinomaru, or eastern rising sun, hang from the front of the room's ceilings. \n \n'I propose to this great hall… the basis for the Railway Nationalization Act. . .' \n \n... \n \nThe candlelight glistens on the rough wooden table, which was meticulously carved by only the best for the job. A tiny document sits in the center of the table, and a hand rests near it, grasping a thin, white feather pen dipped in a little cup of black ink solution. Before a name is signed below it, the hand raises the pen from the cup, the ink droplets indicating their way up the page, etching across the document in proper scripting."

# INDUSTRIALIZATION DECISIONS #
JAP_industrialization_category: "The Japanese Industrial Revolution"
JAP_industrialization_category_desc: ""As with France, an important consequence of the British Industrial Revolution for China and Japan was military vulnerability. China was humbled by British sea power during the First Opium War, between 1839 and 1842, and the same threat became all too real for the Japanese as U.S. warships, led by Commodore Matthew Perry, pulled into Edo Bay in 1853. The reality that economic backwardness created military backwardness was part of the impetus behind Shimazu Nariakira's plan to overthrow the shogunate and put in motion the changes that eventually led to the Meiji Restoration. The leaders of the Satsuma domain realized that economic growth—perhaps even Japanese survival—could be achieved only by institutional reforms, but the shogun opposed this because his power was tied to the existing set of institutions. To exact reforms, the shogun had to be overthrown, and he was. The Japanese built their own armament industry. As a consequence of these initial differences, each country responded differently to the challenges of the nineteenth century, with Japan diverging dramatically in the face of the critical juncture created by the Industrial Revolution.""

 TSH_character_tokugawa_iesada_desc: "Born to weak health, Tokugawa Iesada was sheltered early in his life from the outside world to protect his health, and to make sure the only son and heir of Ieyoshi Shōgun could grow up to rule after him.\n\nIesada's rule has seen Japan be forced to open up to the outside world, and many catastrophic natural disasters that has ruined many cities and lives. His lack of participation in court life and rule of the Bakufu, paired with these disasters, have made his rule very unpopular among the common people. His perceived weakness and failure to protect Japan from foreign incursions have allowed his opponents to get the upper-hand."

Becoming the first shogun since Tokugawa Iemitsu in 1634 to travel to Kyoto. Shogun Iemochi tried to strengthen the power of the Shogunate and its ties to the Emperor. He then married Princess Kazu, daughter of Emperor Ninko as part of Kobbu Gattai which is an effort to strengthen ties between the Shogunate and the Emperor although Princess Kazu refused to use ‘Midaidokoro’ or “Official Wife of Shogun'' title. He also ended Sankin Kotai which weakened Shogun’s control over domains. His reign was also undermined by incompetent advisors. He died childless at a young age of 20 years old due to illness. But, he adopted a son, Tokugawa Iesato as his heir. At that time, he was only 3 years old, but as the Tokugawa Shogunate was at war with Chōshū, the adult Tokugawa Yoshinobu was appointed as the fifteenth Shogun."

 JAP_character_emperor_meiji_desc: "Prince Mutsuhito was born on November 3rd, 1852, in a small house on his maternal grandfather's property at the north end of the Gosho. In our time, birth is culturally believed to be a source of pollution, so the imperial prince was not born in the palace. Instead, it is common for members of the Imperial Family to be born near the pregnant woman's father's house. In the case of the titled young Prince Sachi, his mother, Nakayama Yoshiko, was the daughter of acting major counselor Nakayama Tadayasu and a concubine to Emperor Kōmei.\n \nDue to the imperial lifestyle being so obscured behind closed doors, his youthful personality is contested. Sometimes he was seen as healthy and strong, somewhat of a bully, and he was exceptionally talented at sumo. Others describe him as delicate and often ill. But at his age now, he has matured and grown and is considered a proper leader of the people.\n \nThe young prince was born into an era of great change in Japan. This change was symbolized dramatically in July 1853, when Commodore Matthew Perry and his "Black Ships" sailed into the harbor at Edo. Their smog piling high up, covering the horizon over the capital. For the first time in at least 250 years, the shogunate took the highly unusual step of consulting with the Imperial Court due to the crisis brought on by Perry's arrival. The talk of "unequal treaties," giving up tariff authority and the right to try foreigners in their own courts, spread throughout the country. After the shōguns' willingness to accept these treaties, Emperor Kōmei was so incensed that he threatened to abdicate—though even this action would have required the consent of the shōgun."
