 FRA_projecta_impera_desc: "His Majesty the Emperor has for over a decade pursued a statist policy influenced by all sorts of people.

 FRA_ferro_et_terra_desc: "Steel and Land. That is what our Empire rests upon. Though Fire and Smoke may fuel it greatly, and though Marble and Glass may make it pretty. . .we still need Land and Steel. The former grants us food, the latter grants us weapons.

 FRA_new_practices_for_new_empires: "New Practices for New Empires"
 FRA_new_practices_for_new_empires_desc: "The Future is now! Farming can not continue as in the old days, as if there are still Serfs and Bourbon Kings. New practices must be introduced. Reapers must be spread further, horses must be made avalible to more to purchase, so that toiling on land does not take an entire day. And further, who knows, perhaps this will also free up men for the Imperial Army."
 FRA_lowering_farmers_taxes: "Lowering Farmers Taxes"
 FRA_lowering_farmers_taxes_desc: "The Emperor and his allies have fervently done risky things for the public good. And almost always, it has paid off. One of this, was the hope that lowered taxes and support of financial institutions and competitive ventures would result in an increased treasury. It has. And so now, one must simply ask, why not grant what has been granted to the Banker and Artisan - to the Empire's finest? The farmer shall too, what all of France has. Prosperity and Abundance!"
 FRA_limited_land_redistribution: "Limited Land Redistribution"
 FRA_limited_land_redistribution_desc: "When the Republic and the Empire came about, many a thing was left empty. Signeurs et Madame left the French fatherland, for 'greener pastures'. Bah, traitors all! Nonetheless, now we are left with numerous estates to do something with. Now while we can't give every citizen a palace, we can sell off many a painting and grant each citizen some money, no? And after that, we can ensure that all those who worked on land without permanent housing, get at least some temporary semblence of it."
 FRA_establish_specialized_agricultural_education: "Establish Specialized Agricultural Education"
 FRA_establish_specialized_agricultural_education_desc: "We've given the farmer tools, we've lowered his taxes and we have now even given him some money to play around with. Now we must ensure that it is not wasted on booze and gambling. Our fervent lecturer, Victory Duruy, gets a new special task. To travel to the countryside and organize schools to ensure that France's best always know how to operate this new machinery. For the good of themselves and of France the great!"
 FRA_redistribution_of_orleans_properties: "Redistribution of Orleans Properties"
 FRA_redistribution_of_orleans_properties_desc: "Now comes the great show. We've redistributed the land of petty Monarchists who would dare fight our glorious and benevolent Empire. But now, we will end with Royal legacies for good. Numerous palaces of the Bourbon-Anjou and the Bourbon-Orleans lay empty. A few will be taken by the Emperor for personal projects and enjoyment, but the rest: au Peuple! Millions of France shall both be acquired by the state, and granted unto the people. Who will, naturally under our guidance, spend it well."
 FRA_compete_with_italian_grain: "Compete with Italian Grain"
 FRA_compete_with_italian_grain_desc: "The proclamation is a slight bit misleading. We fight not, just the Italian farmer. But the Spanish, German, British and Balkan one too. And all of them, our farmer must outcompete, outdo, and in doing so: profit from. Now as always, our friends the Latins, the South Slavs and others will not be hurt, we are a fair competitor. . .but the France must flow. And they will first flow to us, then anyone else."
 FRA_organized_departmental_farming: "Organized Departmental Farming"
 FRA_organized_departmental_farming_desc: "The Empire has, as said before, often been Statist. Now, for the most efficient of farming practices, Duruy will organize certain overseers and such to either advise on improved farming practices; or in cases of state-owned and leased land, order improvements. Now naturally this is a risky affair, but nonetheless we will do our best so that the land is used to it's greatest extent."
 FRA_spur_agricultural_ambition: "Spur Agricultural Ambition"
 FRA_spur_agricultural_ambition_desc: "Europe has grown restless. Industrialization has led to a flocking of cities, and thats not bad in itself. . .but, someone needs to feed the cities. As such, our Imperial government has decided that it would be wise to set up programs to help people to make their life on the countryside. To farm, and to perhaps get rich off of that, while feeding not only ourselves but Europe itself. Not to mention, a monopoly on foodstuffs will be very useful when it comes to politics too. How can you invade the one that feeds you?"
 FRA_rehabilitate_the_vandee: "Rehabilitate the Vandee"
 FRA_rehabilitate_the_vandee_desc: "The Vendee is a notoriously royalist region. First they revolted against the Republic. Then against Napoleon himself. Then against the Orleans! The Vendee is the most legitimist region there exists. . .and we've pacified it. Our Empress Eugenie, and the support of the Pope to us, has proven indispensable. Now, that region is calm and it is our duty to bring life back to it. After a practical genocide conducted by the Jacobins. Let us build up the land, let us give them money to re-start their farms. Let us give life back to the Vendee, and in so, earn their loyalty for more than just God and Country."
 FRA_ensure_food_for_the_army: "Ensure Food for the Army"
 FRA_ensure_food_for_the_army_desc: "Now that France is not only insured against famine, but insured as one of, or perhaps the foremost, producer of food in the world; we must ensure that our noble Army has it's share. There are hundreds of thousands of soldiers, and we tragically have to import food for these brave men. Now it is time to establish a very minor grain tax, that when utilized across all of France will permit us to feed our massive armies. With that in hand, we will be able to project our influence without any worry that our good men might starve. And if some remains, well, more profit to be made."
 FRA_a_prosperous_farmland: "A Prosperous Farmland"
 FRA_a_prosperous_farmland_desc: "Minerva would surely be proud of us. Our wise acts have ensured a prosperous French countryside, that produces more grain than any nation in the world, perhaps one day it will do even more than Russia itself. For now however, our great Napoleon will be happy to know that his nephew has not only done good by his name, but even more so. Famines are not only eradicated as a possibility, but trounced on with France becoming an exporter of grain. Let us thus simply say: Hurrah pour l'Empereur Napoleon III!"
 FRA_ignis_et_fumus: "Ignies Et Fumus"
 FRA_ignis_et_fumus_desc: "Fire and Smoke. While steel and land are needed to produce, we need fire and smoke to refine. We need them to travel, we need them to shoot, and much else. As such, we shall bolster our industry beyond all measure, and not only catch-up to the likes of Britain but overtake them. And then, none will be able to even breathe without thinking: ah, the French have made this!"
 FRA_break_the_hold_of_artisans: "Break the Hold of Artisans"
 FRA_break_the_hold_of_artisans_desc: "Like the economies of old, France is still dominated primarily by Artisans. While France is the best economy when it comes to banking and finances. . .well, industrially speaking we are much less so. Now we shall decrease tariffs on industrial goods, and promote artisans joining together to form grand factories! This way, their hold on our economy will be broken, and the nation able to make progress!"
 FRA_continued_industrial_advancement: "Continued Industrial Advancement"
 FRA_continued_industrial_advancement_desc: "While we make our march against weak Artisans and against the backwardness of the countryside: we shall also march to advance what already is there. His Majesty has opened up several tenders of technological and industrial advancement with the goal of bringing bright minds to Paris and the nation. Naturally certain Conservatives condemn this as unnecessary migrant-catching, but we know that the Empire will have the brightest minds of Europe!"
 FRA_grant_mange_the_blank_check: "Grant Mange the Black Check"
 FRA_grant_mange_the_blank_check_desc: "Pierre Magne is the great minister of finance in our wonderful Empire, and he has made his intent clear. To build railways until all of France can travel from their small village in Provance, to Paris, within just a few hours! And our Emperor is inclined to agree with him, and so has given Magne the blank check with the ministry. He shall build to his heart's content, and shall bring prestige and glory to France - as well as grandiose economic benefit. By increasing the number of railways, we will expand tourism, economic advancement of private persons and naturally, decrease the time of mobilization."

Ironclads, even more steam power, explosive breech-loading guns and much else; have become a daily part of naval combat. We must ensure that our ports can actually build such ships, and so we shall expand them, modernize them, and make sure that they out-do anything the perfidious Albion or the rabid Russian can try and make. France shall rule the Waves!"
 FRA_foulds_begrudging_subsidies: "Foulds Begrugding Subsidies"
 FRA_foulds_begrudging_subsidies_desc: "Achille Fould is the fiscal conservative in our ministry of finance, and a great proponent of fiscal responsibility. However, even he must at times consent to certain planned acts so that the French nation can out pace all others. As such His Majesty has managed to convince Fould to grant a sizeable subsidy check to industrial projects across France so that our nation can continue it's unimpeded economic golden age."
 FRA_the_art_of_refining: "The Art of Refining"
 FRA_the_art_of_refining_desc: "While we may make all that we want, we must also refine what we have. Algerian lead, Alsatian coal, Gold from Aquitaine. All of that has to be used for something, lest it simply sit under the ground, doing nothing. As such, we shall push for our youth to actually learn how to refine the materials at their disposal. And then, when they do that, we shall utilize those resources to produce guns, railway carts, fuel, whatever our glorious Empire needs!"
 FRA_first_batches_of_coal_and_steel: "First Batches of Coal and Steel"
 FRA_first_batches_of_coal_and_steel_desc: "It is a sad fact, but France is not endowed with infinite resources. Coal and Steel dry up, and as much as we do our best to mine in Provence and in Alsace, there is still not enough. As such we must begin to import our first batches of coal and steel from Britain and from America. Rue we the day when we begin to import something from the Prussians, but it might need to be considered later on. For now though, let us rejoice that our industry is so grand that we must import to keep it running at these speeds!"
 FRA_strengthen_the_ports_of_bordeaux: "Strengthen the Ports of Bordeaux"
 FRA_strengthen_the_ports_of_bordeaux_desc: "While we have done our best to strengthen all of our ports, with special care towards Marseille and Toulon where most of our fleet resides - we must strengthen one more with great care. Bordeaux, the seat of at least one Atlantic fleet. While it might not be a center of production and while it may take ages if Bordeaux is ever to reach that stage - it will still benefit us to enlarge and re-outfit the port so that should war come, repairs and safety are still guaranteed. And if Bordeaux's mayors manage to bless the city with a truly marvelous port, all the glory to them."
 FRA_embolden_the_silk_of_lyon: "Embolden the Silk of Lyon"
 FRA_embolden_the_silk_of_lyon_desc: "While France might be bashing down the walls between backwardness and the future - there are still some things which we shall not only keep, but embolden. And that is our trade of fine clothes, of refined jewels and much else. And for that, what better starting point than the Silk of Lyon? For centuries a major place for fine clothing, it shall now earn the subsidies of the nation and ensure that when one thinks of Luxury: they shall think of France! And not any France, but France of the Roman and Imperial Eagle, where the rightful heirs of Augustus, Caesar, Trajan and Constantine reign!"

In Prussia all men between 20 and 40 must do military service. In France, conscription is still done by lottery and the rich can pay other to serve in their place to avoid it. Even if the number of active soldiers of both countries are comparable, the French Army must divide its soldiers between colonies and the reserve is not ready to fight. Adolphe Niel estimated that there are 200,000 French soldiers who can defend the Rhine against up to 350,000 Prussians (double with the reserve). Adolphe Niel proposed the \"Garde Nationale mobile\" a copy of the Prussian military system, but the people and the deputies don’t want it."

In the recognition of this truth, an interesting proposition has come forth from within trade commissions and economic circles...\n\nA typical inconvenience in international trade are unfixed exchange rates between currencies, as each currency follows its own standards of minting, weighing and metal composition. This leads to exchange uncertainty, as a trader in France may not get the value of goods for the weight of his coin abroad. Thusly, a proposal for a so-called 'Monetary Union' has been presented.\n\nThis 'Union' would, if agreed upon by other nations, standardize exchange rates between nations. This would make it so that coins from abroad can be exchanged for the French Franc at a set equal value, per bimetallic standard, both ways. This would make trade a much simpler and effective affair, but requires some fellow nations to participate... shall we form this Monetary Union?"

 FRA_latin_monetary_union_greece_desc: "The Greeks have expressed an interest in joining the LMU, citing one of the clauses of the treaty which allows nations willing to abide by the treaty's stipulations to join the union's member states. The Kingdom of Greece lies in a valuable position to contest the waters along the Bosphorus, and letting them into the union may work just as much as a diplomatic move as an economic one... shall Greece enter the Monetary Union?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_russia: "Bilateral agreement with Russia"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_russia_desc: "While St. Petersburg has expressed no desire in joining the treaty, the interest of the equal exchange concept has not fallen on deaf ears it seems. A separate agreement may be able to be struck, however, but with exchange rates being standardized from banks of the member unions in relation to the Bank of Russia, with regards to fiscal and monetary notes. This agreement, while different, could make trade simpler for our partners in Russia."
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_spain: "Bilateral agreement with Spain"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_spain_desc: "Spain is doubtful of the implications of the treaty, and negotiations have thusfar been fruitless despite interest in the concept. A bilateral agreement might be beneficial as a replacement to union membership, even if the agreement has to be slightly slanted to the Spaniards..."
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_romania: "Bilateral agreement with Romania"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_romania_desc: "The newly founded nation of the Romanian people have expressed an interest in our currency union, and is willing to enter as a member. However, disagreements in treaty application and organization has lead to unsuccessful negotiations, and Romania remains outside the agreement. Despite the concessions, perhaps we can persuade the Romanians with a modified bilateral agreement?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_austria_hungary: "Bilateral agreement with Austria-Hungary"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_austria_hungary_desc: "Vienna has expressed a clear rejection of the LMU treaty and its stipulations, reasoning that a bimetallic monetary system is not appealing to their economic interests, as their own system is that of a monometallic monetary system. Maybe we could persuade them with an agreement of equal exchange between our gold Francs and their Florin between treasuries?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_monaco: "Bilateral agreement with Monaco"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_monaco_desc: "Our small neighbour in the south, Monaco, is tied to us in a way that is inseverable. They do not want a full membership in our union, but have expressed a positive desire to make use of the LMU standard for trade between currencies. An agreement would be most beneficial for us both."
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_serbia: "Unilateral agreement with Serbia"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_serbia_desc: "The Serbians are not interested in participating directly in the union and its exchanges, but has shown to want to make use of the LMU standard for coin minting. While we can't make them abide by our standardization and exchange rate due to metal percentages being different, we could perhaps set special exchange rates between their standard and ours?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_bulgaria: "Unilateral agreement with Bulgaria"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_bulgaria_desc: "Bulgaria, much like Serbia, does not want to enter the union but does want to use the LMU standardization of minting. We could make a unilateral agreement which would exchange union currency at a rate which is equal to the value of the Bulgarian coins; all we need to know is if the Bulgarian's will agree to this or not..."

In 1821 Alexis Bouvard have gathered 40 years of observations but didn’t succeed to fix the model by supposing the addition of an unknown planet. The British John Couch Adams worked on it but it was the French Urbain Le Verrier which computed the orbit of this unknown planet in 1845. The Prussian Johann Gottfried Galle observed the planet in 1846 which will be called Neptune. Urbain Le Verrier tried to do the same thing do explain anomalies with Mercury orbit. In 1859, a doctor an amateurish astronom, Edmond Modeste Lescarbault sent a letter to Le Verrier to report an observation of a corps. Le Verrier announce this year that it is a planet and gives it the name Vulcan.  We expect further observations will confirm the 9th planet which is between Mercury and the sun."

 nap_france.320.t: "The Treaty of Luxembourg"
 nap_france.320.d: "We are victorious! Prussia has been crushed, and we can now push our conditions onto them. They can still refuse, but with the state of their army and their country, they are not in a position to project any power."

 nap_france.4.t: "OUR EMPEROR IS UNDER ATTACK !"
 nap_france.4.d: "It's 8:30 p.m. The imperial cortege arrives on the Boulevard des Italiens; the entourage is led by a squadron of lancers, followed by the emperor's personal sedan—and thirty meters further back—Princess Mathilde's carriage. The assembly takes a left onto Rue Le Peletier, where the opera is located opposite number nineteen. The convoy stops there, awaiting for it's departure. An eerie silence sweeps over the area, followed by a screeching explosion. A small bomb had been thrown below the horses of the lancers, sending the stallions fleeing from the streets. The crowds that had gathered gasped at the disturbance, as cries of panic followed en suite. Not a moment later, does the choir of screeches strum again, as a second bomb lands below the hitch and a third below the emperor's sedan, turning it on its side and shattering the glass windows. The screeches turn to cries as the guards race to the sedan and open the car door..."
 nap_france.4.a: "The woeful cries only grow drearier as the emperor's limp body tumbles out."
 nap_france.4.b: "The cries turn to hitched gasps as the emperor is alive!"

 nap_france.399.t: "The Death of Napoleon III"
 nap_france.399.d: "After years battling both Prussians and illness, the emperor Napoléon III Bonaparte has finally passed away. His reign was tumultuous, and wasn't very popular, but he has inspired France greatly, and brought modernity and industrialism into a nation that was struggling to find stabiltiy.\n\nHis son, Napoléon Eugène, is the imperial heir for the throne. While he might never rule France, he still has taken the title of "Napoléon IV", a title recognized by many Bonapartites already."
 nap_france.399.a: "Long live Napoleon IV !"

 nap_france.400.t: "Renovation of Lyon"
 nap_france.400.d: "Most urban renovations took place during the Second Empire. The prefect of Rhône and Mayor of Lyon Vaïsse undertook these large transformations, similar to Haussmann's in Paris, the reason being the prestige and security of the city. His work was supported by different people: the Chief Engineer of the Roads, appointed in 1854, Gustave Bonnet and the architect Benoit Poncet, who designed the Imperial Street (now Rue de la République) in the 1850s."
 nap_france.400.a: "Better living conditions for our people!"

 nap_france.401.t: "Renovation of Marseille"
 nap_france.401.d: "The XIXth century was for France the century of great projects and great achievements. From 1840, Marseille launched a major counstruction program never before seen in the history of the city. One the most important investments was Rue Imperiale. Almost 2.500 workers were involved in the building. On the 15th of August, 1864, Rue Imperiale was inaugurated in the presence of Napoleon III. After the fall of the Second Empire, it became Rue de la Republique."

 latin_monetary_union.1.t: "Establishment of Latin Monetary Union"
 latin_monetary_union.1.d: "Today, the governments of France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland have made a joint statement addressing the conclusion of discussions, and the founding of a new treaty union: The Latin Monetary Union.\n\nThe Latin Monetary Union, abreviated as the LMU, seeks to unify the currency of each member-state under one standardized system of mintage. This system makes the exchange rates of coinage between the members Italy, Switzerland, Belgium and France equal. This meaning the coins are united in value and are usable without conversion in all member nations, as long as the dimensions, weight and metal compositions remain mostly identical. The Union was a proposal made by French officials, and its founding would suggest a closer cooperation between each member-state's and French economic interests in Europe.\n\nWhat will become of this union over the ages, only time will tell..."
 latin_monetary_union.1.a: "A union is born!"
 latin_monetary_union.2.t: "Ask Greece to join Latin Monetary Union"
 latin_monetary_union.2.d: "Our diplomats to Greece have reported a possibility to invite the Greeks into joining the FMU.\n\nFeelers among the diplomatic corps sent to Greece have gotten positive impressions of the potential prospects of a Greek entry into the FMU, and believe that giving them a direct invitation might be a good way to give off a good impression about the LMU. The Greeks are generally positive about the stipulations of the treaty, and have shown an definitive interest in the coinage standardization which the LMU offers, besides the currency having the strength of the other members economic backing.\n\nThere are many potential benefits for the Greeks if they decide to fully enter the monetary union, however, the decision ultimately falls to them."
 latin_monetary_union.2.a: "Send our greetings!"
 latin_monetary_union.3.t: "Bilateral agreement with Latin Monetary Union"
 latin_monetary_union.3.d: "We do not agree with all the stipulations that the LMU imposes if we were to join as a full member, thusly making the treaty undesirable for our continued interest.\n\nHowever, while we aren't interested in joining the LMU as a full member-state it would still be prudent and a definitive necessity to interact with it on an economic basis. The standardizing of mintage and coinage is an appealing idea, but perhaps there are other ways of making a set exchange rate for our treasury or currency in relations to the LMU?\n\nThis way we could trade with the LMU on more equal terms without joining the union in full."
 latin_monetary_union.3.a: "A bilateral agreement is desirable"
 latin_monetary_union.3.b: "We do not want this"
 latin_monetary_union.4.t: "Unilateral agreement with Latin Monetary Union"
 latin_monetary_union.4.d: "The LMU system of coinage is an interesting idea which could be used to our advantage, despite us not being interested in the treaty. Perhaps we could make our own standard of exchange by the LMU system for our own purposes, while getting an agreement to make use of such a system in relation to exchange rates to the LMU and other associates with similar systems? This would give us the advantage of making a coinage which is usable for trade across many nations in Europe, while being more tailored to our own purposes."
 latin_monetary_union.4.a: "Standardization it is!"
 latin_monetary_union.4.b: "Our existing coins are sufficient"

#FRANCO PRUSSIAN WAR

 third_rep_france.001.t: "Proclamation of the Third Republic"
 third_rep_france.001.d: "After the capture of Napoleon in Sedan, the deputies gathered urgently at the Bourbon Palace to decide the fate of the nation. However, under the pressure of the crowd gathered in front of the Palace, Leon Gambetta, from the top of the Town Hall, solemnly proclaimed today the birth of a new republic."
 third_rep_france.001.a: "Vive la République !"

 third_rep_france.002.t: "The Establishment of the Gouvernement Provisoire"
 third_rep_france.002.d: "To lead the nation against the Prussian invasion, a new "Government of National Defense", leaded by the General Trochu, have been created to lead our army and our country."
 third_rep_france.002.a: "We will follow his decisions"

 third_rep_france.0021.t: "Socialist influence is growing in France"
 third_rep_france.0021.d: "In this troubled period, organizations are forming everywhere in France to support the most disadvantaged, as in the capital where Republican Central Committee of the Twenty Arrondissements tries to obtain from the new government political and social measures favorable to the popular classes."
 third_rep_france.0021.a: "Let's keep an eye on them"

 third_rep_france.006.t: "The Siege of Paris"
 third_rep_france.006.d: "The French Army has been unable to stop the Prussian advance, and now, they surround the capital completely. This siege was something the generals knew was going to happen, but like often during this war the ineffectiveness and lack of preparation from the Army will lead to difficult times for the Parisians.\n\nHopefully, the Prussians will be pushed back soon enough."
 third_rep_france.006.a: "This is not over !"

 third_rep_france.007.t: "Entrevue de Ferrières"
 third_rep_france.007.d: "The war is now over for us. We have lost, and the Prussians crushed us under the might of their united German army. It is time to call the Prussian high command, and to discuss the terms for peace.\n\nThe location was chosen to be the Ferrières Castle, east of Paris. It will, and has, to stay secret, to protect the stability of the new French government, and to assure that the terms discussed will be debated fairly. The Prussian chancellor and the French foreign ministers will discuss the terms for peace, and hopefully, they will find something both sides can agree on."
 third_rep_france.007.a: "We hope to bring peace"

 third_rep_france.0071.t: "Entrevue de Ferrières"
 third_rep_france.0071.d: "We have received a message from the newly formed French government, we have finally made them bend the knee. Confronted to the might of the German armies, they have now asked us to discuss peace in the Ferrières Castle near Paris. This discussion with the French foreign minister will let us push our demands.\n\nWe have for decades longed for the time we could retake the lands of Alsace-Lorraine, German lands which we are legitimate to claim. On top of that, we could use the opportunity to strengthen our German unity. Beating the French Empire is a gift on its own, but this the closest we expect to have from a capitulation. We have our demands, and they'll have to accept it."
 third_rep_france.0071.a: "The war needs to cease, we won already after all"

 third_rep_france.0072.t: "Entrevue de Ferrières"
 third_rep_france.0072.d: "The Prussian chancellor has agreed to peace, but with horrendous terms. We shall renounce to the territory of Alsace-Lorraine, which will be transferred to the Kingdom of Prussia. Peace is vital for France, the war has destroyed a lot of lives already, but these terms are very restraining and may be problematic. But we must do what's needed to save France from an ever growing disaster. We must agree to these terms. But first, we must prepare ourselves from what might come. Let us take the time to carefully think about these terms."
 third_rep_france.0072.a: "Sacrifices must be made"
 third_rep_france.0072.b: "No way we accept the conditions"

 third_rep_france.008.t: "Léon Gambetta leaves Paris in a balloon"
 third_rep_france.008.d: "The siege of Paris won't stop our politicians from organizing the rest of the nation! The new Minister of the Interior, the socialist Léon Gambetta, has jumped into a balloon to quit the city. The aim of such a surprising move, is to organize the French Army that are awaiting orders from the government since the start of the siege.\n\nWhat could be seen as an extravagant and excentric way of leaving a city, is in reality probably the best way for him to leave, and to go behind enemy lines. Of course this isn't without risk, but Gambetta is the type of politician that would risk being shot by a Prussian, if it's to save the nation."
 third_rep_france.008.a: "At least it must be fun"

 third_rep_france.0081.t: "Government delegation sent in Tours"
 third_rep_france.0081.d: "The government having chosen to remain in Paris surrounded by Prussian troops and their allies, a delegation was sent to Tours to coordinate the action in the provinces under the orders of Adolphe Crémieux, Minister of Justice, accompanied by Alexandre Glais-Bizoin and Admiral Fourichon."
 third_rep_france.0081.a: "Hope they manage to turn the situation around"

 third_rep_france.0082.t: "Government delegation retreat in Bordeaux"
 third_rep_france.0082.d: "The Prussian advance forced the government delegation installed in the city of Tours to withdraw this morning further south to Bordeaux. Although the capital manages to repel the invaders who have besieged the city for several months now, the situation in the countryside portends the worst ..."
 third_rep_france.0082.a: "This is our last chance..."

 third_rep_france.0083.t: "Government delegation captured in Bordeaux !"
 third_rep_france.0083.d: "It's a catastrophe! Without warning, in the middle of the night, the Prusian army made a Perseus in the French defense and entered the city of Bordeaux where the government delegation was now prisoners of the Prussians! The signing of the armistice should be concluded in the afternoon ..."
 third_rep_france.0083.a: "This is the end !"

 third_rep_france.009.t: "Insurrections in Paris"
 third_rep_france.009.d: "The siege continues, and the people are getting tired of the poor performance of the newly formed government. A recent streak of military losses, due to a lack of long term planning and quick response tactics, has prompted new insurrections in the capital. Charles Delescluze has called in his newspaper to form the Commune, and to fight against the government.\n\nThis small scale uprising won't topple our government, but it has been the rallying cause for a few of our government members, like Léon Gambetta and Henri Rochefort. Rochefort wants us to accept this uprising as a normal response to a time of crisis, and let them continue. The army however, don't want to deal with internal threats at the same time as the Prussian Army."
 third_rep_france.009.a: "Put down this insurrection"

 third_rep_france.0101.t: "The Government won the plebiscite"
 third_rep_france.0101.d: "The Parisians have spoken! The Government of National Defense obtained a large majority in the vote and will be able to continue the fight !"
 third_rep_france.0101.a: "We will not fail !"

 third_rep_france.0102.t: "The Government loose the plebiscite"
 third_rep_france.0102.d: "The Parisians have spoken! The national defense government did not obtain the majority in the vote. General Trochu is expected to decide the fate of the government very soon."
 third_rep_france.0102.a: "This is the End"

 third_rep_france.0103.t: "Louis Jules Trochu steps down"
 third_rep_france.0103.d: "Another day, another demonstration in Paris. France has suffered again and again losses on the battlefield, and the government continues to resist the terms given by the Prussians for peace. However, these past few days have been too much for general Trochu. He has today announced his resignation from the government. The last resistant against the Prussian agreement is now gone, and the government prepares itself to sign the peace deal."
 third_rep_france.0103.a: "Looks like it is the End..."

 third_rep_france.0104.t: "French Army Defeated"
 third_rep_france.0104.d: "If the republican armies have been able until today to limit the Prussian advance as much as possible, today the battle took place which will seal the tragic fate of this war which has cost France so much ..."
 third_rep_france.0104.a: "Looks like it is the End..."

Rochefort was a great voice, bridging the gap between the communist Blanquists and the moderate government. While he often went against our main republican lines, he still was an important figure of the French Republic. But we don't need authoritarians in our new government, and Rochefort's departure will not make our job any harder than what it already is."

# 1871 LEGISLATIVE ELECTION

 third_rep_france.014.t: "First Legislative Election of the Republic"
 third_rep_france.014.d: "A glorious day for the republic, it's election time! These elections will decide the landscape of our first Parliament, giving an advantage to one of the four major parties present in France and powerful enough to have representatives.\n\nThe Legitimists are the monarchists, supporters of the return to a more classical French monarchy. This party has lots of supporters among the conservative circles, but isn't very popular among the population. The Modérés are, like their name suggest, more moderate conservatives. Supporters of the republic, they still have very conservative views and politics. The Liberals are centrist politicians, who are keen to pleasing everyone. Keeping stability in the new republic might not be a bad idea after all. Finally, the Radicals are socialist poltilicans, pushing for a more centralized economy and for a more welfare-centric nation. Extremly popular, it is also a party that could calm down the recent problems we have with communists insurgencies."
 third_rep_france.014.a: "It's democracy time."

 third_rep_france.0141.t: "Monarchists won the Election."
 third_rep_france.0141.d: "If the election seemed to oppose Monarchists, composed of the Legitimists, Orléanists and the Napoleonians, and Republicans, it was ultimately aimed at deciding the future of the conflict between pacifist monarchists and Republicans in favor of total war. Exhausted by several long months of conflict, the French finally chose peace."

 third_rep_france.15.t: "Resentment in Paris"
 third_rep_france.15.d_thiers: "Adolphe Thiers has been in French politics for years before becoming the President. During the July Monarchy, he erected what was later called the "Thiers Wall" to protect the city from invaders following the 1848 revolution. Not only that, but he also has shown some resentment towards the National Guards, fearing that they might rise up to oust him. Now his fears might become true. Rumors are going around that they are planning to take over the government. They are socialists at heart, the very young republic might get destroyed once again, we cannot let that happen."
 third_rep_france.15.d_gambetta: "Léon Gambetta is a popular figure, both for the republicans and the socialists. He is charismatic, and has made clear that nobody is going to stop his societal reforms following his election. But both the Military and the Socialists want to be assured of his policies. The military fears that he'll be too liberal, the socialist fear that he will be too conservative to please the majority. Léon Gambetta is in a tough position, and has to choose which faction he wants to help, and which faction he needs to betray."
 third_rep_france.15.d_rochefort: "The first President of our new Republic is not the most popular one among our socialist peers. Henri Rochefort has shown himself to be a quite ruthless and authoritarian leader, and on top of that someone who frequent Auguste Blanqui, a known hard-line marxist. The French army has already expressed their worries about this new ruler, and Patrice de Mac-Mahon has become the most prominent opponent to Rochefort among the military. Intelligence reports show the suspicious behavior of some of our war veterans."
 third_rep_france.15.a: "Confiscate the National Guard's cannons"
 third_rep_france.15.b: "Let's meet both of them"
 third_rep_france.15.c: "Talk with the Blanquists"
 third_rep_france.15.d: "Everything's fine"

 third_rep_france.16.t: "The [GetDateText] Uprising"
 third_rep_france.16.d: "Recent governmental decisions were unsatisfying for parts of the Army. The recent confiscation of the guns of our National Guard, in the hopes of controlling a situation that would have spiraled down, has made them join the socialist cause. Reports are talking about an insurrection, but lot of experts in the government are already talking about a revolution.\n\nBrace yourself Paris, the struggle is far from being over."
 third_rep_france.16.a: "It has begun"

 third_rep_france.17.t: "The [GetDateText] Military Uprising"
 third_rep_france.17.d: "Following the arrest of Patrice de Mac-Mahon, parts of our miltiary have risen up against our government and has declared war on our régime. Their headquarters are in Bordeaux, and they are already making offensives along the Garonne to secure their hold of Aquitaine. Our high command is completly taken by surprise, and troops are reorganized erratically with what's left of our generals and commanders. So little time after the Franco-Prussian War that humiliated France, we now have to face another conflict."
 third_rep_france.17.a: "France cannot escape war it seems"
 third_rep_france.17.b: "We cannot let the Socialists take over!"

 third_rep_france.18.t: "The Meeting"
 third_rep_france.18.d: "The communist group of Auguste Blanqui has been a pain for the French government since it was called to replace the imperial regime. However, recent problematic military moves has prompted the need for a political deal, a compromise.\n\nBlanqui proposed that we should get rid of general Patrice de Mac-Mahon. The illustrious military officier is also a staunch legitimist, and a man with great influence on the army. While we can't accuse him of conspiracy, it is true that we could remove him swiftly, resolving the problem very elegantly. However, our army is already at its weakest point in decades, some may even say centuries, and thus removing one of the most efficient military officer from our army might completly destroy us. This is an ultimatum in disguise, either we remove Mac-Mahon and face a possible military uprising, or we let him continue and we face a socialist uprising. There's no right solution here."
 third_rep_france.18.a: "We'll be sure to eliminate Mac-Mahon"
 third_rep_france.18.b: "We don't want to make our military weaker than it already is"

 third_rep_france.19.t: "The [GetDateText] Military Coup"
 third_rep_france.19.d: "The disastrous French government hasn't managed to keep its own Army under their command. In a move only outshined by the continuous conflict against Prussia, parts of the French Army, led by general Patrice de Mac-Mahon, has risen up and has called their own government of national salvation down in Aquitaine. We now have another enemy to face, our own army, and without these key miltiary commanders we are now even weaker than before."
 third_rep_france.19.a: "Rochefort has seen it coming"

 third_rep_france.20.t: "The Worries of the Socialists"
 third_rep_france.20.d: "The socialists have called upon us to stregthen the basics of our nascent democracy, and to protect at all cost the social liberties gained by the end of the rule of the Emperor. It is too early to make rock-strong promises, but it's probably what's needed to keep our nation in one piece. However, giving in too much to them might anger an already frustrated army."
 third_rep_france.20.a: "Of course, we'll stay true to our beliefs"
 third_rep_france.20.b: "Some sacrifices are needed to create a strong nation"
 third_rep_france.20.c: "The future of France is not socialist"

 third_rep_france.21.t: "The Worries of the Army"
 third_rep_france.21.d: "The army has strong conservative values, and even among the most loyal to Trochu's provisionnal government, there's a fear of leaning in too much towards the socialists. They want reassurance that the new government will protect French values and traditions, and will continue to support efforts to stregthen the army and its budget moving forward."
 third_rep_france.21.a: "We won't forget about our values and tradition"
 third_rep_france.21.b: "We trust the democratic process"
 third_rep_france.21.c: "We must march forward towards progress"

 third_rep_france.22.t: "The Socialists are happy with our decisions"
 third_rep_france.22.d: "After hearing both sides, and making our decisions, we have received reports that socialists leaders are generally happy with them. The internal peace gained from that might be temporary, but every day saved is a blessing considering the current state of the nation."
 third_rep_france.22.a: "Wonderful, we were able to reassure them"

 third_rep_france.23.t: "The Socialists are worried about our decisions"
 third_rep_france.23.d: "After hearing both sides, and making our decisions, we have received reports that socialists leaders are weary of the positions we have taken. Demonstrations are already being organized, and it seems that our move to create a fairer system might have resulted in a loss of faith from them."
 third_rep_france.23.a: "We cannot please everyone"

 third_rep_france.24.t: "General strike in Paris"
 third_rep_france.24.d: "The recent positions taken by the government has prompted strikes in the capital. Organized by socialists, these are targeted towards the government, who it seems cannot please them. The size of the strike is worrying though, and reports are talking about an even bigger demonstration being prepared soon. Who knows what the future holds, but the Republic isn't off to a great start."
 third_rep_france.24.a: "Worrying"

 third_rep_france.25.t: "The Army is happy with our decisions"
 third_rep_france.25.d: "Our positions have pleased the influential military commanders in our Army. We can't afford losing the support from our only defense against the Prussian threat, and such reports reassures the government in its actions and decisions. There might be some hope for France after all."
 third_rep_france.25.a: "Wonderful, we were able to reassure them"

 third_rep_france.26.t: "The Army is worried about our decisions"
 third_rep_france.26.d: "The revent decisions taken by the government about the worries of its people and army hasn't been popular among the influencial military commanders. While some are just losing their faith, others are already talking about "incompetency", and could become problematic in our ongoing conflict against the Prussians."
 third_rep_france.26.a: "We cannot please everyone"

 third_rep_france.27.t: "Military demonstrations in Paris"
 third_rep_france.27.d: "Is was obvious, some among the military are now refusing to fight, called our government "illegitimate" and "uneffective". Our military has been weakened enough, we don't need such demonstrations, but it seems that we have lost them for good now. Negotiations were tried, but ultimatly failed. It seems that we must live with an even more weakened Army."

dynmod_FRA_imperial_army: "L'Armée de la Victoire"
dynmod_FRA_imperial_army_desc: "The Army of Victory resides in France. It is the best in Europe, in the world! It's leader, the brave Emperor Napoleon, has given unto his army laurel after laurel, in all the corners of the world. From Algeria, to Crimea, to Italy and to Asia. The Imperial Army is the strongest of all! While the Imperial armoury can at times lack by a few years, the training provided to the Imperial Army is immaculate. The officer corps is the most veteran of all, and is honed through regular deployments to Algeria. Every officer who wants a good career, first tastes the merciless steel and powder of an Arab guerrilla. Then, he can face the fine lines of a European army, for he has seen much worse and is ready for much worse. Others, find homes in the Imperial foreign legion, which takes all the misfits of the world and turns them into patriotic Frenchmen, loyal to the Emperor and their legionary brothers unto death. Then of course, there are the Generals, similarly so some of the best. Who but Bazaine could lay claim to be the best cavalryman in Europe? Who but MacMahon could lay claim to lead the best infantry in Europe? None! Now naturally, pride is the death of victory, but the French Empire has earned it's pride, and it will continue to earn it for a long time. Vive l'Empire!"

dynmod_FRA_imperial_navy: "La Grande Marine"
dynmod_FRA_imperial_navy_desc: "The first Napoleon had the grand Army...Napoleon III, has the grand navy. Napoleon III has since his ascent to the presidency, and then throne, practically doubled the budget of the navy. He has also nearly doubled the number of effective sailors in the Navy. From some twenty thousand sailors, to almost forty thousand sailors. From some one hundred million Francs, to two hundred million Francs. A budget so large, even Britain's is starting to be caught up to. Now, while the dream of reaching Britain's ship count is questionable, due to Britain's large number of transport and supply ships relevant to their Empire; the Emperor has managed to parry them in the number of combatant ships. Over a hundred vessels sit just in the internal sea {Mediterranean}, defying every single navy in the area. The Italians can weep, Spanish cry, Ottomans wail; but the French Navy will always prevail. Now, why has the Emperor done this, now that he has Britain's friendship? The reason is rather simple, as the Russians say - Trust but verify. And apart from that, the Emperor has designs of Empire, if not always in Europe, then on other continents, and when someone has to blow things up who better than a ship with three hundred guns and explosive shells? As such, so long as the Emperor remains, so too will the Grand Navy."

FRA_empire_autoritaire_desc: "His Majesty, the Emperor Napoleon III, runs a very tight ship. First as President and then as Emperor, the person of his majesty rarely shied away from decisive and often bloody measures to bring about political and social goals. This has not stopped, and continues to define the political landscape of the Empire. However, unlike in most authoritarian regimes, this has not brought about general suffering or mass surveillance for the purposes of bad ends. Rather however, it has resulted in a nation which is advancing in all aspects with rapid pace and ambition to overcome the entire continent! Within just the past decade, over 3,000 Kilometers of railways have been constructed. Several conflicts started either against or by the Empire have been won. Rights of the fairer sex, ignored or even crushed at times, now make great strides under the advice of Empress Eugenie and the personal interest of Emperor Napoleon III. The rights of the workers have also advanced, and the economic golden age as described by some is just getting started. Over a thousand banks have been opened up just by the current point, and the Authoritarian Empire with it's strong hold, seems to be pushing for even more. Naturally, this has come at the cost of certain political freedoms and the presence of the Gendarmerie Imperiale is undeniable. . .but, for the common Frenchman, this is a fine enough state. For if the Emperor will make France the only place where the right to eat is assured, the freedom to read is not needed."

FRA_laurier_victoire: "Laurier de la Victoire"
FRA_laurier_victoire_desc: "The French Empire's tricolor waves proudly across the world. The British, so arrogant, have grown to fear and respect the Emperor. The Russians have been struck down in the Crimean War and the petty Sultan of the Mohammedan faith understands who his superior is. The ones in Egypt stand ready, for the Emperor and his architects inquire most soundly unto a canal to bridge the seas. In Italy, the enemies of His Holiness and by proxy his most Imperial Majesty, lay dead and defeated. The French Empire shall be rivaled by none! This all has naturally led to a lot of good things in the fatherland. Trade flows from almost all corners of the globe, just as Faidhbere predicted it would. In the east, the peoples of the Balkans and of Poland look to us, rather than others, for guidance and liberation. And so, our influence spans Europe indirectly if not directly. The common man can read almost monthly, of our great victories occurring either now, or rarely more than two years in the past. And mothers can dream, that their child too shall earn the legion of honor for the Empire of a century grand. Vive l'Empire! Vive l'Armee! Vive la France!"

FRA_economie_liberale_projets_imperiaux: "Économie Libérale et Projets Impériaux"
FRA_economie_liberale_projets_imperiaux_desc: "His Majesty has always had a self-contradictory economic and national policy. He is a 'Conservative Emperor' who advances women and social rights. He is a revolutionary who uses grapeshot on his former Italian allies. He is an infantryman, who designs artillery. He is a Monarch, who creates plans for civilian stoves. And this trend of doing what he usually should not, extends to economics too. His Majesty has been a massive supporter of liberal trade ideals. Low tariffs, low inquiry and other such things. On the other hand, he has been the most vigorous of builders, designers and planners. It is he who orders Haussmann to review prefectures and add to them various places of interest. It is he who continually bludgeons the rich with protections of the worker. And yet it is also he who slashes taxes to all within the nation, and the one who lets the British and Spanish trade on equal footing with the French. This has sadly, created some problems. The Imperial economy is heavily reliant on her colonies, which deliver to the Empire resources which are then sold and made profit off. Furthermore, the Emperor's policies while successful at making life 'wonderful' for most, has not granted unto the Empire mass-industrialization as he had wished. As such, until either he begins to construct state-owned factories to outpace Britain, or regulation goes down so much that the British practices come to France, the Empire will have a rather problematic budget to deal with."

FRA_la_lumiere_directrice: "La Lumière Directrice"
FRA_la_lumiere_directrice_desc: "Napoleon III, is the guiding light of the Empire. Without him, there would be no Empire, perhaps even no Republic back in 1848. Without him, the woman would still have no hope of studying, and the Algerians would be gassed daily by the King's troops. This creates an extreme problem for the Empire however. While the Emperor is healthy and agile, the Eagle is sure to soar over the entire world. But when His Majesty is sick, unable to rule or give his own commands. . .then the Empire is left without it's head, and the many forces united behind the Emperor begin to squabble. The Empire has it's Alexander, it's Ceasar, it's Augustus or rather fittingly - it's Napoleon. But what will the Empire do without him? The Empire thus has a ticking clock, to which is tied a dagger right above it's head. Some solution must be found. Perhaps the solution is to ensure that His Majesty is not the biggest cog of the machine? Perhaps it is to ensure that only the Emperor's firmest remain? Maybe, a grand system of checks and balances to oversee all? Whatever it may be, a decision must be made. For god help us if the clock strikes twelve, and the Emperor is not there."
