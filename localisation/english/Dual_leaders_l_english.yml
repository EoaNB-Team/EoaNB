  ### TOKUGAWA SHOGUNATE - EMPEROR KOMEI ###

  JAP_characters_emperor_komei_desc: "§YHeadstrong§!\n§G+15%§! Political Power Gain\n§R-3%§! Stability\n\n§LKōmei, born Osahito, is the 121st Emperor of Japan. A staunch traditionalist, he has consistently opposed the opening of Japan to foreign powers and the unequal treaties signed by the Shogunate. Though his power is largely ceremonial under the Tokugawa regime, his views carry significant moral weight among those who wish to restore direct imperial rule.§!"
  
  ### UNITED KINGDOM - QUEEN VICTORIA ###

  ENG_desc_queen_vic: "§LVictoria has reigned over the United Kingdom since 1837, presiding over an era of unprecedented industrial, cultural, and imperial expansion. As constitutional monarch, she exercises influence through her ministers while embodying the prestige and stability of the British Crown across a vast global empire.§!"
  
  ### Greece - King Otto ###
  GRE_Otto: "Otto I"
  GRE_characters_otto_desc: "§YUnpopular Monarch§!\n§R-20§! Stability\n\n§LOtto, born Prince Otto Friedrich Ludwig of Bavaria, is the first King of Greece. Placed on the throne by the Great Powers at age seventeen, he arrived with Bavarian troops and advisors, earning his government the derisive label 'Bavarocracy.' A Catholic ruling an Orthodox nation, Otto styles himself an enlightened absolutist and has pursued modernization efforts, yet remains unable to win the genuine affection of his subjects. Neither ruthless enough to be feared nor compassionate enough to be loved, his reign depends entirely on the continued support of Britain, France, and Russia.§!"
  
  ### USA - Breckinridge ###
  USA_Breckinridge: "John C. Breckinridge"
  USA_characters_Breckinridge_desc: "§YStaunch Constitutionalist§!\n§G+0.5%§! Drift Defence\n\n§LJohn Cabell Breckinridge of Kentucky is the fourteenth and youngest Vice President in American history, assuming office at just thirty-six years of age. A scion of one of Kentucky's most distinguished political families and grandson of Thomas Jefferson's Attorney General, he carries an almost aristocratic bearing that commands respect across party lines. As President of the Senate, he presides with grace and impartiality, earning admiration even from political opponents. Yet his role is largely ceremonial—President Buchanan rarely seeks his counsel, and the Vice Presidency affords him no platform to voice his own views on the slavery question tearing the nation apart. A strict constructionist who believes the Constitution must be preserved at all costs, Breckinridge finds himself caught between Southern firebrands demanding secession and Northern abolitionists he views as equally dangerous to the Union. Whether he can thread this needle remains to be seen.§!" 
  
  ### Sardinia - Victor ###
  PIE_Victor: "Victor Emmanuel II"
  PIE_characters_Victor_desc: "§YAutocratic Imperialist§!\n§G+0.05%§! War Support\n§G+0.1%§! Stability\n\n§LVittorio Emanuele Maria Alberto Eugenio Ferdinando Tommaso di Savoia ascended to the throne of Sardinia-Piedmont in 1849 after his father Charles Albert's disastrous defeat at Novara and subsequent abdication. Where his father faltered, the son refused to yield—securing favorable armistice terms from the Austrians and, crucially, preserving the liberal Statuto Albertino when every other Italian constitution was swept away by reaction. A soldier-king more at home in the saddle than the salon, Victor Emmanuel possesses a blunt, even coarse manner that masks a shrewd political mind. His appointment of Count Cavour as Prime Minister has proven inspired, though the two frequently clash over the pace of action—the King forever pushing for war while his minister counsels patience. Veterans who fought beside him at Pastrengo, Goito, and Santa Lucia speak of his personal courage under fire. Now he watches and waits, dreaming of a unified Italy under the House of Savoy, preparing for the next war that will drive Austria from the peninsula forever. The Italians will come to call him §YPadre della Patria§!—Father of the Fatherland.§!"

  ### Austria - Franz Joseph I ###
  AUS_Franz_Joseph_I: "Franz Joseph I."
  AUS_characters_Franz_Joseph_desc: "§YFather of Nations§!\n - £stability_texticon Stability: §G+15%§!\n - £stability_texticon Weekly Stability: §G+0.01%§!\n - £political_violence_gain_texticon Resistance Growth Speed: §G-15%§!\n\n§LHistorical Context:\n-----\nHis rise to the throne:\nAfter his uncle, Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria has abdicated the throne in 1848, Franz Joseph was crowned Emperor just at the age of 18. The country was amidst of a great revolution (1848/49 Hungarian Revolution), started by the Hungarian nobility. By the leading hands of Franz Joseph, Austria came out victorious.\n\nCementing His Powers:\nNow that the Springtime of the Peoples has ended and the age of liberalism is over, his goal is to cement his power and to supress any revolutionary ideas. Although all of his efforts Austria is once again on the brink of collapse. Over the last few years secessionist ideas have resurfaced, mainly amongst the Italians in Lombardy-Venetia. After the financial crisis of the last decade, the Hungarians have also gathered courage to make a stand against Vienna. It's the Emperor's task to show an iron fist and triumph over our enemies.\n\nRelations with the Crownlands:\n-----\nKingdom of Hungary:\nAfter his crowning in 1848, he gained all the lands of the Empire, which would mean control over all of the lands, but according to Hungarian Law, the abdication would also need to be accepted by the Hungarian Diet. This means that the Emperor is not the legitimate king of Hungary. If Franz Joseph truly wants to cement his powers, he will need to solve the Hungarian problem, which can only be done by a coronation with the Crown of St.Stephen\n\nKingdom of Bohemia:\nSimilarly to Hungary, Franz Joseph was never really crowned the King of Bohemia, despite holding the title. After the Empire's victory over Hungary, an age of Absolutism began over the nationalities, making any aspiration of restoring their historical rights impossible. But one thing is certain, that Bohemians will fight against Vienna.\n\nKingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria:\nGalicia remained loyal during the revolutions of 1848/49, but the crownland is in a crisis now. Social inequalities are widened by the ruling local elite, and waves of poverty has hit the region. Another problem is the growing pan-Slavism and Russian influence, which can hinder our authority in the kingdom." 

  ### Hungary - I. Ferenc József ###
  HUN_Ferenc_Jozsef: "I. Ferenc József"
  HUN_characters_Ferenc_Jozsef_desc: "§YMagyarország Apostoli Királya (Apostolic King of Hungary)§!\n - £stability_texticon Stability: §G+10%§!\n - £pol_power Political Power Gain: §G+5%§!\n\n§LHistorical Context:\nBetween 1848 and 1867:\nFranz Joseph (Ferenc József in Hungarian) was proclaimed the Emperor in 1848 after his uncle, King Ferdinand V. abdicated the throne. According to Hungarian Law, the Crown of St.Stephen cannot be passed down by an abdication, it has to be supported by the Hungarian diet, meaning that his claim to the throne was illegitimate. After the Revolution of 1848/49 was defeated by Austria, the Hungarian nobility was willing to accept him if he recognises the April Laws of 1848, but he denied as that would have meant taking an oath to the Hungarians, and recognising Hungary as an independent state. He only accepted the offer after the defeat in the Brothers' War as his hands were tied.\n\nThe Compromise:\nAfter the Ausgleich he had no choice but to accept the coronation. His coronation took place in the Matthias Church. After the coronation day he could finally rule Hungary and the Realm of St.Stephen as the legitimate king.\n\nHis title, the Apostolic King:\nApostolic King, or Apostolic Majesty is a title used by the kings of Hungary. The origin of title can be traced back to St.Stephen. The legend of Hartvik says that Pope Sylvester II himself hailed St.Stephen as an Apostle of Christ, referring to his holy labours in spreading the Catholic faith in Hungary, by gifting him the apostolic cross. This meant that he could appoint Archbishops and organise the chruch in Hungary. Since then every Hungarian king hold the title. In our time, this title is mearly symbolic, but it bears almost a millenia of history and legends.§!"
