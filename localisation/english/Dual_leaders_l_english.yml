  ### TOKUGAWA SHOGUNATE - EMPEROR KOMEI ###
  JAP_komei: "Kōmei"
  JAP_characters_emperor_komei_desc: "§YHeadstrong§!\n§G+15%§! Political Power Gain\n§R-3%§! Stability\n\nKōmei, born Osahito, is the 121st Emperor of Japan. A staunch traditionalist, he has consistently opposed the opening of Japan to foreign powers and the unequal treaties signed by the Shogunate. Though his power is largely ceremonial under the Tokugawa regime, his views carry significant moral weight among those who wish to restore direct imperial rule."

  ### Greece - King Otto ###
  GRE_Otto: "Otto I"
  GRE_characters_otto_desc: "§YUnpopular Monarch§!\n§R-0.20§! Stability\n\nOtto, born Prince Otto Friedrich Ludwig of Bavaria, is the first King of Greece. Placed on the throne by the Great Powers at age seventeen, he arrived with Bavarian troops and advisors, earning his government the derisive label 'Bavarocracy.' A Catholic ruling an Orthodox nation, Otto styles himself an enlightened absolutist and has pursued modernization efforts, yet remains unable to win the genuine affection of his subjects. Neither ruthless enough to be feared nor compassionate enough to be loved, his reign depends entirely on the continued support of Britain, France, and Russia."
