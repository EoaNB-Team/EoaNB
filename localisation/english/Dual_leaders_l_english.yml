  ### TOKUGAWA SHOGUNATE - EMPEROR KOMEI ###
  JAP_komei: "Kōmei"
  JAP_characters_emperor_komei_desc: "§YHeadstrong§!\n§G+15%§! Political Power Gain\n§R-3%§! Stability\n\nKōmei, born Osahito, is the 121st Emperor of Japan. A staunch traditionalist, he has consistently opposed the opening of Japan to foreign powers and the unequal treaties signed by the Shogunate. Though his power is largely ceremonial under the Tokugawa regime, his views carry significant moral weight among those who wish to restore direct imperial rule."
  
  ### UNITED KINGDOM - QUEEN VICTORIA ###
  ENG_Victoria: "Victoria"
  ENG_desc_queen_vic: "Victoria has reigned over the United Kingdom since 1837, presiding over an era of unprecedented industrial, cultural, and imperial expansion. As constitutional monarch, she exercises influence through her ministers while embodying the prestige and stability of the British Crown across a vast global empire."
  
  ### Greece - King Otto ###
  GRE_Otto: "Otto I"
  GRE_characters_otto_desc: "§YUnpopular Monarch§!\n§R-20§! Stability\n\nOtto, born Prince Otto Friedrich Ludwig of Bavaria, is the first King of Greece. Placed on the throne by the Great Powers at age seventeen, he arrived with Bavarian troops and advisors, earning his government the derisive label 'Bavarocracy.' A Catholic ruling an Orthodox nation, Otto styles himself an enlightened absolutist and has pursued modernization efforts, yet remains unable to win the genuine affection of his subjects. Neither ruthless enough to be feared nor compassionate enough to be loved, his reign depends entirely on the continued support of Britain, France, and Russia."
  
  ### USA - Breckinridge ###
  USA_Breckinridge: "John C. Breckinridge"
  USA_characters_Breckinridge_desc: "§YStaunch Constitutionalist§!\n§G+0.5%§! Drift Defence\n\nJohn Cabell Breckinridge of Kentucky is the fourteenth and youngest Vice President in American history, assuming office at just thirty-six years of age. A scion of one of Kentucky's most distinguished political families and grandson of Thomas Jefferson's Attorney General, he carries an almost aristocratic bearing that commands respect across party lines. As President of the Senate, he presides with grace and impartiality, earning admiration even from political opponents. Yet his role is largely ceremonial—President Buchanan rarely seeks his counsel, and the Vice Presidency affords him no platform to voice his own views on the slavery question tearing the nation apart. A strict constructionist who believes the Constitution must be preserved at all costs, Breckinridge finds himself caught between Southern firebrands demanding secession and Northern abolitionists he views as equally dangerous to the Union. Whether he can thread this needle remains to be seen." 
  
  ### Sardinia - Victor ###
  PIE_Victor: "Victor Emmanuel II"
  PIE_characters_Victor_desc: "§YAutocratic Imperialist§!\n§G+0.05%§! War Support\n§G+0.1%§! Stability\n\nVittorio Emanuele Maria Alberto Eugenio Ferdinando Tommaso di Savoia ascended to the throne of Sardinia-Piedmont in 1849 after his father Charles Albert's disastrous defeat at Novara and subsequent abdication. Where his father faltered, the son refused to yield—securing favorable armistice terms from the Austrians and, crucially, preserving the liberal Statuto Albertino when every other Italian constitution was swept away by reaction. A soldier-king more at home in the saddle than the salon, Victor Emmanuel possesses a blunt, even coarse manner that masks a shrewd political mind. His appointment of Count Cavour as Prime Minister has proven inspired, though the two frequently clash over the pace of action—the King forever pushing for war while his minister counsels patience. Veterans who fought beside him at Pastrengo, Goito, and Santa Lucia speak of his personal courage under fire. Now he watches and waits, dreaming of a unified Italy under the House of Savoy, preparing for the next war that will drive Austria from the peninsula forever. The Italians will come to call him §YPadre della Patria§!—Father of the Fatherland."

  ### Austria - Franz Joseph I ###
  AUS_Franz_Joseph_I: "Franz Joseph I."
  AUS_characters_Franz_Joseph_desc: "§YFather of Nations§!\n - £stability_texticon Stability: §G+15%§!\n - £stability_texticon Weekly Stability: §G+0.01%§!\n - £political_violence_gain_texticon Resistance Growth Speed: §G-15%§!\n\nAfter his uncle, Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria has abdicated the throne in 1848, Franz Joseph was crowned Emperor just at the age of 18. The country was amidst a great revolution (1848/49 Hungarian Revolution), started by the Hungarian nobility. By the leading hands of Franz Joseph, Austria came out victorious. Now that the Springtime of the Peoples has ended and the age of liberalism is over, his goal is to cement his power and to supress any revolutionary ideas. Although all of his efforts the Austria is once again on the brink of collapse. Over the last few years secessionist ideas have resurfaced, mainly amongst the Italians in Lombardy-Venetia. After the financial crisis of the last decade, the Hungarians have also gathered courage to make a stand against Vienna. It's the Emperor's task to show an iron fist and triumph over our enemies."
