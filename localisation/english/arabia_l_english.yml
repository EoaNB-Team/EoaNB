 arab_events.74.d: "At 09:02 local time on the 27 of August, the newly crowned Sultan of Zanzibar, Khalid bin Barghash, had war declared upon him by [ENG.GetName]. \nKhalid had defied the British terms of Zanzibar succession, raised his personal guard and barricaded the palace, ignoring an ultimatum by the British.\n This had lead to the sinking of three ships and around 500 dead and wounded on the Zanzibar side. One unlucky British sailor managed to injure himself and is expected to make a full recovery. Over the 38 minutes it took for Khalid to surrender, the British ships had fired over 500 shells. \nBritish Naval officials appear very smug over the whole affair, apparently busy fining the new colony for the shells fired."
