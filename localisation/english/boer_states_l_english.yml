 boer_states.22.t: "National embarassment"
 boer_states.22.d: "Many see our in-action against Basotho as a embrassment to our nation. A technologically superior nation, unable to defeat some minor mountain tribes. Our enimies will look to this as a opportunity to expand their own influence into our territory."

 boer_states.31.b: "Too Risky"
 boer_states.32.t: "Diamonds Discovered In Cambell Lands"
 boer_states.32.d: "We have found ourselves confronted with a serious difficulty on the western border.

 boer_states.32.b: "Do nothing"
 boer_states.33.t: "Deepen integration"
 boer_states.33.d: "The adminstration we established over the diamond fields of Cambell Lands has been a complete failure. It is satisfactory neither to the Free State nor to the diggers. If we invest any further on this project, it is almost certainly going to end badly. On the other hand, if we give up, Britain will expand into the area."
 boer_states.33.a: "Give Up"
 boer_states.33.b: "Keep the land"
 boer_states.34.t: "Miners fight back"
 boer_states.34.d: "The miners is Cambell lands have rose up and declared the diggers republic. Our adminstration in the area has neglected its duties, depite our investment. We must now decide whether to give up on the land or let Britain move in and take over the area..."

 boer_states.35.t: "Digger Victory"

 boer_states.37.d: "Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, has been invited to stand for President in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, partly as a means to overcome the Basotho. "
 boer_states.37.a: "Great!"
 boer_states.38.t: "Force Pretorius to Step Down"
 boer_states.38.d: "The Transvaal constitution that he had just enacted made it illegal to hold office abroad. However, this does not stop Pretorius to be the President for the Orange Free State. Commandant-General Paul Kruger and others in the Transvaal government disliked Pretorius's unconstitutional dual presidency and worried that Britain might declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined. Pretorius was told by the Volksraad to choose between his two posts."
 boer_states.38.a: "Pretorius has Decided..."
 boer_states.39.t: "Pretorius steps down as OFS President"
 boer_states.39.d: "Pretorius has stepped down as President of the Orange Free State, we can now continue with our objectives."

 boer_states.40.t: "Pretorius steps down as President"
 boer_states.40.d: "Pretorius has stepped down as President of the Orange Free State, we must elect a new President to lead our nation."
 boer_states.40.a: "Sad News"
 boer_states.41.t: "Pretorius steps down as President"
 boer_states.41.d: "Pretorius has stepped down as President of the South African Republic, we must elect a new President to lead our nation. Johannes Hermanus Grobler has been appointed as President in the meantime."
 boer_states.41.a: "Sad News"
 boer_states.42.t: "Schoeman Attempts Coup"
 boer_states.42.d: "To the surprise of his supporters and detractors, he resigned as President of the Transvaal and continued in the Free State. With this and many in the Transvaal government dissapointed with the current President, Schoeman has used force to try and take the office of President for himself. However, Commandant-General Paul Kruger believes Schoeman can be persuaded to submit to the Volksraad. Schoeman is a strong leader, but his actions risk a civil war..."
 boer_states.42.a: "Persuade him to submit to a trial"
 boer_states.42.b: "Schoeman Remains as President"
 boer_states.43.t: "Schoeman Stars Civil War"
 boer_states.43.d: "After Schoeman unsuccessfully attempted to use force to supplant Grobler as acting president, Kruger persuaded him to submit to a volksraad hearing, where Schoeman was censured and relieved of his post. Willem Cornelis Janse van Rensburg was appointed acting president while a new election was organised for October 1862. Dissatisfied with the Volksraad decision to censure him, Schoeman has mustered a commando at Potchefstroom and is once again attempting to force his way into office."
 boer_states.43.a: "Muster our Commandos"
 boer_states.44.t: "Elections are Held Again"
 boer_states.44.d: "Knowing he was defeated Schoeman accepted negotiations held with Kruger and Pretorius, agreeing to hold a special court on the disturbances soon thereafter fresh elections for president and commandant-general. Schoeman was found guilty of rebellion against the state and banished. The election results were announced, with Van Rensburg becoming president and Kruger as commandant-general. Both expressed disappointment at the low turnout and resolved to hold another set of elections. The civil war led to an economic collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms. "
 boer_states.44.a: "Time to Rebuild"
 boer_states.45.t: "Pretorius Elected President in OFS"
 boer_states.45.d: "In late 1859, the president of Transvaal, Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, was invited to stand for President in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, partly as a means to overcome the Basotho. The Transvaal constitution that he had just enacted made it illegal to hold office abroad, but he readily did so and won. The Volksraad attempted to side-step the constitutional problems by granting Pretorius half-a-year of leave in the hope that a solution might come about, and the president duly left for Bloemfontein and appointed Johannes Hermanus Grobler to be acting president in his absence."
 boer_states.45.a: "Tick.. Tock..."
 boer_states.46.t: "OFS Request Unification Talks"
 boer_states.46.d: "Once Pretorius was sworn in as President of the Free State he had sent a deputation to Pretoria to negotiate union the next day. Should we agree to negoitate a union between our nations, this may lead to Britain declaring the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined."
 boer_states.46.a: "Accept"
 boer_states.46.b: "Decline"
 boer_states.47.t: "Talks Fail with Transvaal"
 boer_states.47.d: "Transvaal government disliked Pretorius's unconstitutional dual presidency and worried that Britain might declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined. Thus have refused any talks for unification."
 boer_states.47.a: "Shame"
 boer_states.48.t: "Talks Begin"
 boer_states.48.d: "Negotiations between our government and Transvaal have started to decide whether unification will be possible, there are likely to be some major points that will decide the fate of these talks..."
 boer_states.48.a: "Great News!"
 boer_states.49.t: "Economic Investment"
 boer_states.49.d: "The Orange Free State has made a resuest during the unification talks for increased economic investment in their lands. This is due to the belief that our state is the richer and more populace, as a result we have a greater economy than theirs. While aspects of this are true, we are not much better off than the OFS and this could cause some anger within our nation, taking away their hard earned money to give it to someone else..."
 boer_states.49.a: "Accept"
 boer_states.49.b: "Refuse"
 boer_states.50.t: "Break Off UK Relations"
 boer_states.50.d: "Transvaal has demanded that a unified Boer Republic would have no ties with Britain. However, many within the Orange Free State believe good relations with Britain are important and some even seek unification with the Cape Colony. Furthermore, this unification would make the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void which could lead Britain to have justification to declare war on us..."
 boer_states.50.a: "Accept"
 boer_states.50.b: "Refuse"
 boer_states.51.t: "Dealing With Basutoland"
 boer_states.51.d: "The Orange Free State have had numerous problems with the Natives of Basutoland. They have requested that if unification was to occur, that our combined forces are to deal with Basutoland once and for all... While this is doable, it is likely to anger Britain, especially if we annex too much territory. We could agree to these terms and later seek a peaceful solution, though this may anger some in the Orange Government."
 boer_states.51.a: "Accept"
 boer_states.51.b: "Refuse"
 boer_states.52.t: "New Capital"
 boer_states.52.d: "Transvaal has demanded that the capital of the new unified Boer Republic is to be Pretoria. While it is the larger city, it will anger some Conservatives who believe this is a sign of Transvaal attempting to force their will upon the people of the Orange Free State."
 boer_states.52.a: "Accept"
 boer_states.52.b: "Refuse"
 boer_states.53.t: "Unification Results..."
 boer_states.53.d: "Following the unification talks between representatives from both Boer Republics, they have returned home with a treaty. The Parliament is now debating on this treaty and will soon vote on whether to accept unification or not."
 boer_states.53.a: "The Results is..."
 boer_states.54.t: "Unification Succeeds"
 boer_states.54.d: "Both Boer Parliaments have voted and agreed upon the treaty to unify!"
 boer_states.54.a: "Great News!"
 boer_states.55.t: "Unification Fails"
 boer_states.55.d: "Both Boer Republics could not agree on how a Unified Republic would look"
 boer_states.55.a: "Shame"
 boer_states.56.t: "New National Flag?"
 boer_states.56.d: "Now that we have unifed into one United Boer Republic, a debate is being made in the new Volksraad on whether or not our nation should adopt a new flag. Three new proposals have been put forward, although many still believe our current flag should remain. What design should become our new national flag?"
 boer_states.56.a: "Design 1"
 boer_states.56.b: "Design 2"
 boer_states.56.c: "Design 3"
 boer_states.56.e: "Our Current Flag"
 boer_states.57.t: "Philippolis Abandoned"
 boer_states.57.d: "The Griqua people that have lived in Philippolis have finally migrated elsewhere. This now allows us to fully take control of the area and strengthen our southern border with the British."
 boer_states.57.a: "Move in"
 #boer_states.58.t: NOT NEEDED
 boer_states.59.t: "Lydenburg Joins the Republic"
 boer_states.59.d: "After years of independance, our fellow countrymen in Lydenburg have decided to join our great republic willingly. We our slowly unifying the region for our people!"
 boer_states.59.a: "Great news!"
 boer_states.60.t: "Sir Theophilus Shepstone"
 boer_states.60.d: "Shepstone has arrived in Pretoria and issued a proclamation announcing the establishment of British authority over the Transvaal. Shepstone's force consisted of twenty-five men of the Natal Mounted Police only, but no overt opposition was made to the annexation as the republic is in a condition bordering on anarchy."
 boer_states.60.a: "Worrying"
 boer_states.61.t: "Diplomats in London"
 boer_states.61.d: "In an attempt to avoid a war, a delegation was sent to London to protest the illeagal occupation of our homeland. However, this diplomacy did not have the desired effect and our pleas fell on deaf ears. It is becoming increasingly likely that a war will break out."
 boer_states.61.a: "Worrying"
 boer_states.62.t: "British Rule in South Africa"
 boer_states.62.d: "Transvaal has failed to resist British occupation and it seems unlikely that we will be able to resist a Confederation imposed upon us by London. We have recieved an invitation by the Cape Colony to join a South African Confederation, many within our government see little point in refusing... it would lead to unnecessary bloodshed."
 boer_states.62.a: "End of the Free State"
 boer_states.63.t: "South African Union"
 boer_states.63.d: "Through the strong leadership of Prime Minister Molteno in the Cape Colony, the likelihood an South African Union has become the greatest it has ever been. The Prime Minister has put forward a fair plan that sees all parties take an equal stake. While our nation and people would come under British rule, which many see as undesirable, the new South African Union would have many freedom akin to Canada. There is little opposistion to this plan and the Volksraad will approve the treaty."
 boer_states.63.a: "Great News"
 boer_states.64.t: "South African Union"
 boer_states.64.d: "Through the strong leadership of Prime Minister Molteno in the Cape Colony, the likelihood an South African Union has become the greatest it has ever been. The Prime Minister has put forward a fair plan that sees all parties take an equal stake.
