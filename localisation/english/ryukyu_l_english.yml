 ryukyu.3.t: "Gift From The [FROM.GetName]"
 ryukyu.3.d: "As time passes, more European powers appear to be deeply captivated with the task of spreading their customs, culture, and religion to our great kingdom. Ever since we "opened" to the United States, other powers such as France and the United Kingdom soon followed. Many misstions were created in our great kingdom to expand their influence amoungst our people. Although incidents did  occur, they did little to stop our growing relations between us. One example in particular would be the French misstion in Naha. We had always had a strong relationship with the French and somehow they never fail to deliver. Out of the goodness of their hearts, we have been gifted many pieces of field artillery."

 RYU_the_veil_of_independance_desc: "Though technically under the control of Satsuma, Ryukyu was given a great degree of autonomy. To best serve the interests of the Satsuma daimyo and the shogunate, an emphasis on trade with China was instated. Ryukyu was a tributary state of China, and since Japan had no formal diplomatic relations with China, it was essential that China not realize that Ryukyu was controlled by Japan. Thus, Satsuma—and the shogunate—were obliged to be mostly hands-off in terms of not visibly or forcibly occupying Ryukyu or controlling the policies and laws there."

Outrageously the young Sho Tai decided to desecrated his honor by refusing to renew the same oath his ancestors had continued to swear since 1611!"
 ryukyu.23.a: "Revoke Sho Tai of Authority! The loyal Sanshikan Council will rule!"

 ryukyu.24.d: "Shimazu Nariakira, the former Satsuma Lord, has died several days ago. Nariakira was succeeded by the young daimyo named Shimazu Tadayoshi. Though ultimately Tadayoshi's father, Shimazu Hisamitsu, now holds most of the political power as regent of the Satsuma Domain. Hisamitsu has redacted Ryukyu's permission to interact with the West, which his half-brother, Nariakira, had formerly allowed. His new policies would expel all missionaries and make it punishable by death if Ryukyuans convert to christianity. All western trade has been consequently banned from accessing the [RYU.GetName]. This has closed a loop hole that allowed chinese and western goods to be smuggled into the [SAT.GetName].\n\nThe [RYU.GetName]'s king, Sho Tai, had been requested to appear before Shimazu Hisamitsu himself to renew his oath to loyalty to the Shimazu Clan. As expected, the honorful Sho Tai has renewed the oath that his ancestors had continued to swear since 1611."

Nariakira has instructed the Sanshikan Council, the Ryukyu Kingdom's shadow government, to remove Sho Tai from power. Luckily Sho loyalist forces have escorted Sho Tai into exile for safety.\n\nThe Sanshikan Council has hired shinobi to hunt down the location of Sho Tai and his loyalist forces. This leaves a limited amount of time to initiate a coup to restore Sho Tai's power. Should we pursue the Sho's coup or accept the council's authority?"
