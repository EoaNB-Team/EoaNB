event_papacy.214.d: "In 1863, Giuseppe Fiorelli took charge of the excavations at Pompeii, ushering in a new era of archaeological methodology. Departing from the previous treasure-hunting practices, Fiorelli introduced a systematic approach to uncovering the ancient city. His most remarkable innovation was the use of plaster to fill the voids left by decomposed bodies in the ash, creating eerily lifelike casts of Pompeii’s residents in their final moments. This breakthrough has not only preserved these poignant details for posterity but has also provided unprecedented insights into the lives of those who perished in the eruption. Fiorelli's work promises to transform our understanding of Pompeii and Roman life in general."
