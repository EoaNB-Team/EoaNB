event_papacy.214.d: "In 1863, Giuseppe Fiorelli assumed responsibility for the excavations at Pompeii, marking a turning point in archaeological practice.\n\nDeparting from earlier treasure-hunting methods, Fiorelli introduced a systematic and scientific approach. His most notable innovation was the use of plaster to fill the voids left by decomposed bodies in the volcanic ash, producing remarkably lifelike casts of the city’s residents in their final moments.\n\nThis method preserves these poignant details for posterity and provides unprecedented insights into the daily lives of Pompeii’s inhabitants. Fiorelli’s work is set to transform our understanding of the ancient city and Roman society as a whole."

### Ideas ###
PAP_idea_The_Holy_See: "The Holy See"
PAP_idea_The_Holy_See_desc: "The Holy See is the central governing body of the Catholic Church and the Papal States at the Vatican. It encompasses the office of the pope as the bishop of the apostolic episcopal see of Rome, and serves as the spiritual and administrative authority of Catholicism. With millions of Catholics in various countries around the globe, the Holy See wields significant diplomatic and societal influence and cannot be ignored easily."
PAP_vic_idea_Cholera: "Cholera"
PAP_vic_idea_Cholera_desc: "The specter of cholera haunts our cities and countryside alike, exposing the cracks in our public health, sanitation, and governance. Streets run with fear as much as filth, and trust in our institutions erodes with each buried victim. While the Holy See struggles to contain the outbreak, dissent festers, and the call for reform grows louder than the church bells tolling for the dead."
PAP_vic_idea_Failing_Finances: "Failing Finances"
PAP_vic_idea_Failing_Finances_desc: "The Papal State struggles to maintain solvency as administrative inefficiency, corruption, and a shrinking tax base drain its coffers. Military upkeep, infrastructure neglect, and costly foreign entanglements only worsen the situation, leaving the state heavily reliant on foreign loans and the goodwill of Catholic powers. Without reform, financial collapse looms ever closer."
PAP_vic_idea_Memories_Roman_Republic: "Memories of Roman Republic" 
PAP_vic_idea_Memories_Roman_Republic_desc: "The brief experiment of the Roman Republic left a lasting mark on the people and the Papacy alike. While its leaders were driven into exile, their ideals of liberty and national unity continue to inspire radicals and reformists. For the Church, the memory of that upheaval is a constant reminder of how fragile its temporal rule truly is."
dynmod_PAP_army: "Esercito dello Stato Pontificio"
dynmod_PAP_army_desc: "The Papal Army, though small and fragmented, serves as the shield of the Holy Father’s temporal power. Composed of loyal Italians, mercenaries, and foreign volunteers, it stands as a symbol of faith and authority, but suffers from outdated organization and uncertain discipline."

POLITICS_PIUS_XI_DESC: "Both spiritual shepherd and temporal ruler, Pius IX guides the Papal State through an era of upheaval. Once seen as a reformer, he now stands wary of liberalism and revolution, determined to defend the Church’s authority against the tides of nationalism. Revered by the faithful yet opposed by radicals, his rule embodies the delicate balance between divine mission and earthly power."
