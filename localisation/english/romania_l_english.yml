In 1848, the age of revolutions, a revolutionary government was defeated by the Ottomans and the monarchy was reinstaurated. The last prince of Wallachia, Barbu Ştirbey, named for 7 years(from 1849 to 1856) ended his reign exactly at the end of the Crimean War, and the Ottomans rejected a longer reign due to his unionist sentiment, a sentiment the people also have.

His concerns about the electoral fraud that had taken place in Moldavia by Nicolae Vogoride had left him stressed and weary, to be followed up later by his disenchantment with Emperor Napoleon III and his empire due to his refusal to give him an audience, which only worsened the prince's situation. Searches of his courters found that he committed suicide with his personal hunting rifle. Across his desk is his will, where a candle still lies lit, his final words scribed across the piece of parchment: "I am the victim of a foul deed and cannot live any longer, although I know myself to be completely innocent.

 rom_wallachia.1.d: "As expected the strategical position of Wallachia on the Balakans, brought on the Russian fury during the Crimean War of 1856 which devistated the already fledging agriculture based economy of the state. In 1857, Wallachia now stand on a continental crossroad, between -The Russian Empire, The Austrian Empire and The Ottoman Empire. Wallachia's ambition to unite the romanian people, long divided since the dawn of the 15th centry, is greatly hindered by it's overlord -The Ottoman Empire, always trying to strenghten it's grip on it's balkan holdings, however one by one, they're all slipping away. If Wallachia ever wishes to unite the state of Romania it will have to lick it's wounds and prepare itself and it's people for hopefully the upcoming elections, which shall decide if the divide between the people of Romania shall finally be mended..."

Of course, the constant wars between Russians and the Turks have been hurting our progress but we have been able to rebuild again and again. This time, the Crimean War has turned the agricultural situation upside down once more which means we need to start again to rebuild our agriculture else the system which has kept us alive for so long will finally take us down with it."

A direct successor of the "Pruncul Roman" newspaper, this newspaper promotes the radical takeover of Wallachia and Moldavia in order to unify the two principalities. The newspaper has direct connection with the radical ideology in Western Europe, it would be advised to crack down on them to avoid more problem as leaving them unchecked would mean possible increased revolutionary activity."

The new nation of Romania must rid itself of its undemocratic past to ensure a righteous future, although this will clearly cause unrest among the members of the assembly, and most of it will be directed against Cuza himself, who has led the call for reform. "
 ROM_rule_by_decree: "Rule by Decree"
 ROM_rule_by_decree_desc: "To ensure the stability of our new nation, perhaps it would be wise to enact greater powers for our Domnitor, who will certainly rule with righteousness. This would be a much preferable option than trusting a parliament chamber full of dubious politicians, who may turn out to be rotten. This action, however, could be seen as undemocratic, a move against the more liberal parties in our nation, who would certainly have something to say about all this. No matter what comes, it is the only way to ensure Romania goes along the right path."
 ROM_oppose_authoritarianism: "Oppose Authoritarianism"
 ROM_oppose_authoritarianism_desc: "Romania is a young nation, a nation of quick changes and new ideas. Such ideas are, for example, the opposition to the old system of Absolute Governance which seems to plague the insides of all of our neighbors. In the same way Sisyphus is forced to carry his stone forever, Authoritarianism keeps countries in place, stuck from ever progressing. To become the greatest version of ourselves we must rid ourselves of the stone; we must liberalize, and we must do so quickly!"
 ROM_cuza_reforms: "Cuza's Reforms"
 ROM_cuza_reforms_desc: "The achievement of a better Romania is the goal, however, the paths that will eventually get us there are blurry; furthermore, there is a lot to do in the immediate future. Romania’s status as a new nation means reforms, plenty of those, and Alexandru Ioan Cuza must lead them to ensure they pass unchallenged. A task comparable to Heracles’ Twelve Labors, much like Heracles, Cuza must tackle them one by one. "
 ROM_education_reform: "Education Reform"
 ROM_education_reform_desc: "The younger generations, most of whom were born under the flag of a unified Romania, must have greater access to science than previous generations. They must learn the law and what makes us Romanian; things that bring our nation forward. To ensure the minds of tomorrow is to ensure a bright future."
 ROM_merge_court_system: "Merge the Court Systems"
 ROM_merge_court_system_desc: "A complicated court system is a ticking bomb in the hands of our enemies on the inside. Tedious bureaucracy never solved anything, and it is Alexandru Ioan Cuza’s duty to ensure that a unified Romanian court is established as a means of stable decision-making."
 ROM_fiscal_reform: "Fiscal Reform"
 ROM_fiscal_reform_desc: "To ensure Romania runs efficiently, and everyone pays their due fare, Alexandru Ioan Cuza must lead the fiscal reform of our country. No longer will the Boyar Oligarchies evade the law and no longer will foreign merchants export our goods without a greater scrutiny. First though, the Government must approve the passing of the new laws, and who knows where the loyalties of many politicians lie…"
 ROM_bucharest_university: "The Opening of the Bucharest University"
 ROM_bucharest_university_desc: "A great achievement to behold, having a university in our capital would boost our prestige in the eyes of our neighbors and would mean great pride for our people. Having access to higher-level studies is also beneficial for the state, who could surely put young and well trained bureaucrats to work."
 ROM_fight_illiteracy: "Fight Illiteracy"
 ROM_fight_illiteracy_desc: "A thorn in the sides of Romanian pride, literacy rates have never been high in either Wallachia or Moldavia. The citizens, mostly the rural folks, don’t know how to write or read, and are thus unable to benefit from the new technologies that are arriving quickly to our border. To remain illiterate is to stay behind, and Alexandru Ioan Cuza mustn’t accept that!"
 ROM_justice_reform: "Justice Reform"
 ROM_justice_reform_desc: "Having been under different penal codes for centuries, and in an attempt to liberalize the country, we should reform our justice system to root out inequalities brought from old times. From establishing new laws to changing the penal code, every step we take must be done under great scrutiny, to avoid future confusion and to ensure no loopholes are left unpatched."
 ROM_civil_penal_code: "Civil Penal Code"
 ROM_civil_penal_code_desc: "As the last step of the Justice Reform, Alexandru Ioan Cuza has ordered a new Civil Penal Code be made. In the Principality of Romania there must be no Kangaroo Courts. Although… What’s a Kangaroo?"
 ROM_new_post_service: "New Romanian Post Service"
 ROM_new_post_service_desc: "Postage is becoming ever increasingly important in this modern age, with goods and especially mail being carried from further away to even more remote locations than one would expect. Romania must be ready for the future; a future where its people are more and more connected, and where information can be transported at greater speeds."
 ROM_new_agrarian_reform: "New Agrarian Reform"
 ROM_new_agrarian_reform_desc: "Romania is a land blessed by God with fertile terrain. From Craiova to Iasi, there’s miles upon miles of open fields, busy being worked upon by our people. It is imperative that we ensure what’s best for those who represent the backbone of the Romanian nation. A new reform would bring forth better minimum conditions and plenty of support would pour from the cities into the countryside."
 ROM_monstrous_coalition: "The Monstrous Coalition"
 ROM_monstrous_coalition_desc: "Alarmed by Alexandru Ioan Cuza’s sweeping reforms, which have done nothing but increase his popularity among the peasantry, those in the government have begun to fear that they will soon be sidelined and Romania turned into an Autocracy like the times of old. To avoid this uncertain future, they have united their otherwise unmixable interests to fight the Domnitor."
 ROM_fight_inevitable: "Fight the Inevitable"
 ROM_fight_inevitable_desc: "A wise man performing a dangerous job, Prince Cuza knows when peril is knocking on his door. With rumors of a coup being planned and with ever increasing tension in the streets, he has no other option but to fight fire with fire; and he’s got plenty of matches left to light before he runs out."
 ROM_cuza_on_top: "Cuza on Top"
 ROM_cuza_on_top_desc: "As expected from the Nationmaker, Alexandru Ioan Cuza has managed to quiet down the peasant rabble that threatened Romania from the inside. With all who dared oppose him sidelined or removed from power, only those who truly believe in the cause of a free Romania remain as Cuza’s allies. This can surely only mean that a bright future is ahead of us all!"
 ROM_abdication: "Abdication"
 ROM_abdication_desc: "Dark clouds loom in the horizon for Romania. With all his options gone, Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza clearly has seen the writings on the wall. It’s a matter of time before he gives up and abdicates power; creating a power vacuum that will surely not calm the unrest."
