Our small nation, with a fittingly small number of soldiers needs every advantage it can acquire, and modern rifles are among the most important.

He will return home to France, and we will appoint Blaznavac as his successor. Blaznavac has had an unsteady relationship with the royal family, but he has been returned into their favor, and his connections to the royal family combined with his respectable military career make him our choice for war minister."

His plan centers on our forces' assault towards the southeast towards Niš and the main contingent of the Ottoman forces. This plan involves the total destruction of the Ottoman forces, to grant our army free reign afterwards to conquer any areas we desire.

These efforts should guard us against retaliation, and grant us loyal allies for the future.

Born in 1787, Vuk collected and preserved numerous Serbian songs, riddles, and fairy tales. He reformed the Serbian language, replacing primitive signs and letters unsuitable for common speech with six Cyrillic letters to simplify the Serbian language. From translating the New Testament to introducing rich terminology on body parts into literary language, his dedication to language reform is unquestionable. Besides his literary achievements, Vuk also contributed to Serbian anthology in combination with the ethnography of the time. Most importantly, he provided his interpretation of the connection between the environment and its inhabitants, ranging from nourishment to funeral customs. In conclusion, the man is quite influential for the nation, and his death could very well become a legacy transcending mere time."

During the revolutionary events and revolts of 1848, the number of gendarmerie units grew rapidly and their territorial organization developed. Police formations quickly became an important factor in the political life of the countries.\nOn this date, by decree of knyaz Mihajlo, a gendarmerie is established with the primary responsibility of maintaining public order and peace in Belgrade.

Both emigrants and revolutionaries from Bulgaria itself responded to his appeal. By June 1862, between 80 and 95 and according to some accounts up to 600 volunteers were gathered in Belgrade. The detachment was given the name "Legion" in early June 1862, when it took part in the armed clashes with the Turks at Varoš kapija and Vidin kapija in Belgrade. Subsequently, it defended a section of the Serbian positions in the city, and some of the Bulgarian volunteers were sent to Kragujevac, led by Ilyo Markov. However, the failure of the Hadjistavreva Buna interrupted plans for an uprising in Bulgaria. Theft of the funds raised and unsuccessful negotiations for funding from the Bulgarian communities in Braila and Vienna left the legion with very few weapons and forced it to go on Serbian state maintenance at the end of August."

    SERmisc.17.t: "Commercial Code of 1860"
    SERmisc.17.d: "The adoption of the Commercial Code is an important step in the development of the codification of the commercial law in the Serbia. This process can be conventionally divided into two stages. This phase of the process took place between 1849 and 1860. Its first phase, which lasted from 1849 to 1853, was initiated by the Ministry of Finance. In 1851, a commission composed of civil servants and Belgrade merchants drafted a commercial code. Although the legislature, the Council of State, initially approved the codification, it rejected the draft in 1853 on the grounds that the text did not contain the matter of commercial courts, that the Serbian people, being poorly educated, would not be able to understand the complex concepts of the commercial code, and that Serbian merchants were not ripe for a codified commercial law. The Commercial Committee, an organisation founded in January 1856 to propose measures to promote trade in Serbia, pushed for the introduction of a commercial code the same year. In early 1857, the Council formed a committee charged with revising the 1851 draft and preparing drafts on the organization of commercial courts and judicial procedure in commercial matters; all three texts were to become part of the commercial code. The draft was sent to the Commercial Committee on 14 February 1859, which returned it to the Ministry with its observations on 8 October of that year. On 24 November 1859, after the three-member committee set up by the Ministry of Justice had made some changes to the draft, the corrected version was sent to the Prince. The Commercial Code received the sanction of the Prince on 22 December 1859 and entered into force on 26 January 1860, thus making Serbia one of the countries with codified commercial law. The reason for the codification undoubtedly lay in the trade between merchants from Belgrade and those from Austria, which increased after the Revolution of 1848. In these commercial relations, Austrian merchants used bills of exchange as collateral, which meant that their Belgrade counterparts had to be as precise as possible in fulfilling their contractual obligations. However, due to the lack of commercial regulations and the long-standing civil procedure before the Serbian courts, the merchants from the capital were unable to realise their own claims against the debtors from the province, and consequently could not collect money to settle their own debts. For this reason, from 1852 onwards, Belgrade merchants applied for the adoption of a commercial code. Their petitions had more and more signatories, which may mean that the problem was steadily becoming more serious. However, it was not until the late 1850s, when the lack of a commercial code became noticeable in the province, that the code was introduced."

Parallel to this development, new Europeanised types of buildings are beginning to appear in Belgrade, distinguishing themselves from traditional architecture.\nOne example of the architectural progression in the Serbian state is the Captain Miša building. The building was constructed over a period of five years with the help of the Czech architect Jan Nevole. The wealth of decorative elements on the facades, the origins of which can be traced back to the Byzantine, Gothic and early Renaissance architectural sources, arouse the admiration of the citizens of Belgrade, calling the building the "Venetian Palace". On the other hand, the sculptures "Apollo with a lyre" and "Minerva with a spear and a shield", their thematic and symbolic meaning hint at the artistic, educational and scientific purpose for which the building was intended during its construction."

The education of Serbian boys and young men was free, as Sima Andreevich provided secure sources of income for the school's work and other needs. All teaching aids and textbooks, as well as school supplies, were provided. The school was known as the Prizren Theological Seminary, although its teaching character was extremely important.

Eventually, Prince Miloš Obrenović decided to introduce some order by establishing exchange rates based on the groat as money of account. In 1819 Miloš published a table rating 43 different foreign coins, 10 gold, 28 silver, and 5 copper. After the last Ottoman garrisons were withdrawn in 1867, Serbia was faced with multiple currencies in circulation. Thus, the prince Mihailo Obrenović ordered a national currency to be minted.

    SERmisc.33.d: "Jews have a long history in Serbian lands. Jews first arrived in the territory of present-day Serbia in Roman times, although there is little documentation prior to the 10th century. Jewish communities in the Balkans grew significantly in the 15th and 16th centuries when refugees fleeing the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal arrived there. Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II accepted Jewish refugees into his empire. Jews were most often merchants, especially important for the salt trade. Serbs and Jews generally had good relations, and Jewish merchants maintained trade routes in the empire. Beginning in 1804, the Serbs started a struggle for independence from the Turks. Many Jews supplied the Serbs with weapons, and the Turks treated them brutally. The Serbian government was mostly benevolent towards the Jews. However, in 1839, Jews were forbidden to open shops on Sundays and during Serbian holidays, causing them great damage because their shops were closed on Saturdays and all Jewish holidays. Under the rule of Miloš Obrenović, the Belgrade Jewish community issued its own money. Prince Mihailo Obrenović took power in 1861 and introduced anti-Jewish restrictions. In the early 1860s, a part of Serbian newspaper began publishing anti-Jewish articles resulting in threats being raised against the Jews. This attitude towards Jews stems from the historical context in which anti-Semitism flared up in Europe and the USA in the middle of the 19th century, which resulted in the expulsion and pogroms of Jewish life."

    SER_politics.30.d: "Since its emergence on the political map of Europe, Serbia has had a predominantly authoritarian-conservative character in terms of politics. Many of the politics and its bureaucratic foundations were derived from Garashanin and Vučić's childhood idol, the autocrat Francis I, emperor of Austria and Hungary from 1792 to 1806. Both believed strongly in creating an educational system and free elections.\nThe Defenders of the Constitution advocated a constitutional limitation of the Obrenović power and adherence to the 1838 Constitution. In 1839, they deposed Prince Miloš Obrenović, and in 1842, they forced his son Michael to abdicate the throne as well. They proclaimed Alexander Karadjordjevic as the new prince. During the reign of the Defenders of the Constitution, Serbia was abandoning its orientation towards Russia, and became closer to Austria, from which it had become economically dependent. The police-bureaucratic nature of the state was strengthened, the Assembly was almost never assembled, and the economic situation of the country sharply deteriorated. At the same time, for the first time, the principles of a new foreign policy were formulated, aimed at the unification of all the southern Slavs under the rule of the Serbian Duchy. This program was formulated in 1844 by Minister of Internal Affairs, Ilja Garasanin, in his work "The Outline" and envisaged the creation, by military means, of Great Serbia on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire."

Into this crowd came a quarrel, and the water tank of a Turkish soldier was broken. Then an angry Turkish soldier smashed the head of a Serbian boy, Sava Petrovic, with a prod and beat him to death. Nearby Serbs and Turks, as well as several Serbian gendarmes, immediately arrived at the scene. Turkish soldiers tried to escape, but the Gendarmeries detained them and called the police chief Mihajlo Barlovac. Barlovac sent several more policemen to the scene along with the interpreter Simo Nesic. The Turkish soldiers involved in the incident were afraid that the civilians who arrived at the scene would beat them. They were taken to the Serbian police under guard, and the wounded apprentice was sent home. While passing by their barracks, i.e. Turkish police buildings, the Turkish soldiers tried to escape, but were stopped by Sima Nesic and Gendarme George Nishli. Turkish soldiers then fired from the barracks, killing Simo Nesic and mortally wounding George Nisli. Others then fired...."

He had only about 200 to 250 gendarmes and a night guard of 550 soldiers and about 2,000 yarls, local armed Turks in the city itself. Immediately after the shooting, a general alarm was raised in Belgrade. The Turks barricaded themselves in all four city gates, in taverns and mosques. The Serbs, in turn, set out to arm themselves and occupy the Turkish gates. The Turkish Pasha then dispatched a strong force from the fortress and sent it to the Turkish barracks. Apparently, they were to attack the Serbian police and the charshiya. Prime Minister Ilija Garashanin detected the unit and since there were armed saints around, he persuaded them to return, guaranteeing their safe return. Along with them, he sent some Serbian Gendarmeries. However, there was a commotion in the city itself and the people were outraged by the Turks, and besides, the saint was encouraged by Joka Vlajkovic. On the return of the Turkish unit, someone in the crowd killed a Turkish officer, a company commander. Then the Turkish soldiers shot and killed several Serbs. "

After capturing the three gates, the Turks remained comforted in the Stambol Gate. Nikola Christo ordered the Varosh Gate and the Sawa Gate to be razed to the ground overnight. Tekiyas and mosques were also captured, some by negotiation. Many Turks attempted to capture the Belgrade fortresses with their families in turmoil.

However, an even greater crisis occurred and the ceasefire was broken on Tuesday, June, when the Turks began a several-hour bombardment of Belgrade with a cannon march after the solemn funeral of the dead. On this occasion the roof of the Metropolitan Church, the bell tower of the Cathedral and the Captain Mishino building were damaged. The Italian Consulate "Serbian Crown", where the French Consul was living at the time, was also affected. Later the city government found that as many as 396 houses had been hit and that fifty Serbs had been killed. Most of the consuls, except the Austrian, sided with the Serbs, believing that they gave no grounds for bombing. The Serbian Government used this event to demand the expulsion of the Turks from Serbia, but at a conference of the guaranteeing powers in the Constantinople suburb of Kalanca, held in July, it was decided to expel only Turkish civilians and to retain the Turkish urban garrisons.

    SER_politics.1.d: "After the growing hostility against the prince, he had no choice but to meet the demands of the opposition. On the 30th of November, 1858 in Belgrade, the Saint Andrews Assembly was convened. After the Members had been seated, the Secretaries took their places in the upper part of the Chamber, under the Chair tables. At the same time, three priest-deputies consecrated the hall. Shortly thereafter the members of the Council, led by Tom Vucic Perisic, entered the assembly. Knyaz Alexander came accompanied by ministers and his retinue. The Knyaz addressed the assembly with "God help me, Lord", and the assembly responded with "God help you, Lord". The knyaz then announces to the congregation that his leader will read her the prepared sermon. The sermon was read by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ljubomir Petrovich. After reading the sermon, the knyaz declared the assembly open, and withdrew, accompanied by ministers and the world. The Assembly decided that the Prince should resign. A letter was written to the knyaz in which the Assembly, on behalf of the people, asked the Prince to resign the dignity of Prince of Serbia and to hand over his power to the National Assembly. ". . . The National Assembly hopes," the letter reads, "that your Majesty will respect this voice of your people, and for the love of the happiness, peace and tranquillity of our and your fatherland, will voluntarily renounce the Government, so that in 1842 . The National Assembly has handed over the government to you, so that you, the Holy Prince, may return it to the Assembly and through it to the people... "Together with this letter was enclosed the resignation which the Prince was to sign, and both acts were taken to court by a deputation of the Assembly headed by him. The Prince accepted the deputation and asked to come tomorrow morning after his resignation. That evening, however, the knyaz , accompanied by Ilija Garashanin, left for the city of Belgrade, and the assembly, without waiting for his written resignation, excluded him by one decision from the princely dignity. That's the first time in 16 years, the political order changes with strong opposition againt Karadjordjevic."

In the course of this revolution, the Defenders of the Constitution were forced to liberalize the regime somewhat. In 1848, the powers of the Assembly were extended, all direct taxpayers received the right to vote. During the Crimean War, the Serbian government remained neutral, and under the terms of the Peace of Paris in 1856, the principality's autonomy was extended and secured by guarantees from the great powers. In the late 1850s, the economic crisis exacerbated relations between the charterers and the prince, which was accompanied by the rise of the liberal opposition. Under its pressure, it is now up to the Saint Andrews Assembly, to limit in a way the prerogatives of the State Council and transfer the entirety of legislative power to the Skupshchina. And it's still unclear whether knyaz Alexander Karadjordjevic will be ousted. Will this bring about the demise for the Defenders of the Constitution?"

By that law, the deadline was set for the Malogospojinska Assembly. In order to be able to finish the unfinished business and proposals that were submitted and adopted at the St. Andrew's Assembly, a special assembly committee was appointed before its dissolution, which was given the duty of reviewing, classifying, and presenting all the remaining material to the Council with its opinion, as the legislative authority, for further study and procedure. Before the meeting of the assembly, elections were held throughout the country, according to the regulations of the law passed by the National Assembly of Saint Andrew. The people who participated in the work of the St. Andrew's Assembly were elected. In this assembly, there are no more members of the Council, nor "people's elders" from earlier assemblies, district and county chiefs and judges entered by position and not by election.

    SER_politics.38.d: "From 1848 to 1850, Croatia was governed by the Ban's Council, appointed by the Ban and the Parliament or the Croatian-Slavonian Diet. In 1850, the Ban's Council was transformed into Ban's Government which, after the introduction of the absolutism, was under the direct control of the Austrian Imperial Government in Vienna. From 1854 to 1861, the Imperial-Royal Croatian-Slavonian Lieutenancy in Zagreb, under the Austrian Ministry of Interior, was the main governing body of the Croatian-Slavonian crown land. After the fall of Bach's absolutism in 1860 and 1861, the Royal Croatian-Slavonian Court Chancellery in Vienna - from 1861 to 1862 and the Croatian-Slavonian-Dalmatian Royal Council of Lieutenancy in Zagreb were founded.\nBan Jelačić had succeeded in the abolition of serfdom in Croatia, which eventually brought about massive changes in society: the power of the major landowners was reduced and arable land became increasingly subdivided, to the extent of risking famine. Many Croatians started emigrating to the New World countries in this period, a trend that would continue throughout the next hundred years and create a large Croatian diaspora.\nThe Illyrian movement was rather broad in scope, both nationalist and pan-Slavist. The Serbian government maintains close relations with the People's Party in Croatia and Slavonia, a neo-Islamic party led by Catholic Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer. It would eventually develop into two major causes: Garasanin fought for the idea of a Yugoslavia, dominated by Serbia, and supported cooperation with the Croats.\nMatija Mrazovic is in charge of foreign affairs for the People's Party. In his correspondence with Strossmayer, he often discusses the treaty between the Serbian government and the People's Party without explaining its nature or date. This treaty is apparently signed in the autumn of 1866. The most important aim of this treaty and its main task, is the conquest of Ottoman Bosnia by Serbia, as the first step in the establishment of an independent South Slav state. Mrazovic believed that Serbia could not survive as an independent state if Austria-Hungary conquered Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Ottomans."

In August 1842, their confrontation developed into an open rebellion led by Toma Vucic Perisic. Michael was forced to flee across the Sava into Austrian territory.\nMichael Obrenović spent the next 16 years in exile in Vienna and on his ancestral estates in Wallachia. In 1853, he married the Hungarian Countess Julia Hunyadi. He returned to Serbia after Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjevic was deposed at the end of 1858.

Russia, the ruling Ottoman Empire, and Austria, which was nearby, all opposed the move. The Sretenje Constitution is thought to have been a threat to the three great empires' own autocratic systems of rule. Particularly mocked by Metternich's Austria was the fact that Serbia had its own flag and foreign ministry. Milos was pleased to revoke the Sretenje Constitution at Russia and Turkey's request.\nAfter the Sretenje Constitution was abolished, knyaz Milos Obrenovic changed the way he ruled. He ceased serving as the supreme court's chief justice and ended the salt industry's monopoly. The Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, and Austrian Empire all upheld the Constitution of 1838. The "basis" for Serbia's constitutional structure was delivered by the Russian representative. He argued that the constitution should only contain administrative provisions because the Principality of Serbia was given political rights by the Hatt-i-Sharif of 1830.

Prince Mihailo Obrenović recognized him, because of a dispute over his brother Ljubomir. The last words of the Prince, which Kosta himself admitted when on trial were: Well, it's true. Mihailo and Anka were shot dead, and Katarina wounded. Further details of the plot behind the assassination have never been clarified; the sympathizers and cousins of the Karađorđević dynasty were suspected of being behind the crime, but this has not been proven."

For the next two years, Sava Grujić organized more major reforms in the army, improving her fighting capacity and giving her a new organization, Grujić realized that it was necessary to stiffen the back of the Serbian militia, so he split the standing army, which had seen little action during the first war, into smaller units that acted as cadres for the larger units of the militia. The troops were led by capable Serbian officers who proved their heroism and tactical ability. In 1876 King Milan had kept the standing army out of combat, fearing to commit the troops he saw primarily as protection for his dynasty, but Grujić reorganization turned it into the backbone of a considerably improved Serbian fighting force."
