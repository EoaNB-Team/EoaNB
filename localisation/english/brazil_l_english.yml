 BRA_imperial_army: "Exército Imperial Brasileiro"
 BRA_imperial_army_desc: "The Army of the Empire of Brazil is one of the most formidable land forces in the American continent. It was first organized in the War of Independence in September 1822, mainly by old Luso-Brazilian troops which stayed in the mainland and joined the cause of Dom Pedro I. It emerged victorious from the skirmishes against the Portuguese troops and by 1824 the war was over. Since then, the army went through many conflicts, including the Cisplatina War and, most recently, the Platine War. Following the end of the Platine War, the army's state started to decay, the number of troops decreased, and the lack of equipment and modernization became clear. If we expect to emerge victorious in future conflicts and secure our interests, the army needs to be modernized, rearmed and become the strongest in South America!"
 BRA_imperial_navy: "Armada Imperial Brasileira"
 BRA_imperial_navy_desc: "The Brazilian Armada is among the strongest fleets in the entire globe. Born in the struggle of Independence in 1822, the navy quickly assembled itself in order to protect the mainland from further Portuguese aggression. With the war concluded in 1825, the navy would be of key importance in securing the Empire's interests in the Platine Basin, being of key importance in the wars fought in the region. The navy needs to grow larger and stronger to maintain the status quo achieved in the Platine War, and to protect the lands of the Empire from outside aggression. However, the Empire currently does not sustain the capabilities to produce ships, forcing us to acquire new vessels from foreigners, such as the British and the French. If we want to make sure Brazil rules the waves, we must allocate new funds, and modernize and expand our fleet!"

Starting with the Portuguese, many ethnicities have found and will still find their way to our shores. This comes with its benefits; the immigrants bring with them knowledge and tradition, which can improve our country's culture. Economic growth is due to the increase in the size of the population and the settlement of the interior. Immigration, however, decreased after the approval of the 'Land Law', which forced new settlers to buy the lands from the government instead of settling them for free. If the Empire desires to become an industrial power, it needs to keep encouraging immigration to the country and facilitate and expand it in any way possible."

 dynmod_BRA_Agriculture_Money_desc: "The largest sector of the Brazilian economy is agriculture. One of the main reasons for Portuguese colonization is that the climatic variation found across the country allows for a multitude of potential economic activities. Be it coffee, tobacco, or sugarcane, there is an interest in its cultivation. However, this demonstrates that the economy of the Empire is, in its majority, still agrarian.\nMoney from Brazilian Agriculture: \n Livestock: [?BRA_Livestock_Country_Money] \n Coffee: [?BRA_Coffee_Country_Money]\n Sugar: [?BRA_Sugar_Country_Money] \n Tobacco: [?BRA_Tobacco_Country_Money] \n Cocoa: [?BRA_Livestock_Country_Money] \n Tea: [?BRA_Tea_Country_Money]"

 brazil.0.t: "President of the Council of Ministers"
 brazil.0.d: "Pedro de Araújo Lima, the Marquis of Olinda, was appointed as President of the Council of Ministers in May 1857 by Emperor Dom Pedro II, being scrutinized by the General Assembly of the Empire of Brazil shortly thereafter. In 1837, Pedro de Araújo Lima was one of the founders of the first national political association, the Party of Order. The Party of Order, being formed from the union of the latter with dissidents of the Moderate Liberal Party, also called Ximangos, and had as its political objective the fight against liberal measures taken during the Regency of Diogo Antônio Feijó. Later the Party of Order adopted the name of the Conservative Party. In September 1837, with the resignation of the acting Regent Diogo Antônio Feijó, Pedro de Araújo Lima was elected Regent of the Empire of Brazil, after a fierce dispute with the liberal candidate, Antônio de Holanda Cavalcanti, and governed the country in the name of Dom Pedro II, who was 12 years old. During his regency, he implemented the policies of the regressive movement by editing in 1840 the Law of Interpretation of the Additional Act, which reversed the liberal measures adopted since 1834. \nIn retaliation against the Conservative Party, on July 23 1840, the Liberal Party, created from the union of the Exalted Liberal Party and the Moderate Liberal Party, engineered the Majority Coup, where Pedro II took the throne at the age of 15 and Pedro de Araújo Lima, was removed from the Regency. Despite this, during the coronation of Pedro II in 1841, Pedro de Araújo Lima received the noble title of Viscount of Olinda. And in 1842 he was appointed Minister of the Council of State.\nIn 1848, with the victory of the Conservatives in the provincial elections, the Viscount of Olinda was appointed President of the Council of Ministers, a position created in July 1847 to head the State Council of Ministers. During this period Olinda appointed the deputy from Pará Herculano Pena as president of the province of Pernambuco. The response to this appointment was the beginning of an uprising in the province of Pernambuco, called the Praieira Revolution.\nIn 1854, Pedro de Araújo Lima was elevated from Viscount to Marquis. With the experience of the Marquis of Olinda, the Empire of Brazil will achieve prosperity."

 brazil.1.t: "Appointing Advisors"
 brazil.1.d: "The President of the Council of Ministers, Pedro de Araujo Lima, the Marquis of Olinda, wants the appointment of advisors to compose his ministry. \nHe chooses to continue the so-called political reconciliation by appointing a mixed cabinet comprised of conservative and liberal ministers"

 brazil.2.t: "Replace Minister of War"
 brazil.2.d: "Due to differences of opinion between the President of the Council of Ministers Pedro de Araújo Lima and the current Minister of War Jerônimo Coelho, the Minister of War was dismissed. José Antônio Saraiva will be appointed on an interim basis as Minister of War."

 brazil.3.t: "An Illitery Empire"
 brazil.3.d: "Although the 1824 Constitution stipulates that primary education should be free and accessible to all citizens, in practice public schools are mostly attended by children from wealthier families. And this negatively reflects on the technological advancement of the Brazilian Empire."
 brazil.3.a: "We need to change this."
 brazil.4.t: "General History of Brazil"
 brazil.4.d: "Commissioned by the Brazilian Historical and Geographical Institute, the second volume of the book General History of Brazil by author Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen was published. \nVarnhagen's book seeks to confirm a vision justifying the subjugation of the natives, and the superiority of Europeans over other peoples, based on racial, social and geographical determinisms. \nIt also criticizes the adoption of African slavery based on philanthropic feelings towards the natives and advocates its abolition."
 brazil.4.a: "OK"
 brazil.14.t: "The Empire of Brazil Announces their South American ambitions!"
 brazil.14.d: "After many discussions on their parliament, the government of the Empire of Brazil elected a war-lead and traditionalist government. This new government wishes to expand and reconquer their former lands. The european powers are scared to act because of the Monroe Doctrine, but even some British diplomats have announced taking protective measures."
 brazil.14.a: "Glory to Brazil!"
 brazil.14.b: "What are they trying to do?!"
 brazil.15.t: "Brazil Lays Claims to our Lands!"
 brazil.15.d: "The Empire of Brazil, after mobilizing, has claimed our lands and they wish to retake our country. We declared independence in the Cisplatina war, and we are not backing down!"
 brazil.15.a: "Viva Uruguay!"
 brazil.16.t: "Brazil Lays Claims to our Lands!"
 brazil.16.d: "The Empire of Brazil has mobilized and claimed our lands, justifying that we are on their natural borders, and that we are a small and weak nation that needs to be eliminated."
 brazil.16.a: "What?!"
 brazil.17.t: "Brazil Lays Claims to our Lands!"
 brazil.17.d: "The Empire of Brazil has claimed the Entre Rios region, justifying that we are on their natural borders, and that we are their natural enemies and that we need to be destroyed!"
 brazil.17.a: "Those Brazilians!"
 brazil.19.t: "Brazil Demands French Guyana!"
 brazil.19.d: "The Brazilians have instituted a new 'America for the Americans' policy, and they have sent an ultimatum demanding that we give them French Guyana."
 brazil.19.a: "Fine, Guyana isn't worth trouble."
 brazil.19.b: "The Brazilians do not recognize the power of the French Empire! We will not concede!"
 brazil.20.t: "France Refuses to Give us French Guyana!"
 brazil.20.d: "Their leader stands strong, and they challenge our empire! We cannot let them insult us! France does not recognize our threat."
 brazil.20.a: "Let us show the French their place!"

 brazil.24.t: "Brazil Condemns and Challenges our Government!"
 brazil.24.d: "The Brazilian government, that sympathizes with the Colorado party, is trying to intervene in our politics since 1851. Their government, lords and military are now trying to weaken and turn us into their puppets, only making profit for them, as they are interested in the rivers of La Plata. These idiots think that using the useless Colorados will lead to something!"
 brazil.24.a.: "Annoying imperialists!"
 brazil.25.t: "The Uruguayan War Begins!"
 brazil.25.d: "After the Argentinians tried to Liberate the Colorados, as they were against the Blanco government, in the crusade of 1863, The Blancos in Uruguay are getting more and more pressured by their neighbors. Brazil sent a diplomat that failed to accomplish anything, since he made demands that could not be accepted by the Blancos. The current Brazilian government supports the Colorados, and they are interested in isolating Uruguay from Paraguay and in getting access to the Platine region. Argentina also wants an ally against Paraguay, so they also supported the Colorados. Having rejected the demands, The Colorados and the Empire of Brazil declared war against the Uruguayan Blanco government."
 brazil.25.d_b: "After the Argentines tried to Liberate the Colorados, as they were against the Blanco government, in the crusade of 1863, The Blancos in Uruguay are getting more and more pressured by their neighbors. Brazil sent a diplomat that failed to accomplish anything, since he made demands that could not be accepted by the Blancos. The current Brazilian government supports the Brazilian ranchers in Uruguay, and they are interesteed in isolationg Uruguay from Paraguay and in getting access to the Platine region. Argentina, fearing a possible Brazilian domination of the region, and wanting an ally againts Paraguay, further strengthened its support for the Colorados.\nAfter their demands were rejected, the Colorados with, Argentine support, announced a declaration of war to the Uruguayan Blanco government. And simultaneously, in a surprising escalation of events, Brazilian ranchers in Uruguay started an organized armed revolt with the intention of installing a government aligned with their own interests. Called Cisplatinos, the Brazilian rebels seek mainly the reversal of policies that repressed their businesses and the return of free trade on the Brazil-Uruguay border. Some members of the revolt leadership are even considering the annexation of Uruguay into Brazil. The government of Brazil quickly announced its full support for the Cisplatinos, providing arms and volunteers. \nThe Uruguayan Civil War has begun."
 brazil.25.a: "For Brazil! Send in the army!"
 brazil.25.a2: "For the Cisplatinos! Send in the army!"
 brazil.25.b: "Oh no..! A Civil war?!"
 brazil.25.b2: "Oh no..! A three-side Civil War!?!"
 brazil.25.c: "An expected development."
 brazil.25.d1: "Send our support."
 brazil.25.d2: "For the Platines! Send in the army!"
 
 brazil.27.t: "The Secretary of Agriculture, Commerce and Public Works is Established."
 brazil.27.d: "A new decree has created a new secretary that will take care of supporting the national industry, dealing with mines, agriculture and most of our navigations through rivers. Our industry may be modernized but that is said to be too costly, so we have to decide if our new secretary will focus on agriculture or industry."
 brazil.27.a: "Focus on agriculture!"
 brazil.27.b: "Focus on industry!"
 brazil.28.t: "Pedro II Announces the Economic Box of the Court"
 brazil.28.d: "The purpose of the box is to encourage savings and grant loans under pledge, with the guarantee of the Imperial government. This characteristic differentiates the institution from others, who act in the market without giving security to the depositors or who charged excessive interest of the debtors. In this way, the company is quickly being sought by the most popular social strata, including slaves, who can save for their manumission letters. Thus, the company's president has already announced his focus on social problems."
 brazil.28.a: "Interesting and useful."
 brazil.29.t: "The Archaeological, Historical and Geographical Institute of Pernambuco is Established"
 brazil.29.d: "The institution was founded by a group of progressive intellectuals from the Recife Law University and is the only regional institute in Brazil. The first president and founder was Francisco Muniz Tavares. It was inspired by critiques made by Emperor Pedro II when he visited Recife in 1859 about the neglect and indifference of the Pernambucan intellectuals regarding the historical past of the province."
 brazil.29.a: "We should value our history."
 brazil.30.t: "The Metric System is Implemented"
 brazil.30.d: "Finally, inspired by the proposal of Batista de Oliveira and demonstrations of other defenders, the implementation of the metric system became law. The Metric System gradually replaces the current system of weights and measures throughout the Empire, so that in ten years we shall cease entirely the legal use of old weights and measures. The new act was met with resistance, though, some say that they will continue using the old measures for centuries to come."
 brazil.30.a: "A controversial innovation."
 brazil.31.t: "The Christie Crisis"
 brazil.31.d: "In June 1861, the British merchant ship Prince of Wales had ran aground on the beach of the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. The crew left the ship and went to look for help from local authorities and while they were gone, their ship was pillaged by looters. The crew returned and they were murdered by the same looters, who escaped to Uruguay and other provinces. Foreign minister Earl Russell found out about the case and realized that it only happened due to the incompetence of the Brazilian authorities. He could not find all the results and decided to talk with William Dougal Christie, who decided to send two ships to investigate himself and talk with the local provincial president. An agreement could not be found and the loot and murders are still unsolved."
 brazil.31.a: "A sad incident to our stability."
 brazil.31.b: "Demand an apology and reparations, now!"
 brazil.32.t: "Britain Demands an Apology and Reparations!"
 brazil.32.d: "British ambassador William Dougal Christie has decided that the disaster that happened in our southern beaches is the fault of our incompetence. The ambassador has requested that our Emperor give him a formal apology and reparations! That is obviously unacceptable since it was but a little incident."
 brazil.32.a: "Tell them to wait for our judge's actions."
 brazil.33.t: "Brazil responds to our demands!"
 brazil.33.d: "The Brazilian Emperor has told our ambassador William Dougal Christie that he should wait for their ministry of justice to analyze the evidences and solve the case. The reparations will not be given and tensions have rose due to that."
 brazil.33.a: "Let us wait for those fools, this can be solved peacefully."
 brazil.34.t: "The HMS Forte Incident"
 brazil.34.d: "On June 17, George Geoffrey Ward Clemenger, the admiral of the HMS Forte, was with his crew visiting a bar to drink. He was stopped by a marine, who was already enraged at the British drunk The British Marine in the area heard about the imprisonment and decided to intervene, judging the fact that the police were not imprisoning. The Brazilian marines were unrighteous and disrespectful. Warren wrote a letter to the ambassador Christie, who previously had problems with Brazil and the ambassador arrived on the 1st of July, noticing that nothing had been done. consulate that the officials were treated like regular criminals and had no chance to be judged."
 brazil.34.a: "Another crisis with Britain? They are becoming a problem.."
 brazil.34.b: "What an inequitable action! Demand that our men be judged by the British court."
 brazil.35.t: "Britain demands their men be judged by their own court."
 brazil.35.d: "After the imprisonment of the British marines, William Dougal Christie has demanded that their men be judged in England and not in the 'unfair' courts of Brazil. Antônio Coelho de Sá and Albuquerque sent a diplomatic note to the British ambassador requesting that those responsible for the incident be made available to the national authorities. The procedure is necessary because the British subjects only respond to the courts of their country."
 brazil.35.a: "This will be solved in Brazilian soil!"
 brazil.36.t: "Brazil rejects our demands!"
 brazil.36.d: "The Brazilian Ambassador Antônio Coelho de Sá and Albuquerque requested that our government does not intervene in the judgement of the unfairly imprisoned marines. This is outrageous and William Dougal Christie has announced that he plans to threaten the Brazilian government to act about this case and the past case from the Prince of Wales. Our nation is mostly certain that we should send a powerful threat to those savages!"
 brazil.36.a: "Send then an ultimatum."
 brazil.36.b: "They're right, we should back away."
 brazil.37.t: "The United Kingdom sends an ultimatum!"
 brazil.37.d: "William Dougal Christie has told our Emperor that if the reparations from The Prince of Wales loot was not paid, if the Brazilian marines were involved in the bar fight were not imprisoned, if the policeman that imprisoned the marines were not demoted and if Brazil did not send a formal apology to the United Kingdom: the royal navy would blockade Rio de Janeiro and the Guanabara Bay. This is a threat to our nation that is an immense stab at our nationalistic pride! The British seem to have no respect for Brazil."
 brazil.37.a: "Tell them that the Empire of Brazil is ready for war."
 brazil.38.t: "Britain backs down"
 brazil.38.d: "Noticing that we were on the right side, the british have backed down and decided that we should judge the marines. This puts an end to the instability in our nation as the crisis is finally over."
 brazil.38.a: "Amazing!"
 brazil.39.t: "The Empire of Brazil rejects our ultimatum!"
 brazil.39.d: "The Empire of Brazil has rejected our ultimatum that was sent by William Dougal Christie. Their emperor has taken our words that we would block the port of the city of Rio de Janeiro personally to his nation and he has decided to utter words that truly impressed the entire british embassy! After hearing our ultimatum, the emperor of Brazil proudly said that \n\n'The Empire of Brazil is ready for war.' /nIt seems that this was a foolish action, as our royal navy is immediately ready to threaten them! We shall get justice for our marines and reparations for the Prince of Wales! Britain will not back down!"
 brazil.39.a: "Blockade the Bay! Those Brazilians will see! Demand our reparations now!"
 brazil.40.t: "The British Navy blockades our bay!"
 brazil.40.d: "After we rejected the British ultimatum, the royal navy has sent a war squadron under Rear Admiral Richard Laird Warren, consisting of the frigate HMS Forte, the schooners HMS Stromboli and HMS Curlew, the corvette HMS Satellite and the gunboat HMS Doterel, who has captured 5 ships that were anchored and demanded a compensation of 3200 pounds. This infuriated our capital, as this is an act of disrespect and is violating our national waters and territories. It is our emperor choice if he will rally the people against this act or if he will desist. The fate of Brazil is uncertain!"
 brazil.40.a: "Rally the people! We will shatter relations with the British and demand the return of our ships!."
 brazil.40.b: "It is time to pay them.."
 brazil.41.t: "Brazil refuses to pay and ceases diplomatic relations!"
 brazil.41.d: "The Empire of Brazil has rallied their citizens and decided that they shall not bow to us. This foolish act was met with our blockade leaving to recover in Saint Helena and them deciding to demand that we return our ships and give a formal apology. We may not be able to afford a war with the Brazilian navy but if it is necessary to teach them a lesson, we shall shatter their ignorance towards our power! It is our decision to choose if we end this in a diplomatic standoff or an all-out conflict."
 brazil.41.a: "Let us solve this diplomatically. They'll pay us anyways."
 brazil.41.b: "This means war! This insubordination will be met with cannons!"
 brazil.42.t: "The British retreat to Saint Helena for peace"
 brazil.42.d: "The British navy, with our captured ships, has retreated to Saint Helena. It seems that they want peace instead of an all-out war, our diplomats in London are gathering to demand them to pay us our reparations. The situation is divisive and may need foreign support."
 brazil.42.a: "Ask for the international consulate of justice to judge this case."
 brazil.43.t: "Brazil demands that the international consulate judges our crisis"
 brazil.43.d: "The Brazilian diplomats still in London have demanded that the international justice deals with the Christie Question. We were running short on options and it seems that diplomacy was impossible, but King Leopold I of Belgium, uncle of our Queen Victoria and our ally, has offered himself to judge our case."
 brazil.43.a: "Leopold shall judge the case!"
 brazil.44.t: "Judging The Christie Question"
 brazil.44.d: "Our King, Leopold I, has offered his support to judge the Christie Question, the crisis between Brazil and Britain. We have to remember that Britain is our ally since the beggining, our family is related to theirs and they supported us industrialize. In the other hand, this crisis seems like Britain is violating Brazil's sovereignity and our ambassadors have made great progress in trying to ally Brazil, losing their support would be a waste of diplomacy."
 brazil.44.a: "Side with Brazil."
 brazil.44.b: "Side with Britain."
 brazil.45.t: "Leopold sides with Brazil"
 brazil.45.d: "King Leopold of Belgium has decided that Brazil is on the right side of this crisis, stating that Britain should pay reparations and apologize with Brazil giving an apology as well for the accident at HMS Forte. The terms are in Brazil's side, to everyone's surprise."
 brazil.45.a: "Traitor...let us send a treaty proposal to Brazil."
 brazil.45.b: "Thank you, Leopold!"
 brazil.46.t: "Leopold sides with Britain"
 brazil.46.d: "King Leopold of Belgium, as expected by the British royals, has sided with his family and decided that Britain is on the right side. He states that Brazil should pay reparations and Britain should not be punished for their reaction."
 brazil.46.a: "Indeed, let us demand our reparations."
 brazil.46.b: "A terrible outcome."
 brazil.47.t: "Britain offers to compromise."
 brazil.47.d: "The British Empire has offered to compromise once again with better terms but they still want us to pay reparations for the incidents that were not our fault. They may be more diplomatic now, but it is still an unfair treaty."
 brazil.47.a: "Reject it."
 brazil.48.t: "Britain offers to compromise."
 brazil.48.d: "The British Empire has offered to compromise once again with terrible terms. They still want us to pay reparations for the incidents that were not our fault. They have gained Belgium support and this is still an unfair treaty even after the international court's judgement."
 brazil.48.a: "Reject it."
 brazil.49.t: "Solving the Crisis with Brazil"
 brazil.49.d: "Our relations with Brazil have been damaged for long enough. We have to solve this by sending Sir Edward Thornton for our best offers to Brazil. They will be pressured by the fact that this crisis has dealt instability to them and we will reconcile with a possible ally once again. British envoys with ambassadors are being sent to the shores of Argentina and Brazil, planning to talk with the diplomats of the other empire."
 brazil.49.a: "May this be solved at last!"
 brazil.50.t: "Solving the Crisis with Brazil"
 brazil.50.d: "Our relations with Brazil have been damaged for long enough. We have to solve this by sending Sir Edward Thornton for our last ultimatum to Brazil. They will be pressured by the fact that this crisis has dealt instability to them and we will reconcile with a possible ally once again. British envoys with ambassadors are being sent to the shores of Argentina and Brazil, planning to talk with the diplomats of the other empire."
 brazil.50.a: "May this be solved at last!"
 brazil.51.t: "Solving the Crisis with Britain"
 brazil.51.d: "Our Marquis of Olinda, Pedro Araújo Lima has had talks with Sir Edward Thornton and they have come to favorable terms as Brazil will pay reparations to Britain and diplomatic relations will be reestablished. It seems that after all our discussion, this will end in Brazil paying its reparations but with a formal apology from Britain and our alliance intact once again."
 brazil.51.a: "Finally, peace."
 brazil.52.t: "Solving the Crisis with Britain"
 brazil.52.d: "Our Marquis of Olinda, Pedro Araújo Lima has had talks with Sir Edward Thornton and they have come to necessary terms as Brazil will pay reparations to Britain. It seems that after all our discussion, this will end in Brazil paying its reparations due to the decision from the international court."
 brazil.52.a: "Sad..but necessary."
 brazil.53.t: "Reconciliation with Brazil"
 brazil.53.d: "The Empire of Brazil has paid us our reparations, but due to the results of the international court's judgement by Leopold, we have to send them a formal apology. Our Queen Victoria, that respects Pedro II, has decided to send a formal apology to the Emperor of the nation, expecting it to arrive to him and Thornton, truly ending this crisis."
 brazil.53.a: "Allies once again."
 brazil.54.t: "End of the Christie Question"
 brazil.54.d: "The Queen of Britain has sent her formal apology to our Emperor and Thornton, the ambassador has received and read it to him during an audience in Uruguaiana. She states that this misunderstanding may never happen again and that Brazil and Britain shall be allies forever, securing our interests over Latin America and our trade relations."
 brazil.54.a: "How satisfying."
 brazil.55.t: "The General Plan"
 brazil.55.d: "Our generals have devised a plan to beat the British. We need to capture The island of Ascension, The Island of Saint Helena and Guyana, making their invasion capabilities break down and we will achieve victory that way."
 brazil.55.a: "Amazing plan!"
 brazil.59.t: "Solving our Border with Bolivia"
 brazil.59.d: "Our border conflicts with Bolivia over the rivers of Guaporé and Mamoré have been very damaging. We both dispute land on each side of the border and due to the tensions, navigation on their rivers and trade with Bolivia are impossible to maintain. Our best diplomats have reunited and decided that a treaty with them over our border shall be established, but some disagree, stating that we shall keep our claims to the inner regions of Amazonas."
 brazil.59.a: "Send them a proposal!"
 brazil.59.b: "Strenghthen our claims."
 brazil.60.t: "The Slavery Promises"
 brazil.60.d: "Our slaves that fought in the Paraguayan War have been promised freedom after their return, but it was truly never given to most of them. The lawyer Teixeira Júnior has proposed a law for our congress that will release those veteran slaves and give them some freedoms. This action is heavily debated, though, as most of our congress does not want to lose some of their most hard-working slaves. The vote shall begin today."
 brazil.60.a: "Keep the veterans as slaves."
 brazil.60.b: "Release the veterans."
 brazil.61.t: "The Republican Manifesto"
 brazil.61.d: "A statement published by the dissident members of the Liberal Party, led by Quintino Bocaiúva and Joaquim Saldanha Marinho has arrived in Rio de Janeiro made by the Republican club. It was signed by over 60 people, including engineers, doctors, lawyers, businessman and some journalists that spread it on the news. It has arrived with the ideology to overthrowing of the Monarchy and the establishment of a federative republic in our country. Their ideals seem divided between revolutionaries and peaceful reformists. The emperor has not fully censored the manifesto, seeing it as a betrayal but one that cannot harm Brazil."
 brazil.61.a: "An interesting manifesto."
 brazil.62.t: "The Guarani: Brazilian Novel"
 brazil.62.d: "On January 1, 1857, the opening chapter of the novel called The Guarani: the Brazilian novel was published in the Diary of Rio de Janeiro, in the form of a feuilleton. \nThe historical novel, written by José Martiniano de Alencar, takes place over two hundred years ago, during the Brazilian colonial period, when Brazil was under Portuguese rule. \nThe novel tells a story of love and adventure. \nIn a setting that is a true tropical paradise, close to lush forests, lives Cecília de Mariz, the beautiful protagonist of the novel. The girl has white skin, is blonde and has blue eyes. She is the daughter of a Portuguese nobleman, and lives an aristocratic, almost princely life, and is very protected by her family. \nThe protagonist of the novel is Peri, a tall, strong and kind-hearted Guarani Indian. He has a real adoration for the girl, and the two are very good friends. But a series of events puts Cecília and Peri's lives in danger. \nJosé de Alencar, the novel's writer, extols: Brazilian nationalism through the idealization of indigenous traditions, portraying the Indian as a mythical national hero, influenced mainly by medieval romanticism; the appreciation of nature, extolling the exuberance of Brazilian biomes; and the distance from the Portuguese, the former colonizers of the Brazilian people.\nSince independence, the Empire of Brazil has faced separatist revolts of the most diverse natures, mainly due to the strong sense of regionalism of the population.\nAnd the incorporation of indigenous traditions and values ​​to Brazilian national values, can help to solidify the sense of belonging to the Empire of Brazil, replacing regional values, thus strengthening Brazilian nationalism."
 brazil.62.a: "Praise for our national values!"
 brazil.65.t: "Debate Over Economic Policy"
 brazil.65.d: "There are two tactics of dealing with national finances and dealing with the crisis. \nThe metalistic tactic increases stability through the adoption of the gold standard and the monopoly of issuance by the National Bank. \nWith an opposite guideline, the paper tactic proposes issuing plurality, allowing any bank to issue bonds equivalent to paper money. The market is self-regulating and guarantees monetary liquidity.\nThe current Minister of Finance is a staunch defender of banking plurality, and therefore a supporter of paper tactics."
 brazil.65.a: "Adopt paper tatics"
 brazil.65.b: "Adopt metal tatics"
 brazil.66.t: "The Ibicaba Revolt"
 brazil.66.d: "The Ibicaba Revolt was a rebellion of foreign workers at the Ibicaba farm in Limeira, within the province of São Paulo. They rebelled against the exploitation of their labour by Brazilian masters who used the partnership system. In the partnership system, rules were set for the organization of work and labour, and for the division of earnings from coffee production. However, the partnership system began to face problems. One of its most frequent problems was the immigrant's revolts over mistreatment and their endless indebtedness to the coffee farmers. Immigrant workers demand better treatment conditions and fair pay for their work.\nThis revolt showed that it is necessary to replace the so-called partnership system by paying for work through salary instead.\nOur attempt to hide the Ibicaba Revolt was unsuccessful. \nThe scandal leaked and the European press reported the revolt and the treatment that the immigrants received from the Brazilian lords. The European countries repudiated the treatment analogous to slavery that their people received and demand from the Empire of Brazil a better treatment of its citizens."
 brazil.66.a: "This is a disaster!"
 brazil.69.t: "The First Legislature After Reform!"
 brazil.69.d: "During the office of the Marquis of Paraná, in 1855, the last electoral reform took place. Proposed by Carneiro Leão, Marquis of Paraná, to avoid a conservative majority in the chamber, the famous 'Circles Law' aimed to revert the exclusion caused by the electoral reform of 1846 and generate a renewal in the parliament's staff. \nThe vast majority of the members of the conservative political group are landowners or public servants. The idea is that politicians must step away from public office for at least 6 months before being able to run for office, in order to reduce his influence on the electorate. \nIn addition to limiting the activities of public servants, the 1855 'Law of Circles' determines the division into circles, or electoral districts, in which each circle elects a deputy. Consequently, with the new rules and the decentralization of voting, there is a major renewal in parliament, which now is composed by a third by liberals."
 brazil.69.a: "Hooray for the legislature!"
 brazil.70.t: "History of the Empire of Brazil"
 brazil.70.d: "The country we know today as the Empire of Brazil was born in 1822, after years of being a united kingdom with Portugal. The attempt to reduce Brazil's autonomy backfired and resulted in the famous cry of Regent-Prince Pedro on September 7: “Independence or death!” In the years that followed, Brazil became independent and Pedro was crowned Emperor Dom Pedro I. Over the next decade, Brazil faced corruption, scandals, revolts and instability, all of which led to Dom Pedro I's abdication and his return to Portugal in 1831, leaving his 5-year-old son Pedro alone in Brazil. Over the next few years, the empire was barely able to remain intact, separatist revolts in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina as well as social and slave uprisings in the southeast, north and northeast of the country called the authority of the Regencial Council into question. Finally, in 1840, the parliament was forced by a coup d'état to accept the coronation of the 15-year-old Prince Pedro. Dom Pedro II then set out to stabilize and unite Brazil."
 brazil.70.a: "“Ave Glória...”"
 brazil.71.t: "The Reign of Dom Pedro II"
 brazil.71.d: "The coronation of Dom Pedro II resonated throughout the empire, and the image of the emperor led to a decrease in revolts and an increase in political stability. In 1847, the office of Prime-Minister was introduced, making the country an almost entirely parliamentary monarchy, considering that the monarch still appointed the Prime-Minister and senators based on a list of candidates sent by Parliament. Finally, in 1850, under the influence of British pressure, the controversial Eusébio de Queirós Act finally banned the transatlantic slave trade, beginning the long journey towards the abolition of slavery.\n\nThe secessionist uprisings in the south of the country were put down by the imperial army, and in March 1845, the Rio-Grandense Republic was dissolved, ending the secessionist chaos in the region.\nThe empire is now united and the eyes of the world are turned to Brazil, as the nation enjoys of economic growth and enters its Golden Age. Will the foundations laid by Dom Pedro II flourish into a strong, industrially modernized country? Or will it be destroyed by the advocates of slavery and the positivist cells that threaten our monarchy?"

 brazil.323.d: "The Rio de la Plata basin is an important means of navigation and communication. It extends to Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Economically, it is the most important river in South America, as access to many territories in these countries is possible thanks to navigation in the La Plata Basin and its tributaries. And it is through this that products are imported or exported in the region. Therefore, the control of the Rio de la Plata basin is vital for the interests of all the countries that bathe in it. Whoever dominates the River Plate, dominates the trade, navigation and transport of the entire region. Sometimes these interests overlap, leading to hostilities between countries in the region, which can even escalate into war."
 brazil.323.d1: "After the recognition and legitimation of the claims of Brazilian Lords and the application of pressure to the Uruguay Government, the situation at the border between the two noises became tense. Often strongly armed Brazilians escorted cattle in search of pasture, crossing the Uruguayan border. In one of these escorts, Uruguayan officers who patrolled the border in the province artigas, saw the Brazilians armed, fearing the beginning of an invasion, the Uruguayans approached the Brazilian escort. It is not known who gave the first shot but this battle can begin a new armed conflict in the Rio de la Plata Basin."

In light of this, the Brazilian Minister Plenipotentiary informed the Blanco leaders that in rejecting the ultimatum, the Brazilian military received orders to initiate retaliation against Uruguay. The Brazilian intervention had the local support of the Colorado Rebels who saw the opportunity to finally take power in Montevideo. The sending of Brazilian troops against Uruguay, now commanded directly by officers of the imperial army, starts the Uruguay War."

 brazil.903.a: "Thank God!"
 brazil.904.t: "Negotiations with the Carriers Fail!"
 brazil.904.d: "Negotiations have failed, we are forced to concede to their demands, and repeal the law. This has resulted in a small decrease to the legitimacy of Bahia's government, but the worst is over."

And it is through this that products are imported or exported in the region. Therefore, the control of the Rio de la Plata basin is vital for the interests of all the countries that bathe in it. Whoever dominates the River Plate, dominates the trade, navigation and transport of the entire region. Sometimes these interests overlap, leading to hostilities between countries in the region, which can even escalate into war."

 bahia.1.d: "Our worse fears have turned into reality. The carrier strikers of Salvador have proclaimed their intention to take matters into their own hands. With our military garrison defeated and expelled from the city, we were unable to stop them from capturing Salvador. Luiza Mahin, a legendary and mythical figure from the Malês Revolt, has escaped from Rio de Janeiro and has arrived at Salvador to lead the Bahian slaves once again. After years of stability, internal conflict has returned to the Empire..."

We have been forced to accept their demands and end the conflict. A shame to our army and our legitimacy, we can only hope the triumph of the Second Malês Revolt is quickly forgotten by our people, and that it falls in disgrace before it can encourage more rebellions and harm our stability even further."
 bahia.5.t: "The Malês Offer Peace"
 bahia.5.a: "Peace, but at what cost?"
 bahia.5.d: "Both our army and the Malês rebels have failed to make gains in the conflict, and as it stagnated and kept making damages to our economy and stability, we have accepted to negotiate with the Malês. We will remove the taxes placed upon the badges and grant amnesty to the rebels. In exchange, the Malês have accepted the usage of the identification badges and the reinstatement of the old Salvador government. A war that led to nowhere, fought over futile reasons. Which in the end achieved nothing, but destruction and harm to both us and the people of Salvador."
