We could propose a compromise that would leave our commune autonomous, but no doubt capitulations would need to be made. Alternatively the [MIN.GetName] is in direct competition with the [ASA.GetName]. By proposing a guarantee with them, it would give the [ASA.GetName] a two front war upon one of us being attacked. The [MIN.GetName] has not proclaimed any aggressive expansion policies, which may yield neutrality amongst them if nothing is done.\n\nChoosing either side will mark us an enemy to the other, but doing nothing equally puts us at risk of annexation by the [ASA.GetName].

This could greatly stimulate our industrial sectors with new technology and provide cheap consumer goods to the people. Though it's outlined in the treaty to allow for work visas to fill the growing demand for workers in the [MHC.GetName]'s industrial centers. This could potentially lead to our workers being sympathetic to anarchist ideas on labor, and potential general strikes in our own industrial centers.

It's quite important to choose wisely which faction will herald the revolution.\n\nEach faction is roughly tied for popularity except for Marxism. A Marxism victory would be controversial if the party's policies conflict with the revolution's Anarchist origins.
