### Event titles, descriptions and options
 britain.1.t: "\"The Great Stink\""
 britain.1.d: "The Thames has become increasingly more polluted by sewer connections and industrial outlets during the last few years, and now the situation has, quite literally, overboiled. The hot temperatures this month have made water in the river evaporate, so that huge piles of industrial and human waste products remained on its banks, combining with the hot air to generate a stink that is so unbearable, boat travel on the river has almost completely stopped and no one dares step near it anymore to preserve their own well being. We must do something about this!"
 britain.1.a: "Disgusting!"
 britain.2.t: "The Sea Cable to America"
 britain.2.d: "Last night British and American diplomats celebrated as a sea cable from Cardiff to Boston that had been lain for the past few months was finally completed. While not being the first of such undersea cables, and while not fully functional yet, it is still revolutionary in allowing for rapid communication between us and the Americans, and we can only expect an expansion of this network in the future."
 britain.2.a: "A wondrous thing, the march of technology."
 britain.3.t: "The Irish Republican Brotherhood"
 britain.3.d: "It's not out of the ordinary for St. Patrick's day to result in the occasional drunken Irishman attacking British Police while yelling about Independence. What is new however, is that the Irish Seperatists have now founded an organization in Dublin, called the \"Irish Republican Brotherhood\". Their goal is to end British Rule in Ireland - what should be done about it?"
 britain.3.a: "We will watch their every move."
 britain.3.b: "Send in the military police and dismantle the organization!"
 britain.4.t: "\"The Critique of Political Economy\""
 britain.4.d: "Popular political author Karl Marx, residing in the city of London, has published yet another book, in which he attacks the current economy in our country and the idea of capitalism in general, while also discussing the political implications of the system. While it doesn't seem to sell very well as of now, it could still cause an unwanted stir - the question now is: Should we do anything to intervene?"
 britain.4.a: "This better not cause any trouble."
 britain.4.b: "Ban this book immediately!"
 britain.4.c: "Actually, he makes some good points..."
 britain.5.t: "Greece asks for help"

 britain.6.t: "The Obscene Publications Act"
 britain.6.d: "The second parliamentary issue to vote on is the Obscene Publications Act. If it is passed, it would prohibit the publication of material that could be considered obscene to the general public, including but not limited to imagery displaying nudity, sex, excessive drinking or swearing and otherwise offensive material. Liberals are up in arms over the act, while many conservatives support it. After a vote, the parliament has decided..."
 britain.6.a: "...that our society is better off without this smut."
 britain.6.b: "...that we cannot allow this repression of the arts and free speech."
 britain.7.t: "Prison Hulk catches fire in Woolwich!"

Prisoners and Crew tried to flee the ship as quickly as possible, but unfortunately not all of them made it. The remaining parts of the ship are already being scrapped in Shipyards, and Parliament is now voting on a proposition to stop the use of wooden prison hulks in home waters."
 britain.7.a: "How horrible!"
 britain.8.t: "The world's first Football Team"
 britain.8.d: "Football is a relatively new sport that has been conquering the hearts of our people for a few decades, and now the sport is going professional: The first official football team, the Sheffield FC, was founded yesterday in Sheffield. If the popularity of football continues to rise in this fashion, it may even become a popular international sport someday!"
 britain.8.a: "Good for them!"
 britain.8.b: "What nonsense! They should play a gentleman's sport instead..."
 britain.9.t: "\"Big Ben\" recast at Whitechapel Bell Foundry"
 britain.9.d: "The Great Bell of the clock tower for the palace of Westminster in London, called \"Big Ben\" has been recast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry after the need arose. The new bell is already being installed, and will hopefully be fully operational tomorrow."

 britain.11.t: "The Hyde Park Ceremony"

 britain.12.t: "Lionel de Rothschild enters Parliament"
 britain.12.d: "The [ENG.GetAdjective] parliament got its first Jewish delegate today, as Lionel de Rothschild has entered diplomatic service as a member. Liberals and Egalitarians are happy to see we are doing our best to abolish societal discrimination in [ENG.GetNameDef] - although the whole ordeal has been met with criticism from anti-semites, and from the more radical religious factions..."
 britain.12.a: "Good luck to him then."
 britain.12.b: "A Jew in parliament?! Evict him!"
 britain.12.c: "A non-christian in parliament?! Evict him!"
 britain.13.t: "Spain sells Equatorial Guinea"
 britain.13.d: "Spain has offered us its African colony of Equatorial Guinea in exchange for a payment. We can afford it without problem although the land in question is hardly worth anything."
 britain.13.a: "Okay, buy it"
 britain.13.b: "We have no interest in the Spanish colonies."
 britain.14.t: "Poisoning Tragedy in Bradford"
 britain.14.d: "A horrible accident occurred in Bradford, a small town near Leeds yesterday when it was discovered that 21 had died and at least 200 were poisoned in an event where on a sale of sweets, arsenic had been used accidentally during the production process. Local physicians are working around the clock to aid the affected, and the whole city is shook."

 britain.15.t: "National Portrait Gallery opens in London"
 britain.15.d: "After years of construction and preparations, the national portrait gallery has finally opened in London! This already culturally significant institution displays portraits from artists all about [ENG.GetNameDef], and art critics are seemingly impressed."

 britain.16.t: "\"All the Year Round\""
 britain.16.d: "Charles Dickens, most famous author of [ENG.GetNameDef], has just started publishing his new magazine, \"All the Year Round\".

 britain.16.a: "A busy man, this Mr. Dickens."
 britain.17.t: "Astronomer observes \"Solar Flare\""
 britain.17.d: "Richard Christopher Carrington, a renowned astronomer from West London claims to have observed something completely new last night, something he calls a \"solar flare\". These sudden flashes of brightness on the sun, as he describes them, have never been observed before and the physicists are up and excited about the implications this has for earth - Carrington himself has even already suggested the magnetic field of our planet might be affected by this. Our universe is truly amazing..."
 britain.17.a: "A curious phenomenon!"
 britain.18.t: "Massive Storm hits the British Isles!"
 britain.18.d: "The biggest storm to hit Britain this century so far has devastated coastal regions last night as gigantic waves and devastating winds blew for several hours throughout the evening. Up to 130 naval vessels, mostly trade hulls have been reported to been sunk or ran ashore, and up to 800 people are reported missing or dead. Some of our more radical priests are calling this God's punishment for our sins already - true or not, the disaster has shaken the country. Time to start rebuilding."
 britain.18.a: "What a tragedy!"
 britain.19.t: "Walker found on Honduras!"
 britain.19.d: "Famous Filibuster and American Mercenary William Walker, the former president of Nicaragua and the one that caused a lot of trouble to our Central American allies and to some of our army in Miskito. Walker and what was left of his army were allowed to reorganize in the Miskito Coast by some sympathizers. The Filibuster then invaded Honduras with a force of 91 man and began to march to Nicaragua, but he was stopped by Honduran troops. He is bringing in reinforcements, what should we do?"
 britain.19.a: "Block the coast and bring him to justice. Get rid of William Walker!"
 britain.19.b: "Let him go. Nothing will happen anyways."
 britain.20.t: "Return of Walker"
 britain.20.d: "William Walker, American filibuster who has tried to conquer Baja California, Sonora and most of Central America has returned and he reunited a militia that took control of Tegucigalpa in days and he installed himself as the new president of Honduras. This has been met with enormous backlash from both Nicaragua and El Salvador, that requested for him to resign or war would happen. Walker refused to resign and it seems that Walker's misadventures are leading to another war."
 britain.20.a: "Walker is still alive? What?!"
 britain.20.b: "This time we'll make sure he's dead!"
 britain.20.c: "Not again!"
 britain.21.t: "British Tourists In Switzerland"
 britain.21.d: "In 1863, a British travel agency carried out the first organised tour to Switzerland. This paved the way for tourism in Switzerland and at the same time provided an incentive for the construction of the railway network in Switzerland. British tourists still account for the third-largest group of foreign visitors to Switzerland today."
 britain.21.a: "Maybe, we'll colonize them too..."
 britain.22.t: "The Golden Age of Alpinism (1854-1865)"
 britain.22.d: "The Golden Age of Alpinism is the period between Alfred Will's (1828-1912) ascent of Wetterhorn in 1854 and Edward Whymper's (1840-1911) ascent of Matterhorn in 1865. Both climbers were English. Many major Alpine peaks met their first ascents during the period. Although Alfred Will's ascent was not the first one, people commemorate the latter ascent, which marked the start of the Golden Age of Alpinism. The Golden Age of Alpinism was dominated by British Alpine climbers accompanied by Swiss and French guides. The era ended with Whymper's ascent of the Matterhorn, which caused death of 4 people; 3 well-known British Alpinists and 1 French Alpine guide. There had been 64 successful assaults on Mont Blanc during the period 1852 to 1857, and only 4 of them were not British."
 britain.22.a: "Even the mountains bow to the British Empire!"
 britain.23.t: "The Silver Age of Alpinism (1865-1882)"
 britain.23.d: "The Silver Age of Alpinism began after the Edward Whymper's ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 and ended with William Woodman Graham (1859-1932) ascent of the Dent du Geant in 1882. While the Golden Age of Alpinism (1854-1865) was characterized by the first ascents of many of the Alps' most dominant mountains, the subsequent silver age may be seen as consisting of the first ascents of those few worthwhile peaks left unclimbed, although these peaks were - and remained - largely unknown to the wider public. Many mountaineers from different nations joined the group of leading ascendants of Alps. Although British mountaineers did not dominate the era, still a lot of famous mountaineers in the Silver Age of Alpinism were British, such as Clinton Thomas Dent (1850-1912). His first ascents in the Alps include the Lenzspitze of the Pennie Alps (1870). There is a record that Queen Victoria of the Great Britain had spent her holiday in 1868, in Lucerne, Switzerland. This later derived more British attention on Switzerland."
 britain.23.a: "Interesting"
 britain.24.t: "John Stuart Mill - On Liberty, 1858"
 britain.24.d: "\"On Liberty\" is a philosophical work by the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, originally intended as a short essay. The work, published in 1859, applies Mill's ethical system of utilitarianism to society and the state. Mill attempts to establish standards for the relationship between authority and liberty. He emphasizes the importance of individuality, which he conceived as a prerequisite to the higher pleasures—the summum bonum of utilitarianism. Furthermore, Mill criticizes the errors of past attempts to defend individuality where, for example, democratic ideals resulted in the "tyranny of the majority". Among the standards established in this work are Mill's three basic liberties of individuals, his three legitimate objections to government intervention, and his two maxims regarding the relationship of the individual to society."
 britain.24.a: "An interesting book..."
 britain.24.b: "What a bunch of rubbish!"
 britain.25.t: "The Panic Of 1862"
 britain.25.d: "In London fear of crime was a persistent, reoccurring issue thanks to a few instances of robbery and murder, and, of course, the news media. In particular, the so-called “garrotting” cases, where someone strangles someone else, often using their arm or a length of wire, cord, or cloth, seemed to touch the rawest nerve with the people of London, with the fear of garrotting reaching a fever-pitch in the 1860s. The weird thing about garrotting and how widely it was reported at the time is that it doesn’t actually appear to have been all that common; even during the supposed height of the “garrotting panic of 1862”. So why the panic? As it turns out, although garrotting itself was never a major problem in London, newspapers from the era positively loved reporting on it. This led to the few isolated cases that did happen being blown way out of proportion and reported on to such an extent that the people of London were led to believe the streets were filled to the brim with roving rabbles of ruffians armed with lengths of wire."
 britain.25.a: "Interesting"
 britain.26.t: "\"A journey through space\""
 britain.26.d: "A very renowned scientist from Scotland named William Leitch has recently published an essay named \"A journey through space\" in which he introduces an entirely new concept: The use of rockets, as would be used in artillery, to travel \"outside the bounds of earth and through space\"! Dreamers and technological enthusiasts are up in arms debating about the feasibility of this, but with how rocketry has been practiced and not changed for the last few centuries, experts estimate there is probably no chance of something like this being ever possible."
 britain.26.a: "What a ridiculous proposal!"
 britain.26.b: "If nothing else, it serves as a nice reminder to divert funding into rocket artillery technology."
 britain.27.t: "Pince Consort Albert"
 britain.27.d: "Whereas there was this day read at the Board the draft of Letters Patent, conferring upon His Royal Highness Prince Albert the title and dignity of Prince Consort. Her Majesty, having taken the same into consideration, was pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privacy Council, to approve thereof, and to order, as it is hereby ordered, that the Right Honourable Sir George Grey, Baronet, one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, do cause a Warrant to be prepared for Her Majesty's signature, for passing Letters Patent conformable to the said draft under the Great Seal of Great Britain."
 britain.27.a: "The London Gazette publishes the news"
 britain.28.t: "Pince Consort Albert illness"
 britain.28.d: "The Prince Consort Albert fell seriously ill with stomach cramps. It was not an isolate event, the Prince suffers with chronic stomach troubles. He will continue to help the Queen Victoria in her duties."
 britain.28.a: "God save the Prince"
 #britain.29.t: REMOVED
 #britain.30.t: REMOVED
 #britain.31.t: REMOVED
 britain.32.t: "Esteemed Veterans Awarded"
 britain.32.d: "Her Majesty the Queen today, in Hyde-Park, graciously introduced and awarded sixty-six of the first ever Victorian Crosses. Established in January of the previous year, this military award is given only to Britain's most brave and most gentleman of warriors. Who, in troubled times, stood with absolute valour in the face of absolute war. How better can one present such an honor then on a humble bronze cross, passionately decorated with the Lion of this nation, beneath which reads a simple but imposing declaration…"
 britain.32.a: "For Valour."
 britain.33.t: "Religious Riots in Ireland"
 britain.33.d: "Belfast's streets and walls run red with blood as the Irish-Catholics, Irish-Protestants, and local police clash. Our reports suggest that the police did in fact side with the Irish-Protestants, no doubt to show support for the shining Union we have with our green isle neighbors. The beloved [and calming] “Roaring” Hugh Hanna was present at the clashes, and many have quoted him as having exacerbated the situation by calling for violence and anti-catholic bigotry. If I were to give my professional opinion on this accusation, as an objective journalist of our Great Britain, I would have to conclude that such a thing is abhorrent. I would expect nothing less from those blessed by our stabling hand but swear fidelity to Rome. Elsewhere, in Derry, Portatown, and Lurgan, blood also runs."
 britain.33.a: "And this is how they thank us?"
 britain.34.t: "Mendelssohn's Wedding March"
 britain.34.d: "For the esteemed guests of Princess Victoria and Prince Friedrich's marriage ceremony at the austere St. James's Palace, a new melody graced their ears that, unbeknownst to them, would gain such cultural power that it would be played at nearly every wedding on the planet. This is but one among many examples of how reaching British culture is to this day. Though the sun may have already set on their empire, Britain is still due much respect for the music, language, clothing, and philosophies she helped to spread."
 britain.34.a: "They can keep their wedding songs, and mashed peas for all I care."
 britain.35.t: "The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty"
 britain.35.d: "We and the Americans have long debated the status of the Mosquito Coast in Central America. We have long held that since this part of Central America is part of our colony Belize, and the Americans have in the past tolerated our settlement there, they should tolerate this as well. They are of the opinion this is a separate matter entirely, and want to restore these lands to their 'rightful owners' Honduras and Nicaragua. Should we acede to these demands?"
 britain.35.a: "Why keep such a disease-ridden place?"
 britain.35.b: "We will not give up our historical claims!"
 britain.36.t: "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
 britain.36.d: "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a novel written by English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells of a young girl named Alice, who fell through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. Alice in Wonderland was published in 1865, three years after Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed in a boat, on 4 July 1862 (this popular date of the "golden afternoon" might be a confusion or even another Alice-tale, for that particular day was cool, cloudy and rainy), up the Isis with the three young daughters of Henry Liddell: Lorina Charlotte Liddell (aged 13, born 1849) ("Prima" in the book's prefatory verse); Alice Pleasance Liddell (aged 10, born 1852) ("Secunda" in the prefatory verse); Edith Mary Liddell (aged 8, born 1853) ("Tertia" in the prefatory verse)."
 britain.36.a: "An Excellent Read"
 britain.37.t: "The National Society for Women's Suffrage"
 britain.37.d: "The National Society for Women's Suffrage was the first national group in the United Kingdom to campaign for women's right to vote. Formed on 6 November 1867, by Lydia Becker, the organisation helped lay the foundations of the women's suffrage movement. Eliza Wigham, Jane Wigham and some of their friends set up an Edinburgh chapter of this National Society. Eliza and her friend Agnes McLaren became the secretaries. The national society was furthered later by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and the Women's Social and Political Union."
 britain.37.a: "Close it!"
 britain.37.b: "Support it!"
 britain.38.t: "Nature's first scientific journal"
 britain.38.d: "The enormous progress in science and mathematics during the 19th century was recorded in journals written mostly in German or French, as well as in English. Britain underwent enormous technological and industrial changes and advances particularly in the latter half of the 19th century. In English the most respected scientific journals of this time were refereed journals of the Royal Society, which had published many of the great works from Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday through to early works from Charles Darwin. In addition, during this period, the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s.The publications were designed to serve as "organs of science", in essence, a means of connecting the public to the scientific world."
 britain.38.a: "Great to know."
 britain.39.t: "England vs Scotland Football match"
 britain.39.d: "First detailed description of football was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday. Before the first meeting of the Football Association in The Freemasons' Tavern on Great Queen Street, London on 26 October 1863, there were no universally accepted rules for playing football. Six meetings near London's Covent Garden, at 81-82 Long Acre, ended in a split between the Football Association and what would have become the future rugby ten years later. Both of them had their own uniforms, rituals, gestures and highly formalised rules. Between 1870 and 1872, the Football Association (FA) organised five representative association football matches between teams representing England and Scotland, all held in London. The first of these matches was held at The Oval on 5 March 1870."
 britain.39.a: "Scotland won!"
 britain.39.b: "Draw."
 britain.39.c: "England won!"
 britain.40.t: "British Red Cross Founded"
 britain.40.d: " On 4 August 1870, after a public meeting, the 'British National Society for Aid to the Sick and Wounded in War' was formed. It assisted in providing aid to both warring armies in the Franco-Prussian War and subsequent 19th-century conflicts, under the protection of the Red Cross Emblem. The society was one of several British volunteer medical organisations to serve in the war."
 britain.40.a: "Safety of our soldiers is important!"
 britain.41.t: "A Victory Monument for the Crimean War?"
 britain.41.d: "There have been propositions to build a grand victory monument dedicated to the Crimean War in London, but no one is quite sure if we can afford it right now. We need to make a decision."
 britain.41.a: "Have it be built!"
 britain.41.b: "We can't spend money on this right now."
 britain.42.t: "The Hartley Colliery Disaster"
 britain.42.d: "A tunnel collapse in a colliery in Hartley has led to a huge disaster as many working men and boys perished within the collapsing tunnels. The disaster has also rendered the colliery unable to run, and we would need to repair the damage in order to use it again. What shall be done?"
 britain.42.a: "Send them aid."
 britain.42.b: "There's nothing we can do."
 britain.43.t: "Return the Ionion Islands?"
 britain.43.d: "The Treaty of Paris in 1815 turned the islands into the "United States of the Ionian Islands" under British protection. In January 1817, the British granted the islands a new constitution. The islanders elected an Assembly of 40 members, who advised the British High Commissioner. The British greatly improved the islands' communications, and introduced modern education and justice systems. The islanders welcomed most of these reforms, and took up afternoon tea, cricket and other English pastimes.\n\nOnce Greek independence was established after 1830, however, the islanders began to press for Enosis union with Greece. William Ewart Gladstone toured the islands and recommended that having already Malta, giving the islands to Greece would not hurt the interest of the British Empire. The British government resisted, since like the Venetians they found the islands made useful naval bases.\n\nHowever, if the Islands are transfered to Greece, it would bring great popularity to the Greek government and put us in their favour. If we do this, it will take few weeks to officially return the Islands."
 britain.43.a: "Keep the Islands"
 britain.43.b: "Transfer them to Greece"
 britain.44.t: "Great Sheffield Flood"
 britain.44.d: "Tonight, the Dale Dyke Dam in Bradfield Dale collapsed while being filled for the first time which led to a gigantic surge of water flooding the Loxley Valley. The area is devastated, and lots of infrastructure has been destroyed."
 britain.44.a: "Send help to the affected."
 britain.44.b: "The area will eventually recover."
 britain.45.t: "\"The Salvation Army\""
 britain.45.d: "In London's east end, a new movement has been forming for the last couple of days - the \"Salvation Army\". Dedicated to get poor people out of jobs like prostitution and introducing them to Christianity by providing them aid, this institution is modeled after an army - even having its own flags and songs."
 britain.45.a: "A good initiative!"
 britain.46.t: "The Matterhorn is climbed!"
 britain.46.d: "After eight failed attempts, the Matterhorn has finally been climbed for the first time - by an Englishman! Edward Whymper and his party have managed the ascent up the dangerous scaling cliffs - and earned prestige for [ENG.GetNameDef] while doing so."
 britain.46.a: "Hooray!"
 britain.47.t: "[ENG.GetNameDef]'s first female doctor"
 britain.47.d: "Our countries first female doctor has graduated from university a few days ago. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson is seen by many as a controversial figure, by some as a role model and by some as a travesty. Either way, one more doctor surely can't hurt our nation."
 britain.47.a: "Remarkable."
 britain.48.t: "Colliery Explosion Disaster in Oaks!"
 britain.48.d: "The worst colliery catastrophe in recorded history so far has taken place in [ENG.GetNameDef] today, as a gigantic explosion occurred in an underground shaft while many were working down there. Reports say the neighborhood around Oaks felt the rumbling for three more minutes after the fact. A terrible disaster for Yorkshire."
 britain.48.a: "Do what we can do to aid the survivors."
 britain.48.b: "Well, that place won't be running again anytime soon."
 britain.49.t: "Alfred Nobel invents Dynamite!"
 britain.49.d: "A renowned engineer in our country by the name of Alfred Nobel has come up with a revolutionary new invention: \"Dynamite\". This appliance can be lit on a fuse and then unleashes unprecedented explosive power a few seconds later. It will surely have its uses in both warfare and mining..."
 britain.49.a: "This has potential..."
 britain.50.t: "Public Hanging of a Fenian Bomber"
 britain.50.d: "An Irish troublemaker by the name of Michael Barrett will be hanged today in response to the terror he spread as part of his activities in the Fenian Brotherhood, an organization of rebels fighting for Irish seperatism."
 britain.50.a: "Let this be a warning to the Irish."
 britain.50.b: "Use him to justify repression in Ireland."
 britain.51.t: "A new element discovered: \"Helium\""
 britain.51.d: "Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, has just observed a new element, which he gave the name \"Helium\", after the Greek \"Helios\", meaning \"The Sun\". It was observed as a yellow line in the solar spectrum - similar observations had been made by a French astronomer earlier this year, but it led to nothing concrete - until now."
 britain.51.a: "We are only just beginning to uncover the scientific realities of our world."
 britain.52.t: "The British Empire — 1857"
 britain.52.d: "The British Empire was a worldwide system of complex dependencies, colonies, protectorates, and other territories brought under the sovereignty of the crown of Great Britain and the administration of the British government.\n\nAlthough the Empire is at its height of power, many issues still loom over us. Most significantly, the current Sepoy Mutiny is a rebellion that began on May 10th, 1856, in the East India Company's garrisoned town of Meerut, just northeast of Delhi. Many more civilian and army mutiny outbreaks erupted following the one in Meerut, chiefly in the upper Gangetic and central Indian regions. Incidents of revolt were not limited to only central India, as others occurred farther north and east.\n\nThe Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and the summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as skepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. The rebellion and unrest of the populace pose a considerable threat to British power in that region. If our forces are unable to deal with this threat, our position as the globe's greatest power will be questionable—both at home and abroad…\n\nWith the dawn of the industrial revolution, many advancements in technology and changes in society must be made to stay ahead, and an issue that arose from it is major socialist union uprisings and their problems with low wages and unsafe working conditions. Another problem added to tower. Similarly, the status of Ireland has been in question in recent years. With increasing unrest in the region, over time, we will face the issue of how to deal with this situation to ensure a clean and bloodless outcome to Irish resentment.\n\nCaution will become the norm in the coming years ahead. Many decisions will turn the gears of the 20th century, and importantly, Britain's position in it. The tiniest blunder might set off a domino effect, with our great empire toppling along with it."
 britain.52.a: "God Save the Queen!"
 britain.53.t: "Lord Cupit"
 britain.53.d: "Some people called Palmerston a womaniser. The Times named him Lord Cupid (on account of his youthful looks), and he was cited, at the age of 79, as co-respondent in an 1863 divorce case. This scandal could harm our political situation."
 britain.53.a: "We will see"
 britain.54.t: "Lord Cupit - Scandal Prevails"
 britain.54.d: "The Scandal has shaken the trust in our Prime Minister."
 britain.54.a: "This is unacceptable"
 britain.55.t: "Lord Cupit - Scandal Exposed"

 britain.56.t: "Corrupt Elections"
 britain.56.d: "The 1865 general election was regarded by contemporaries as being a generally dull contest nationally, which exaggerated the degree of corruption within individual constituencies. In his PhD thesis, Cornelius O'Leary described The Times as having reported "the testimony is unanimous that in the General Election of 1865 there was more profuse and corrupt expenditure than was ever known before"."
 britain.56.a: "We have to act"
 britain.57.t: "Marriage of Princess Alice"
 britain.57.d: "Queen Victoria had expressed her wish that her children should marry for love, but this did not mean that her choice of suitors would necessarily be extended to anybody outside the royal houses of Europe. The Queen instructed her daughter Victoria, to produce a list of eligible princes in Europe. Her search produced only three suitable candidates: the Prince of Orange; and Prince Albert of Prussia. The Prince of Orange recently journeyed to Windsor Castle so that Queen Victoria could look him over in person, but he proved unpalatable to Alice. The prince too showed little interest in Alice, despite strong pressure from his pro-British mother. Prince Albert, too, was spurned, with Prince Frederick of Prussia remarking that his cousin would not do for "one who deserves the very best". Louis of Hesse was also suggested, a minor German royal. Louis visited Windsor, the Prince and Alice got along together. However, the other two Princes would bring a much more powerful alliance compared to the minor German state. Who should Princess Alice marry? The Prince of Orange or Albert of Prussia for a powerful alliance or the Prince of Hesse for love?"
 britain.57.a: "Prince of Orange"
 britain.57.b: "Prince Albert of Prussia"
 britain.57.c: "Prince Louis of Hesse"
 britain.58.t: "Marriage of the Prince of Wales"
 britain.58.d: "In an effort to change his philandering ways, Her majesty the Queen would like to arrange a marriage for the Prince of Wales. The Queen has got the help of Princess Victoria who has found two suitable options: Princess Alexandria of Denmark, Victoria found her a perfect match for the Prince. However, this may cause issues with Prussia due to the rising tensions over Schleswig-Holstein. But could bring a strong alliance. The second possible option is Elizabeth of Wied, the Queen strongly favours Elizabeth but she is not to the Prince's "taste". Who should the Prince of Wales marry? The Princess of Denmark for which will likely end in a happy marriage but could cause issues with Prussia? Or Elizabeth of Wied to ensure we do not cause hostile tension between Britain and Prussia?"
 britain.58.a: "Alexandria Princess of Denmark"
 britain.58.b: "Elisabeth of Wied"
 britain.59.t: "Princess Helena Marriage"
 britain.59.d: "Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family. The marriage horrified the Princess of Wales who exclaimed: 'The Duchies belong to Papa.' The Crown Princess of Prussia, who had been a personal friend of Christian's family for many years, ardently supported the proposed alliance. Helena was happy with Christian and was determined to marry him."
 britain.59.a: "Congratulations"
 britain.60.t: "Princess Louise Marriage"
 britain.60.d: "Various suitors were proposed by the leading royal houses of Europe: Princess Alexandra proposed her brother, the Crown Prince of Denmark, but this would be unpopular in England. William, Prince of Orange, was also considered a suitor, but he had an extravagant lifestyle in Paris, where he lived openly with a lover. Louise viewed marriage to any prince as undesirable, she wished to marry John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, heir to the Dukedom of Argyll. No marriage between a daughter of a monarch and a British subject had been given official recognition since 1515. Who shall the Princess marry? One of the Princess which will cause major upset somewhere or the British subject which would be the first in over 300 years?"
 britain.60.a: "Crown Prince of Denmark"
 britain.60.b: "Prince Albert of Prussia"
 britain.60.c: "Prince of Orange"

 britain.62.t: "Prince Leopold Marriage"
 britain.62.d: "British monarchs should marry into other reigning Protestant families, Victoria suggested a meeting with Princess Helen Frederica, the daughter of George Victor, reigning Prince of Waldeck-Pyrmont. However, Leopald was very fond of Mary Baring, daughter of Lord Ashburton, but though she was equally fond of him. Who should the Prince marry? The German Princess or the Noblemans young daughter?"
 britain.62.a: "Princess Helen of Waldeck and Pyrmont"
 britain.62.b: "Mary Baring, daughter of Lord Ashburton"
 britain.63.t: "Princess Beatrice Marriage"
 britain.63.d: "When Beatrice, after returning from Darmstadt, told her mother she planned to marry, the Queen reacted with frightening silence. Although they remained side by side, the Queen did not talk to her for seven months, instead communicating by note. Queen Victoria's behaviour, unexpected even by her family, seemed prompted by the threatened loss of her daughter. The Queen regarded Beatrice as her 'Baby'. Subtle persuasions by the Princess of Wales and the Crown Princess of Prussia, who reminded her mother of the happiness that Beatrice had brought the Prince Consort, induced the Queen to resume talking to Beatrice. Queen Victoria consented to the marriage on condition that Henry give up his German commitments and live permanently with Beatrice and the Queen."
 britain.63.a: "Congratulations"

It remains to be seen how the situation will further develop."

 britain.64.b: "Their lawmakers are class traitors!"

This party, formerly the Whigs, was centralized around reducing the power of the Crown in favor of the Parliament.

 britain.82.d: "There is a division in our Liberal party. It is between the Two Terrible Old Men, Palmerston and Russel, and William Ewart Gladstone, a Peelite.

 britain.90.d: "Our government supports the idea of a German unification. However, what we do not approve of is the annexation of sovereign territory and German wars.

 britain.90.b: "Don't risk relations with the Prussians."
 britain.91.t: "Death of Mary Anne Disraeli"
 britain.91.d: "In the spring of 1872 Mary became seriously ill, and by May it was clear that she was dying of stomach cancer. She rallied sufficiently to take a summer tour through the Home Counties with her husband. In November she felt well enough to hold a small dinner party for their close friends; but her condition deteriorated and she died on 15 December, at the age of eighty."There was no care which she could not mitigate, and no difficulty which she could not face. She was the most cheerful and courageous woman I ever knew" her husband wrote after her death. His great adversary William Ewart Gladstone, who had liked Mary, wrote him a letter of condolence.

The troops that remained were cut off from orders and found themselves in frantic urban battles as red flags flew in the streets. The way to London lay open and the Rebel Army arrived to mop up whatever resistance remained leaving countless wealthy and aristocratic citizens trapped in the country. The Prime Minister announced that the government was ceasing armed resistance to the advancing “Traitors” for now, but that in the fullness of time Her Majesty’s government would return and restore order to Britain."

 britain.183.d: "Two Courses of Lectures is a book by English historian John Robert Seeley about the growth of the British Empire. Seeley argued that the British expansion was based on its defeat of Louis XIV's France in the 18th century, and that the Dominions were critical to English power. He also stated that holding onto India might not be beneficial to England in the long run. The book was a popular success and received a strongly positive response from British politicians and nobility, and several historians have stated that it had great impact upon British thinking.\n\nSeeley famously remarked that "We seem, as it were, to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind". Seeley noted that it was possible for the Dominions to become independent of Britain, "Such a separation would leave England on the same level as the states nearest to us on the Continent, populous, but less so than Germany and scarcely equal to France. But two states, Russia and the United States, would be on an altogether higher scale of magnitude, Russia having at once, and the United States perhaps before very long, twice our population". However, he also stated that; "The other alternative is that England may prove able to do what the United States does so easily, that is, hold together in a federal union countries very remote from each other. In that case England will take rank with Russia and the United States in the first rank of state, measured by population and area, and in a higher rank that the states of the Continent"."

 britain.184.t: "Trooping the Colour"
 britain.184.d: "Regimental flags of the British Army were historically described as ‘Colours’ because they displayed the uniform Colours and insignia worn by the soldiers of different units. The name ‘Colour’ continues to be used to this day. The principal role of a regiment’s Colours was to provide a rallying point on the battlefield.\n\nIf troops were to know what their Regiment’s Colours looked like, it was necessary to display them regularly. The way in which this was done was for young officers to march in between the ranks of troops formed up in lines with the Colours held high. This is the origin of the word ‘trooping’. So, what today is a great tradition began life as a vital and practical parade designed to aid unit recognition before a battle commenced.\n\nThe Guards are among the oldest regiments of the British Army and have served as the personal bodyguards of The Sovereign since the monarchy was restored after the English Civil War in 1660. The ceremony of Trooping the Colour is believed to have been performed first during the reign of King Charles II. In 1748, it was decided that this parade would be used to mark the official birthday of the Sovereign and it became an annual event after George III became King in 1760.\n\nToday, this colourful spectacular remains a celebration of the Sovereign’s official birthday.

It established local education authorities with defined powers, authorized public money to improve existing schools, and tried to frame conditions attached to this aid so as to earn the goodwill of managers. It was long been seen as a milestone in educational development, but recent commentators have stressed that it brought neither free nor compulsory education, and its importance has thus tended to be diminished rather than increased.[The law was drafted by William Forster, a Liberal MP, and it was introduced on 17 February 1870 after campaigning by the National Education League, although not entirely to their requirements. In Birmingham, Joseph Chamberlain, not yet a Member of Parliament, was a prominent campaigner on the issue. However, like many grassroots Liberals he opposed the bill because it was open to the possibility of subsidising Church of England schools with local ratepayers' money."

Furthermore, this fits with the Liberal Party’s disestablishmentarianism. That is, the belief that the Church of England should no longer be the official Church of England, Wales, and Ireland. In opposition to this act are the conservatives, whose anti-disestablishmentarianism is legendary under Elizabeth’s tower.

Many a rebellion have had to be put down up to today, and rising republican sentiments among the native Irish have recently been fanned by a major independence movement calling themselves the 'Fenians'. Their message of demanding an Irish nation free from Great Britain has proven very appealing to our Irish subjects.\n\nTheir message of achieving this through violence, however, has proven to be a major headache for our Governor. The sporadic and violent attacks by the Fenian Brotherhood has been a major blow to the stability of the region. What needs to be done to quell these ever increasing demands, we will have to decide for ourselves...\n\n Current Unrest: §R[?Root.ENG_irish_unrest]§!\n Current Fenian Informants: [?ENG_IRE_fenian_informants]"

The royal coffers will fund the trip, and a private ferry will take them to and from Ireland.\n \nThe journey will begin in Dublin and will include stops at a number of significant spots around the Irish mainland that have been hand-picked. They are scheduled to travel from the city of Dublin to Dundalk, a town close to Belfast, where they will visit Castle Roche. On the trip to Belfast, they are expected to visit the spectacular sight of the Giants' Causeway before entering the town. After that, they'll be transported to Londonderry and ultimately to Galway via carriage, where they're expected to go sightseeing at the Cliffs of Moher. They'll end their trip in the humble town of Cork, return to Dublin, and then take the boat back to Liverpool.\nAll that remains is the approval, or disapproval, of the visit..."

The amendment would make it so that feudal methods of tenanship be suspended, and would be replaced by legally binding contracts which, under Section 4, all leases after 12 months must be evidenced in writing in order to be enforced.\n\nThis proposal would allow for flexible dealing with land, and will also give us the ability to seize land that is not properly evidenced per law."

These riots are becoming a major issue to the regions stability..."

One in particular has been on the eyes of everyone. The raid in mention has ended in failure as royal soldiers are outnumbered by more groups of Irish rioters surrounding their position. A humiliating loss for the Crown."
 britainirishunrest.9.a: "A Terrible Loss for the Crown"
 britainirishunrest.10.t: "The Irish People"
 britainirishunrest.10.d: "Our constables of Division G in Dublin have noted a circulation of a new paper in the city. The paper, called 'The Irish People', writes critically of the established order in Ireland under Britain and offers to ship old papers with Irish nationalistic writings to addresses across Great Britain. Many of these papers are old publications we have previously suppressed; 'The Irish People' has clearly shown what side of the Irish question they are on, and it is not ours. Perhaps it is time for this publication to shut down?"
 britainirishunrest.11.t: "Arrest Gangs of Fenian Leaders" 
 britainirishunrest.11.d: "The word "Fenian" serves as an umbrella term for the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Fenian Brotherhood, secret political organizations dedicated to the establishment of an independent Irish Republic. A recent break-in by Crown police at a warehouse in Dublin resulted in the apprehension and imprisonment of 12 members of these groups. The facility was searched shortly before being abandoned. Against these barbarians, the crown wins."
 britainirishunrest.11.a: "Do it quick!"
 britainirishunrest.12.t: "Fenian uprising in Ireland"
 britainirishunrest.12.d: "Discontent in Ireland has been increasing over the years. It is now at its peak, we have some options on how we should deal with the issue.\nFirstly, we can crush any resistance to our rule in Ireland. However this wouldn't be a long term solution and we will likely have more issues in the future.\nSecondly, we can allow Irish Home Rule. Meaning an Irish legislature will be responsible for domestic affairs, but Britain retained overall legislative supremacy. Similarly, we can establish a Dual Monarchy. Ireland will be equal in status, having freedom of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown.\nThe final option would be to grant Ireland full independence, removing the risk of any further blood-shed. But of course, we would lose our prestige if we were to release a major part of the United Kingdom.\nHow should we proceed?"

 britainirishunrest.12.e: "Dualism!"
 britainirishunrest.13.t: "Ireland Regains its Independence"
 britainirishunrest.13.d: "Being Celtic and Roman-Catholic, the Irish people are seemingly different from the other people in the United Kingdom. But that did not stop the English from invading Ireland from the 12th Century onwards. With the Norman settlers from England came the English and protestant culture into Ireland, and the old Gaelic Ireland was replaced by the Norman Ireland, which eventually merged together to form a united Irish culture. Until the 16th century, Ireland had great autonomy, which was abolished after the (re-)conquest of the island by the English. Repressed by the British government, the Irish rebelled successfully and got their rights back, like in 1782, when their legislative independence was restored. Even though Great Britain and Ireland were then united into one Kingdom and the Irish Catholics were emancipated by several acts during the 19th Century, the Irish seperatists could not be stopped. Decisions like abolishing the Irish parliament in 1803 or events like the Great Famine during the last 1840s did not help either. In the end the British had to allow Ireland to govern themselves, after violence and unrest spiked during the last months and years. The British think that such a decision may help to calm down the difficult situation Ireland currently has. Why this may be true, it raises the question how Ireland will fare now that their independence was granted by Britain, but also, what consequences Britain will have, how the other people will react to the Irish independence." 
 britainirishunrest.13.a: "God Save Ireland..."
 britainirishunrest.14.t: "The Fenian rebellion threatens British rule"
 britainirishunrest.14.d: "In a stronger rebellion than anyone thought, the Irish brotherhood, also known as the Fenians, have risen in revolt.

 britainirishunrest.17.d: "The Unionist Government in Ireland have made many poor decisions lately. As a result of this, the people of Ireland have flocked to the Republican cause. The Unionist Government will surely lose power. They have asked us to assist them in retaining their power and restoring order in Ireland. Although it may be a costly operation, it will guarantee Ireland remains a part of the British Empire."

 britainirishunrest.18.t: "The Royal Tour — Dublin" 
 britainirishunrest.18.d: "Only a few hours prior, the Queen had traveled by ferry to Dublin, where she was greeted rather well by the locals. Her arrival was unfortunately met with rather thunderous clouds forming overhead, leaving their first day gloomy and muddy across the streets of Dublin. Many gathered around to catch a glimpse of their monarch the next day when the clouds had scattered and the sun beamed from the heavens. The Queen and her consort rode by carriage to St. Stephens Green, where they sat under the marvelously green trees that sprung overhead and the lake ahead, like a sea of emerald glistening in the sunlight, for afternoon tea and crumpets. Their ride to Dundalk is expected to arrive in only a few days, so they plan on spending their remaining time viewing the likes of Trinity College and the GPO Witness History Museum."
 britainirishunrest.18.a: "Have a safe trip to Dundalk!"
 britainirishunrest.19.t: "The Royal Tour — Dundalk"
 britainirishunrest.19.d: "The old stone of Castle Roche once stood as an impregnable fort, surrounded by a deep moat and strong walls. It is built upon a large rocky outcrop and commands extensive views of the surrounding countryside. Now, it is a shadow of its former self, its walls aching from age and the crumbled foundation turning to ruin. A secret passage once connected the castle to a round tower outpost, but it was blocked off by collapsing debris and dirt from the intense storms of centuries past. The Queen took a particular fancy to the old castle after she organized a carriage ride with her husband to see it for the afternoon. Locals said they were there for hours admiring the beauty of the structure. A few days later, they were seen at St. Patrick's Church, spectating a church session before heading off by train to Belfast."
 britainirishunrest.19.a: "An amazing reminder of history"
 britainirishunrest.20.t: "The Royal Tour — Belfast" 
 britainirishunrest.20.d: "The Queen and her family's arrival in Belfast brought great excitement from the locals; a true moment to cherish. Many loyalists cheered her name in the streets until her subsequent arrival at the home where she would be staying for their visit. The trip there was one of pleasant travel, stopping at many shops and paying for local tokens and trinkets from the blacksmiths and shop owners. Many underweight and malnourished older Irish threw disgruntled glances and spit at her carriage, but the Queen did not seem to take notice. The highlight would be their arrival at the Giant's Causeway, an area of about 40,000 interlocking basalt columns, the result of an ancient volcanic fissure eruption. Legend tells us it was two opposing giants who crafted the place before a duel, and once one was defeated, they fled across the Irish Sea, where they left identical basalt columns. Her Majesty's royal consort seemed pleasantly interested in the tale and location, as he would head down to where the fight was supposed to have taken place. Later, the ride to Londonderry was one of storms and thunder."
 britainirishunrest.20.a: "A sight to behold"
 britainirishunrest.21.t: "The Royal Tour — Londonderry" 
 britainirishunrest.21.d: "The arrival in Londonderry was swift and concise, as the pouring rain prevented any unplanned stops on their way to their vacation home. The Queen was reported to have spent the whole night reading about the history of the city walls of Londonderry, as that was their first stop the next morning. Londonderry is the only completely intact walled city in Ireland and one of the finest examples of a walled city in Europe. The walls constitute the largest monument in state care in Northern Ireland and, as part of the last walled city to be built in Europe, stand as the most complete and spectacular. It is one of the few cities in Europe that never saw its fortifications breached, withstanding several sieges, including the famous Siege of Derry in 1689, which lasted 105 days, hence the city's nickname, The Maiden City. Like at their earlier stop at Roche Castle, they spent hours marveling over the walls surrounding the city. After stops at local shops and lunch at an exquisite restaurant, they carried on with their journey to Galway."
 britainirishunrest.21.a: "Have a safe trip to Galway!" 
 britainirishunrest.22.t: "The Royal Tour — Galway"
 britainirishunrest.22.d: "The carriage ride from Londonderry to Galway was deemed an excellent adventure by the family as they passed through the likes of the enchanting forest of Benbulben. Galway was no different from Londonderry, save for the rain. Their arrival was met without much excitement, but that was fine for the royal family, as they planned to spend their visit far away, atop a rather secluded home on the Cliffs of Moher. From the cliffs and from atop a tower, visitors can see the Aran Islands in Galway Bay, the Maumturks and Twelve Pins mountain ranges to the north in County Galway, and Loop Head to the south. Because none of the children were permitted to see the ever-expanding overhang of the cliffs from above except from afar, they spent their time at the bottom bemused by the variety of animals that could be seen; grey seals, porpoises, dolphins, minke whales, and basking sharks, as well as, on occasion, sunfish. The Queen and her consort spent most of their time under the shade of trees, dining on local dishes like local cattle and the delicate dish of Irish hare. The train ride to Cork was well spent by the family as they viewed the flat plains of the Irish countryside."
 britainirishunrest.22.a: "A once in a lifetime view"
 britainirishunrest.23.t: "The Royal Tour — Cork" 
 britainirishunrest.23.d: "The humble town of Cork offered their finest home to the family as they arrived early and the house expected could not give in to their original offer. The family first stopped for groceries at the English Market, a municipal food market in the center of Cork City. It stretches from Princes Street to the Grand Parade and combines Princes Street Market and the Grand Parade Market. After feeling at home with the comforts of proper English food and items, they headed to the Glenview Gardens. The front garden contains a sunken white garden, an Italianate canal, and a Japanese garden. The boundary wisteria walk opens out into the bog garden and woodland area, from where a tea house enjoys a view of the Mediterranean and tropical gardens. A wander over to the birch mound, which is surrounded by the wildflower meadow, into the walled kitchen garden to view the seasonal vegetables. The gorgeous looks of countless other cultures humbled the family as they took the carriage and headed off back to Dublin for the ferry home."
 britainirishunrest.23.a: "Have a safe trip to Dublin!"
 britainirishunrest.24.t: "The Royal Tour — Return to Dublin" 
 britainirishunrest.24.d: "Upon the Queen's return to Dublin, the welcome of her return was not as well-received as many turned away or looked disgusted at her arrival in the city. The Royal Family, poignantly, was met by unexpected visitors who gave them gifts and goodbyes, requesting them to make their return soon as they had shed good light on unionists and lifted the spirits of the many people they had passed. The ferry back to Liverpool was short and without interruption by bad weather, as the Royal family retreated to their home in London."

The recent trends have had ramming be the go-to attack against armored ships, but a recent development in the 'Mark Cannon' has finally allowed for the ability to deal with armored ships at a safer distance.\n\nIt's critical we push ahead with these guns immediately, lest we be pushed out of the oceans!"
 ENG_focus_armstrong_cannon: "Armstrong Cannon"
 ENG_focus_armstrong_cannon_desc: "Our war-time experiences from the Crimean War have shown that British guns in stock are severely outdated, some being built as far back as the Napoleonic Wars. This cannot stand, for neither the Army or the Navy! We've established a commission for a new gun-design to replace our current fleet of guns. One commission provider, Sir William Armstrong, has proposed ideas of a breach-loading gun. Should we give him the contract?"
 ENG_focus_commision_monitors: "Commision Monitors"
 ENG_focus_commision_monitors_desc: "The USS Monitor design by John Ericsson for the Union Navy has seen the implementation of interesting characteristics not found in our current fleet. The ship's hull is low in the water, and fully constructed of metal armor. It is without masts, fully engine-powered and fashions a single armored gun turret.\n\nThe ship's successful usage against the CSA Navy makes developing some ships of our own an appealing prospect..."
 ENG_focus_commision_ironside_frigates: "Commision Ironside Frigates"
 ENG_focus_commision_ironside_frigates_desc: "The implementation of armored plating onto our warships must not only happen for our greater warships! We must also make an effort to add armor to our frigates aswell. The added armor will make them more resistant to enemy fire, as wooden hulls are no longer viable due to being easily damaged by gunfire."
 ENG_focus_new_ships: "New ships"
 ENG_focus_new_ships_desc: "While the development of guns, armor and propulsion is certainly important, we must not forget to also look into how to best incorporate them into our ships! New ship designs, incorporating the newest inventions and discoveries of naval engineering, must be developed as to best make effective use of our new technology."
 ENG_focus_newer_engines: "New engines"
 ENG_focus_newer_engines_desc: "The steam engine has proven to be a valuable asset in naval propulsion, but has some clear shortcomings aswell. The space required for housing the engines is great, and the pressure that these engines can handle is still not sufficient for greater speeds. We must look into improving these engines, as to make them more reliable, smaller and more powerful."
 ENG_focus_listen_to_coles: "Listen to Coles"
 ENG_focus_listen_to_coles_desc: "Coles was the one who introduced us first to the abilities of the gun turret, and his design was proven to be feasible at the siege of Taganrog. His design is more technologically advanced than that of Ericsson's, though perhaps the simplicity of Ericsson's design is what we need instead?"
 #ENG_focus_ericsson_is_right: "Ericsson is right"
 #ENG_focus_ericsson_is_right_desc: "John Ericsson, the designer of the USS Monitor and a rival contender for the gun turret patent, has extensive practical experience with building ships with these turrets. His design is simpler than that of Coles, but lacks some sophistication. Ericsson's design is sound, but perhaps Coles' iteration of the idea is better suited for our needs?"
 #ENG_focus_listen_to_watts: "Listen to Watts"
 #ENG_focus_listen_to_robinson: "Listen to Robinson"
 ENG_focus_coles_turrets: "Coles' Turrets"
 ENG_focus_coles_turrets_desc: "We know Coles' gun turret design first-hand from his actions in the Crimean War. They have proven to be effective when used, but only on a small raft. If we are to implement his turrets onto our actual warships, some design tweaks have to be made. Despite this, the turrets have great potential ahead if implemented correctly."
 ENG_focus_ericsson_turrets: "Ericsson's Turrets"
 ENG_focus_ericsson_turrets_desc: "Ericsson made a good show of his turrets in their action aboard the USS Monitor in the US Civil War. Unlike Coles' turrets these are already designed for, and fitted to, regular warships. They are simpler and less reliable, but they have shown to function well-enough in battle."
 ENG_focus_watts_machines: "Watts' Machines"
 ENG_focus_watts_machines_desc: "Watts favours light hulls with good speed in his ships, and get that speed he has deviced an improved steam engine that can handle greater pressures than ever before. With the use of improved boilers and more effective steam usage by better design, these engines can produce power that propell our ships quickly!"
 ENG_focus_robinson_hulls: "Robinson's Hulls"
 ENG_focus_robinson_hulls_desc: "Robinson's armored hull designs are slightly slower than regular ships, but are more heavily armored and armed. Using clever distribution of iron and brass plates, these armor designs can protect the ship and her crew from most shell types of the day while firing back with impunity."

 #Country Leader Descriptions
 ENG_desc_queen_vic: "Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (the fourth son of King George III), and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. After the deaths of her father and grandfather in 1820, she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller, John Conroy. She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father's three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue. Though a constitutional monarch, Victoria privately attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality."
 ENG_desc_palmerston: "Henry Temple succeeded to his father's Irish peerage (which did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords, leaving him eligible to sit in the House of Commons) as the 3rd Viscount Palmerston in 1802. He became a Tory MP in 1807. From 1809 to 1828 he served as Secretary at War, organising the finances of the army. He first attained Cabinet rank in 1827, when George Canning became prime minister, but like other Canningites, he resigned from office one year later. He served as foreign secretary 1830–1834, 1835–1841, and 1846–1851. In this office, Palmerston responded effectively to a series of conflicts in Europe."
 ENG_desc_edward_smithstanley: "The Stanleys were a long-established and very wealthy landowning family whose principal residence was Knowsley Hall in Lancashire. He was perhaps the richest prime minister ever."
 ENG_desc_william_lovett: "A proponent of the idea that political rights could be garnered through political pressure and non-violent agitation, Lovett retired from more overt forms of political activity after a year of imprisonment on the political charge of seditious libel in 1839–1840. He subsequently devoted himself to the National Association for Promoting the Political and Social Improvement of the People, seeking to improve the lives of the poor workers and their children by means of a Chartist educational programme put into practice."
 ENG_desc_disraeli: "Disraeli was born in Bloomsbury, then a part of Middlesex. His father left Judaism after a dispute at his synagogue; Benjamin became an Anglican at the age of 12. After several unsuccessful attempts, Disraeli entered the House of Commons in 1837. In 1846 the prime minister at the time, Sir Robert Peel, split the party over his proposal to repeal the Corn Laws, which involved ending the tariff on imported grain. Disraeli clashed with Peel in the House of Commons, becoming a major figure in the party. When Lord Derby, the party leader, thrice formed governments in the 1850s and 1860s, Disraeli served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons."
 ENG_desc_salisbury: "Lord Robert Cecil was first elected to the House of Commons in 1854 and served as Secretary of State for India in Lord Derby's Conservative government 1866–1867. In 1874, under Disraeli, Salisbury returned as Secretary of State for India, and, in 1878, was appointed foreign secretary, and played a leading part in the Congress of Berlin. After Disraeli's death in 1881, Salisbury emerged as Conservative leader in the House of Lords, with Sir Stafford Northcote leading the party in the Commons."
 ENG_desc_john_russel: "The third son of the 6th Duke of Bedford, Russell was educated at Westminster School and Edinburgh University before entering Parliament in 1813. In 1828 he took a leading role in the repeal of the Test Acts which discriminated against Catholics and Protestant dissenters. He was one of the principal architects of the Reform Act 1832, which was the first major reform of Parliament since the Restoration, and a significant early step on the road to democracy and away from rule by the aristocracy and landed gentry. He favoured expanding the right to vote to the middle classes and enfranchising Britain's growing industrial towns and cities but he never advocated universal suffrage and he opposed the secret ballot. Russell was outspoken on many issues over the course of his career, advocating Catholic emancipation in the 1820s, calling for the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1845, denouncing Pope Pius IX's revival of Catholic bishoprics in 1850, and supporting Italian unification during the 1860s."
 ENG_desc_gladstone: "Gladstone was born in Liverpool to Scottish parents. He first entered the House of Commons in 1832, beginning his political career as a High Tory, a grouping which became the Conservative Party under Robert Peel in 1834. Gladstone served as a minister in both of Peel's governments, and in 1846 joined the breakaway Peelite faction, which eventually merged into the new Liberal Party in 1859. He was chancellor under Lord Aberdeen (1852–1855), Lord Palmerston (1859–1865) and Lord Russell (1865–1866). Gladstone's own political doctrine—which emphasised equality of opportunity and opposition to trade protectionism—came to be known as Gladstonian liberalism. His popularity amongst the working-class earned him the sobriquet "The People's William"."
 ENG_desc_cavendish: "After joining the special mission to Russia for Alexander II's accession, Lord Cavendish of Keighley (as he was styled at the time) entered Parliament in the 1857 general election, when he was returned for North Lancashire as a Liberal (his title "Lord Hartington", by which he became known in 1858, was a courtesy title; as he was not a peer in his own right he was eligible to sit in the Commons until he succeeded his father as Duke of Devonshire in 1891). Between 1863 and 1874, Lord Hartington held various Government posts, including Civil Lord of the Admiralty and Under-Secretary of State for War under Palmerston and Earl Russell. In the 1868 general election he lost his seat; having refused the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland, he was made Postmaster-General, without a seat in the Cabinet. The next year he re-entered the Commons, having been returned for Radnor. In 1870 Hartington reluctantly accepted the post of Chief Secretary for Ireland in Gladstone's first government."
