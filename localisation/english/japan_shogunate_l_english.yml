  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.1.t: "The Tokugawa Shogunate"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.1.d_shogunate: "Ever since Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Japan has undergone an era of unprecedented unity, progress, and stability under his descendants' reign. This era, dubbed the Edo Period after the newly designated capital along the eastern seaboard, would be the beginning of Japan's complete withdrawal from the outside world, save for brief contacts with China and Korea. Under this strong stance of 'Sakoku' or isolation, Japan was able to resist the spread of Christianity and the overall encroachment of Western influences that were common throughout the rest of East Asia during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, only admitting an exception for the mercantile Dutch, who respected Japan's resolution to seclusion.\n \nThe times are changing for the Shogunate and the Bakufu Council that rules over Japan. The Pax Orientalis, or great peace of the east, is faltering as the Indies fall to western encroachment and the rule of the Great Qing weakens. Even worse, dignitaries from the United States, armed with a wrought iron fleet and giant cannons, demand the end of Japan's long-achieved independence and will burn Edo to the ground if necessary.\n \nIn a world increasingly shrinking, Japan must prepare to meet the challenge of a world ever alienating her interests, but internal factions are split on how she should face them. The Imperial House, which has long retreated from administration, demands that we not lose face and rush to meet the West with swords, but the Bakufu Council contends that Japan is not yet ready to meet a world that has advanced so quickly. Even worse, Shogun Iesada, the head of the state, is sickly and unconfident, weakening the morale and decisiveness of Japan and her people. With discontent growing and our days of negotiating dwindling, the Tokugawa shogunate may face its day of reckoning..."

  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.2.t: "Return of the Kokera?"
  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.2.d: "Two decades ago, the Kokera (Cholera) Disease entered our lands from the lands of India upon British merchant ships. While the disease has remained quiet since an initial epidemic in the late 1820s, Kyushu officials in recent reports have written of a similar sickness spreading among the peasants.\n \nThese reports come during at an inauspicious time, as our Bakufu Council looks to negotiate the next round of treaties with the Western Powers. Some of our elders warn that this plague is an effect of evil spirits purposely brought to Japan by the West while others believe it is Japan's spirits punishment on Kyushu's love for Western teachings. Either way, the Kokera of years past had brought much strife and sorrow to the peoples of Japan and the Tokugawan Shōgun is not anxious for another catastrophy during this time of crisis."

As many flee from the southern port, some Han Lords of the surrounding countryside have resorted to instruct their samurai to kill any refugees fleeing the in fear of the spreading curse.\n \nIt is important to contain this threat from spreading any further, but Nagasaki, one of Japan's few ports to the outside world is expected to remain open by treaties with the Western Powers. Closing and quarantining the port may also bring unexpected wrath from the West, poorly-timed as negotiations of more permanent trade treaties are still proceeding in Edo."

After little debate, Shogun Iesada's favored elder bakufu, Councilman Il Naosuke was selected as Tairo, a position of designated leader of the Bakufu Council which has remained unfilled since the 15th century.

It's age-old exchange rate of 5 Silver to 1 Gold, is outdated and in the eyes of governments and merchants abroad alike, a good deal, as global standards currently place the exchange rate at 11 SIlver for 1 Gold.

While this system has remain useful and preserving amicability with far flung daimyo clans during our years of isolation, the inform exchange rates of dozens of currencies combined with the weakening of Japan's Gold supply could lead to many domains unexpectedly bankrupt if foreign banks notice these flaws.\n \nThe elders in charge of market reforms propose the Shogunate introduce a more nationalized currency, and ask our daimyos to start switching to it.

  JAP_tokugawa_shogunate.91.d: "\nJapan celebrates [TSH.GetLeader], the current Shogun, and Princess Kazunomiya's union in Edo. This sixth marriage between Imperial members and shoguns aims to quell growing discord between the Imperial Court and Bakufu Council, addressing tensions heightened by Japan's recent reentry into global politics. The arrangement seeks to strengthen unity amid challenges, both internal and foreign.\n\nPrincess Kazunomiya's journey from the Imperial Court to Edo's political center faced issues due to stringent restrictions along the Nakasendo River, disrupting the bridal entourage's travel. Despite anticipated challenges, the 26-day journey concluded, reflecting changing dynamics as Tokugawa emperors assumed responsibility for potential damages.

 TSH_character_tokugawa_iesada_desc: "Born to weak health, Tokugawa Iesada was sheltered early in his life from the outside world to protect his health, and to make sure the only son and heir of Ieyoshi Shōgun could grow up to rule after him.\n\nIesada's rule has seen Japan be forced to open up to the outside world, and many catastrophic natural disasters that has ruined many cities and lives. His lack of participation in court life and rule of the Bakufu, paired with these disasters, have made his rule very unpopular among the common people. His perceived weakness and failure to protect Japan from foreign incursions have allowed his opponents to get the upper-hand."
 TSH_character_tokugawa_iemochi_desc: "14th Shogun of Tokugawa Shogunate.

Becoming the first shogun since Tokugawa Iemitsu in 1634 to travel to Kyoto. Shogun Iemochi tried to strengthen the power of the Shogunate and its ties to the Emperor. He then married Princess Kazu, daughter of Emperor Ninko as part of Kobbu Gattai which is an effort to strengthen ties between the Shogunate and the Emperor although Princess Kazu refused to use ‘Midaidokoro’ or “Official Wife of Shogun'' title. He also ended Sankin Kotai which weakened Shogun’s control over domains. His reign was also undermined by incompetent advisors. He died childless at a young age of 20 years old due to illness. But, he adopted a son, Tokugawa Iesato as his heir. At that time, he was only 3 years old, but as the Tokugawa Shogunate was at war with Chōshū, the adult Tokugawa Yoshinobu was appointed as the fifteenth Shogun."
