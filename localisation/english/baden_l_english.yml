### MISSIONS & DECISIONS ###

## ECONOMY & INDUSTRY
BAD_decision_category_economy: "The Economy of Baden"
BAD_decision_category_economy_desc: "The Industrial Revolution has finally reached our realm, but we have a lot of ground to make up to the big players like Great Britain or France. We have to speed up the industrializing process by all means to be able to catch up. On the surface it seems very simple investing in the modernization of our industry and the development of more advanced methods of production. The Big question is where should our priorities be?"
BAD_decision_enact_free_enterprise: "Enact Free Enterprise"
BAD_decision_enact_free_enterprise_desc: "We will need to adjust our laws in order to attract investors, as we have too harsh laws currently, which hamper the development of our economy. Liberialising the market is one thing we could do, as it would make us more attractive for investors."
BAD_decision_establish_an_industrial_code: "Establish an Industrial Code"
BAD_decision_establish_an_industrial_code_desc: "By establishing an industrial code we can give our businesses legal certainty. Doing so will hinder them doing things we do not want them to do, but in the long term this will raise their innovativeness and make up for problems in the short term."
BAD_mission_establish_lumber_industry: "Establish Lumber Industry"
BAD_mission_establish_lumber_industry_desc: "We need to make better use of our resources in order to industrialize our country faster. Our rich forest areas and the high-quality timber in our woods provide a good basis for promoting this process."
BAD_decision_expand_woodcutting_industry: "Expand Woodcutting Industry"
BAD_decision_expand_woodcutting_industry_desc: "We have a long tradition of logging and our rich forests are known for providing first-class lumber. Although we have to proceed with caution, we can increase our lumber production through smart investments."

BAD_decision_expand_mining_districts: "Expand Mining Districts"
BAD_decision_expand_mining_districts_desc: "We still have several untapped mineral deposits in our country. Some politicians do think that it is the best idea to expand existing mining destricts and opening up new mines will help our economy and attract new investors."
BAD_decision_establish_coal_mining: "Establish Coal Mining"
BAD_decision_establish_coal_mining_desc: "Although our country does not exactly have huge coal reserves, we could significantly increase coal production in the few mining areas through targeted investment."
BAD_decision_expand_farmlands: "Expand Farmlands"
BAD_decision_expand_farmlands_desc: "Agriculture has always been the backbone of our country. With its help, we have been able to avoid major famines and the surplus yield brings a lot of money into our coffers every year. If we continue to invest in more modern methods here and there and cultivate high-yield areas more efficiently, we can further increase our yields."
BAD_mission_establish_machine_engineering_industry: "Establish Machine Engineering Industry"
BAD_mission_establish_machine_engineering_industry_desc: "We have many bright minds in our country who have made a name for themselves, especially in the field of mechanical engineering. It is our task to support these men and capitalize on their achievements."

BAD_decision_watchmaking_industry_desc: "Black Forest watchmaking is renowned throughout Germany for its unrivaled quality.

BAD_decision_support_basf: "Support BASF"
BAD_decision_support_basf_desc: "Friedrich Engelhorn is a capable industrialist. His ideas for a large chemicals factory are interesting and we would do well to lend him our support."

BAD_decision_support_textile_industry_desc: "Baden has a rich history of proto-industrialized textile production. By investing into modern technology and expanding industrial capacities, the output of our textile industry could be greatly improved."
BAD_decision_subsidize_steel_mill: "Subsidize Construction of a Stell Mill"
BAD_decision_subsidize_steel_mill_desc: "We can expand our extraction of raw materials, but without processing them into higher-quality materials, we will do little with them. We should therefore subsidize the construction of a steel mill."
BAD_decision_subsidize_machine_parts_factory: "Subsidize Construction of a Machine Parts Factory"
BAD_decision_subsidize_machine_parts_factory_desc: "Our engineers have great ideas, but they often lack the resources to put their inventions into practice and make them marketable. We should therefore provide the necessary funding to support this industry."
BAD_decision_railway_upgrade: "Railway Upgrade"
BAD_decision_railway_upgrade_desc: "Our railway network is not up to the task of supporting let alone encouraging a modern industry anymore. Upgrading and expanding it would not only fix this problem, it would also grant our industry important contracts and the possibility for trade expansion."

BAD_decision_baden_central_bank_desc: "For a few years now, there have been discussions about the foundation of a central bank for the Grand Duchy of Baden. However, lawmakers are still not certain whether that would be feasible for a rather small country like ours. If we have the funds to spare, this endeavor could have positive effects on our economy though, making the necessary capital for investments of all sorts much more readily available without fear of a foreign influence on our finances."

### DESCRIPTIONS
BAD_FRIEDRICH_I_LEADER_DESC: "First sitting in the Baden Estates Assembly as an appointed parliamentarian and then serving as regent for four years due to his brother's poor mental health, Friedrich I became Grand Duke of Baden in 1856 - though his reign did not officially begin until 1858 upon his brother's death.\n\nFriedrich holds rather liberal leanings, and has the will and ability to enact significant social and political reforms. Being a supporter of a constitutional monarchy and rather reluctant to go to war, perhaps Friedrich I can be a relatively benevolent monarch who improves the lives of his citizens in an age of increasing anti-monarchy sentiment."
BAD_FRANZ_VON_STENGEL_LEADER_DESC: "Coming from a family of civil servants, Franz von Stengel himself worked in public service as a legal intern, state councillor, and a member of the Baden Estates Assembly. Most recently he has acted as Baden’s pseudo-Prime Minister as the head of the Stengel Cabinet.\n\nA Catholic and a relative conservative in an otherwise liberalizing era for Baden, von Stengel may be able to enact basic, non-ideological reforms and laws with little trouble but will likely find significant opposition to his pro-Catholic Church agenda."
BAD_ANTON_VON_STABEL_LEADER_DESC: "Born in the immediate aftermath of the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Anton Stabel's childhood was marked by significant political and military turmoil. Stabel embarked on a wildly successful career of civil service as a government lawyer and later judge, rising up the ranks of the legal profession from a relatively young age. While working as a judicial assistant, public prosecutor, university rector (president) and lecturer, as well as High Court vice-chancellor, he became a legal expert who was highly renowned in his field.\n\nStabel accepted a position as President of the Ministry for the Interior and Justice in the wake of the 1848 revolutions, and despite calls for a heavy-handed, reactionary response to the revolutions, he was at the forefront of a successful push for progressive reforms and judicial modernization. After being elected to the short-lived Erfurt Parliament in 1850, Stabel was appointed vice president of the Landstände where he has remained until becoming the head of state of a new, more liberal Baden.\n\nNow, Stabel has the opportunity to completely reform Baden to have one of the most modern legal systems in the world, and to generally turn Baden into one of the most liberal countries in Europe. Hopefully war does not prevent him from finishing what he started..."

### EVENTS ###
#General Politics Events
baden.1.t: "Grand Duke Friedrich I"
baden.1.d: "Grand Duke Friedrich I is the second son of Grand Duke Leopold of Baden. As Prince of the House of Baden, he sat in the First Chamber of the Baden Assembly of Estates from 1847 to 1852. Since his elder brother, Ludwig II, is terminally ill, he took over regency of the Grand Duchy after the death of his father in 1852. In 1856, he officially became Grand Duke himself.\n\nFriedrich I is said to have liberal views regarding his stance on politics and he is an advocate of a constitutional monarchy. He is married to the Prussian princess Luise, which could be of importance in terms of Baden's politics in regard to the German Confederation."
baden.1.a: "Alright."
baden.2.t: "The Stengel Cabinet"
baden.2.d: "The Stengel cabinet took over the government of the [BAD.GetName] in 1856, shortly before Friedrich I officially assumed the throne. The two leading cabinet ministers, Franz Freiherr von Stengel as Minister of the Interior and Justice, and Wilhelm Freiherr Rivalier von Meysenbug as Minister of the Exterior and the Grand Ducal Household, pursue a moderately conservative policy. The effects of the reactionary era are still noticeable, as is the conflict with the Catholic Church, which presents the government with major challenges. In any case, the young, more liberal Grand Duke will keep a close eye on the conservative ministers."
baden.2.a: "Ok."
baden.3.t: "The Stabel Cabinet"
baden.3.d: "The traditional liberal Anton Stabel has been commissioned by the Grand Duke to form a new government. Stabel is regarded as one of the pioneers of a moderate-liberal movement in Germany and was already part of the Baden government cabinet from 1849 to 1851. It was also Stabel who initiated the fall of the Stengel government by firmly insisting that the chambers of the Baden parliament had to approve the concordat with the Vatican. Consequently, he has now been called into responsibility by the Grand Duke and it will be interesting to see whether he can back up his words with deeds."
baden.3.a: "Ok."
baden.4.t: "The Grand Ducal Trade Ministry"
baden.4.d: "The new liberal government is determined to put the economic policy of the [BAD.GetName] on a new footing. To this end, Minister of State Anton Stabel has proposed the establishment of a Ministry of Trade, which is to set the essential course. Gideon Weizel is to take the lead as the responsible minister in this ministry, as he has proven his expertise in this area in numerous negotiations of the Zollverein."
baden.4.a: "Onwards!"

#Kulturkampf Events
baden.51.t: "A Treaty with the Catholic Church?"
baden.51.d: "The conflict with the Catholic Church has been occupying our country for several years now, and there is still no peace. It therefore seems appropriate to enter into negotiations with the Holy See in order to remedy this situation. If we do not find a solution, the problem could keep us busy for years to come. So, should we approach the Vatican?"
baden.51.a: "Request an agreement."
baden.51.b: "Continue with the status quo."
baden.52.t: "[BAD.GetNameDef] Requests an Agreement"
baden.52.d: "The Grand Duke of Baden asks us for an agreement in the dispute between the Catholic Church and the state institutions and the prerogatives of His Royal Majesty, Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden. This is a welcome opportunity to secure our influence in the [BAD.GetName]. How should we respond to his request?"
baden.52.a: "Agree to negotiate."
PAP_baden_kulturkampf_negotiations_effect_tt: "§GWe will have a chance of securing a lasting treaty that protects Catholic interests in the [BAD.GetName].§!\n\n"
baden.52.b: "There's no need to negotiate."
PAP_baden_kulturkampf_no_negotiations_effect_tt: "§RPoliticians in the [BAD.GetName] might see this as a provocation and could try to push public influence in the matters of the Catholic Church in the country even further.§!\n\n"
baden.53.t: "[PAP.GetNameDef] Willing to Negotiate"
baden.53.d: "The Vatican has expressed its willingness to negotiate a solution to our dispute with the Catholic Church. An agreement is definitely considered possible. It is now up to us to make an offer. How should we proceed?"
baden.53.a: "Make an acceptable offer."
BAD_baden_kulturkampf_acceptable_offer_effect_tt: "§GThis will make an agreement with the Vatican almost certain.§!\n\n"
baden.53.b: "Make an audacious offer."
BAD_baden_kulturkampf_audacious_offer_effect_tt: "§RRejection of our offer is almost certain. This could, however, give us pretense to act more firmly against the Catholic Church.§!\n\n"
baden.54.t: "[PAP.GetNameDef] Rejects Negotiation"
baden.54.d: "The Vatican has rejected our request for negotiations to settle the Kulturkampf. It seems that the Catholic Church is not willing to compromise on this issue. We must therefore decide how to proceed."
baden.54.a: "They choose to fight, we get it."
baden.55.t: "[BAD.GetNameDef] Makes an Acceptable Offer"
baden.55.d: "After we had signaled our willingness to negotiate, the government of the [BAD.GetName] sent us an offer. The proposal essentially corresponds to what we can expect in these negotiations. If we accept it, the prerogatives of the Catholic Church in Baden will be largely recognized and the autonomy of church institutions will be extended. How should we respond?"
baden.55.a: "Accept their offer."
baden.55.b: "Reject their offer."
baden.56.t: "[BAD.GetNameDef] Makes an Audacious Offer"
baden.56.d: "After we had signaled our willingness to negotiate, the government of the [BAD.GetName] sent us an offer. Unfortunately, the offer falls far short of what we expected. If we accept, the prerogatives of the Catholic Church in Baden will be restricted and the autonomy of church institutions will be largely abolished. However, we can expect that a rejection on our part could be accompanied by a tightening of the measures against the Catholic Church in Baden. So how should we react?"
baden.56.a: "Accept their offer."
baden.56.b: "Reject their offer, we need to fight this."
baden.57.t: "[PAP.GetNameDef] Agrees to the Convention"
baden.57.d: "The Vatican has accepted our offer of an amicable settlement in the Kulturkampf conflict with the Catholic Church. We can now conclude a convention and ratify the agreement."
baden.57.a: "Good news."
baden.58.t: "[PAP.GetNameDef] Rejects the Convention"
baden.58.d: "The Vatican has rejected our offer of an amicable settlement in the Kulturkampf conflict with the Catholic Church. We must now decide how we should proceed."
baden.58.a: "Make a more acceptable offer."
baden.58.b: "We got what we came for."
baden.58.c: "So be it."
baden.59.t: "The Concordat of [GetYear]"
baden.59.d: "The Concordat of 1859 should enable us to settle the dispute with the Catholic Church in the foreseeable future and to return to orderly conditions."
