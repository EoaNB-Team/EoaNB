BAD_decision_category_economy: "The Economy of Baden"
BAD_decision_category_economy_desc: "Die Industrielle Revolution hat endlich auch unser Land erreicht, aber wir haben gegenüber den Großmächten wie Großbritannien oder Frankreich einen großen Rückstand aufzuholen. Wir müssen den Industrialisierungsprozess mit allen Mitteln beschleunigen, um den Rückstand aufholen zu können. Oberflächlich betrachtet scheint es sehr einfach, in die Modernisierung unserer Industrie und die Entwicklung fortschrittlicherer Produktionsmethoden zu investieren. Die große Frage ist aber, wo unsere Prioritäten liegen sollten?"
BAD_decision_enact_free_enterprise: "Enact Free Enterprise"
BAD_decision_enact_free_enterprise_desc: "We will need to adjust our laws in order to attract investors, as we have too harsh laws currently, which hamper the development of our economy. Liberialising the market is one thing we could do, as it would make us more attractive for investors."
BAD_decision_establish_an_industrial_code: "Establish an Industrial Code"
BAD_decision_establish_an_industrial_code_desc: "By establishing an industrial code we can give our businesses legal certainty. Doing so will hinder them doing things we do not want them to do, but in the long term this will raise their innovativeness and make up for problems in the short term."
BAD_mission_establish_baden_lumber_industry: "Establish Baden Lumber Industry"
BAD_mission_establish_baden_lumber_industry_desc: "We need to make better use of our resources in order to industrialize our country faster. Our rich forest areas and the high-quality timber in our woods provide a good basis for promoting this process."
BAD_mission_establish_baden_mineral_industry: "Establish Baden Mineral Industry"
BAD_mission_establish_baden_mineral_industry_desc: "We need to make better use of our resources in order to industrialize our country more quickly. We still have some untapped veins of mineral resources that we could use to further the industrialization process."
BAD_decision_expand_mining_districts: "Expand Mining Districts"
BAD_decision_expand_mining_districts_desc: "We still have several untapped mineral deposits in our country. Some politicians do think that it is the best idea to expand existing mining destricts and opening up new mines will help our economy and attract new investors."
BAD_decision_support_textile_industry: "Support the Textile Industry"
BAD_decision_support_textile_industry_desc: "Baden has a rich history of proto-industrialized textile production. By investing into modern technology and expanding industrial capacities, the output of our textile industry could be greatly improved."
BAD_decision_railway_upgrade: "Railway Upgrade"
BAD_decision_railway_upgrade_desc: "Our railway network is not up to the task of supporting let alone encouraging a modern industry anymore. Upgrading and expanding it would not only fix this problem, it would also grant our industry important contracts and the possibility for trade expansion."

#Country Leader Descriptions
BAD_FREDERICK_I_LEADER_DESC: "First sitting in the Baden Estates Assembly as an appointed parliamentarian and then serving as regent for four years due to his brother's poor mental health, Friedrich I became Grand Duke of Baden in 1856 - though his reign did not officially begin until 1858 upon his brother's death.\n\nFriedrich holds rather liberal leanings, and has the will and ability to enact significant social and political reforms. Being a supporter of a constitutional monarchy and rather reluctant to go to war, perhaps Friedrich I can be a relatively benevolent monarch who improves the lives of his citizens in an age of increasing anti-monarchy sentiment."
BAD_FRANZ_VON_STENGEL_LEADER_DESC: "Coming from a family of civil servants, Franz von Stengel himself worked in public service as a legal intern, state councillor, and a member of the Baden Estates Assembly. Most recently he has acted as Baden’s pseudo-Prime Minister as the head of the Stengel Cabinet.\n\nA Catholic and a relative conservative in an otherwise liberalizing era for Baden, von Stengel may be able to enact basic, non-ideological reforms and laws with little trouble but will likely find significant opposition to his pro-Catholic Church agenda."
BAD_ANTON_VON_STABEL_LEADER_DESC: "Born in the immediate aftermath of the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Anton Stabel's childhood was marked by significant political and military turmoil. Stabel embarked on a wildly successful career of civil service as a government lawyer and later judge, rising up the ranks of the legal profession from a relatively young age. While working as a judicial assistant, public prosecutor, university rector (president) and lecturer, as well as High Court vice-chancellor, he became a legal expert who was highly renowned in his field.\n\nStabel accepted a position as President of the Ministry for the Interior and Justice in the wake of the 1848 revolutions, and despite calls for a heavy-handed, reactionary response to the revolutions, he was at the forefront of a successful push for progressive reforms and judicial modernization. After being elected to the short-lived Erfurt Parliament in 1850, Stabel was appointed vice president of the Landstände where he has remained until becoming the head of state of a new, more liberal Baden.\n\nNow, Stabel has the opportunity to completely reform Baden to have one of the most modern legal systems in the world, and to generally turn Baden into one of the most liberal countries in Europe. Hopefully war does not prevent him from finishing what he started..."
