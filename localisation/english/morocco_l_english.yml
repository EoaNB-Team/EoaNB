 MOR_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Morocco is navigating a turbulent era marked by internal and external pressures. The country struggles with political fragmentation, economic difficulties, and an outdated military structure. The ruling Alaouite dynasty faces challenges in maintaining authority, and the need for modernization is increasingly pressing.\n\nExternally, European powers, particularly France and Spain, are expanding their influence in North Africa, viewing Morocco's strategic Atlantic and Mediterranean coastline as a valuable prize. The threat of foreign intervention looms as European interests grow, putting Morocco's sovereignty at risk.\n\nAt this crossroads, Morocco's leadership must balance the push for reform with the preservation of its independence as the country grapples with the demands of modernization and the risk of colonial encroachment. How it navigates these pressures will be crucial in shaping its future trajectory."

 MOR_mothballed_navy_desc: "The navies of the Mahgreb were once the most feared out of all in the Mediterranean, but these times are long gone. Our navy is outdated and underequipped compared to those of the European nations which have taken an interest in our prosperous lands some years ago and are looking to carve it up for themselves.

 MOR_idea_tackle_the_financial_crisis: "Tackle the Financial Crisis"
 MOR_idea_tackle_the_financial_crisis_desc: "Though the consequences of our new policies will take a while before the begin to bear fruit they indeed are a necessary change to remove ourselves from previous administrations and dynasties that were more intrested in enriching their own rather than the country as a whole.

We have already descreased inflation dramaticly in our country and the purchasing power of our citizens has skyrocketed compered to just a few years prior. To add insult to injury to those shady politicians and bussinessmen our efforts to escape the seemingly never ending fiscal crisis were an unprecedended huge success removing us from our precarious situation completely. The second great step has been completed and we can finally breathe freely knowing that the security of our finances is better than ever and from the ashes of old now rises a new age of oppportunity and modernity in Morrocan history."

 MOR_idea_trans_saharan_wealth_desc: "Beyond the mountain ranges of Atlas and into the harshness of the Saharan dessert lies much wealth previously ignored or undiscovered.

 MOR_fiscal_crisis: "Financial Crisis"
 MOR_fiscal_crisis_desc: "A crisis long thought coming our goverment had previously failed to answer properly to calls for reform or take actions to control the situation.

 MOR_crackdown_counterfeiting: "Crackdown on Counterfeinting"
 MOR_crackdown_counterfeiting_desc: "At a time when pushing for reform and new ideas is a vital need for our continued existance making sure that the exploitative feudal and powerful old elite is kept in check.

 MOR_attempt_combat_inflation: "Attempt to Combat Inflation"
 MOR_attempt_combat_inflation_desc: "Reckless infation largely due to corruption and recent financial difficulties has been plauguing us for far too long.

 MOR_trans_saharan_wealth: "Trans-Saharan Wealth"

 MOR_export_luxury_goods: "Export Luxury Goods"
 MOR_export_luxury_goods_desc: "Africa has long been a hub of commercial trade between the riches of Asia and Europe.

 MOR_infrastructure_expansion_desc: "One vital step to kickstart the industrial age in our country is to connect and expand the infastructure of our country.

 MOR_connect_major_cities: "Connect Major Cities"

 MOR_reinvest_commerce: "Reinvest in Commerce"
 MOR_reinvest_commerce_desc: "One key factor that played a major role to previous expansion in infastructure and road networks was the predetermined increase in commerce and trade between the cities of the harsh inland desserts and the sea. Although some increase in interterritorial trade is bound to happen investing even further will boost bussiness as well as make use of our recent indeavors for what they are worth."
 MOR_roads_rural: "Develop Rural Roads"
 MOR_roads_rural_desc: "Previous investments have proven their importance to the the state by making travelling easier and the central goverment more connected and powerfull thus relying less to powerhungry local elites and semi fuedal lords. Yet the focus of these efforts were more towards large and important centers of trade or key cities across the country focusing less in the rural and many times harser countryside. Efforts should be made to connect all corners of the sultanare and give every single city or village good enough infastructure networks for cross communication between largely isolated settlements stuck in the past."
 MOR_ubl_railway_offer: "UBL Railway Offer"
 MOR_ubl_railway_offer_desc: "After so much progress and development took place in  a small nation that just some time ago was considered backwards and incompetent it was only natural for them to turn their eyes once again to us. Them as the Europeans seek to maximize profit and slowly yet surely take control of us. Yet now unlike the nations of Europe instead of guns and men they came in with an offer which they know it would be difficult for us to refuse. Perhabs it is wrong to view them as different they work for the same masters after all allas their offer stands.

But no after massive riots and the strugle of the Morrocan people our indipendence was restored and our coutry reunited after brutal oppresion and occupation. While we won and they retreated back to their puny colonies they had shown to had learned from their previous invasion and switched tactics. Instead of trying to divide or conquer us by force the their shady strategies have evolved to seemingly beneficial bussiness offers from companies which thay are the main benefactors. They have long since shown their true colors and trusting them now will only lead us to total economic domination if not even words. We §RREJECT§! their offer."
 MOR_begin_construction_railline: "Begin the Construction of the Rail Lines"
 MOR_begin_construction_railline_desc: "Even though countless times history has shown that these companies owned and backed by Europeans are not intrested in our best intrests with their only goal being monopoly and economic dominion over us we must sign a deal with the devil and accept their demands.

 MOR_keeping_pace: "Keeping Pace"
 MOR_keeping_pace_desc: "We are living in an age of technological and industrial revolution where new faster and more effecient technologies are being developed left right and center with those that embrace them having an edge in the global game of politics and international influence while those who don not have shown to stay behing and slowly get absorbed by much more powerful and industrialized countries.

 MOR_engineering_education_desc: "Many professions have sprung in the bring of this new age of reform and progress for the world yet one in particular has proven to be the backbone of the majority of the recent technological developents.

 MOR_import_ottoman_egyptian_knowledge: "Import Ottoman-Egyptian Knowledge"
 MOR_import_ottoman_egyptian_knowledge_desc: "The sick man of Europe as well as his previous vassal of Egypt seem to be our most trusted allies that seek cooperation with mutual benefits. Yet the Ottomans and Egyptians wile being on the periphery still are more advanced than the rest of the world and have adopted many European institutions. We have much to gain from the relationship of two powers similar to us and this diplomatic relation might lead to an alliance between the two out of the three powers of the Maghreb and even some potensial territorial gains as well as knowledge."
 MOR_build_steam_engine: "Build Steam Engines"
 MOR_build_steam_engine_desc: "With recently aquired knowledge from both the West and the East along with a more educated youth has given us plenty of opportunities for further development. With modern equipment and a team of engineers taught abroad with their only intention of helping the nation it has come time to finally kickstart our entry into the industrial era once and for all. We now no longer rely on the ever more unreliable European trade for machine parts and trains since an opening of our own factories will begin the domestic industry they so desperatly try to deny from us. This day marks a vital first step for the grand vision of the sultan of one day standing up to the Great powers and establishing our own shpere of influence as to protect the Maghreb and the Sahara from those ruthless imprerialist in London and Paris. We are a shining example and an upcoming regional player that is now more than ever starting to break the ropes of the colonizers and experience true economic and political independence. We must that long awaited freedom at all cost and ensure the continued prosperity of the Morrocan people.Long live Morroco."
 MOR_al_rudani_printing_machine: "The ar-Rudani Printing Machine"

The printing press has proven to be a vital asset in any goverment and the massive spread of information that it produces is now more important than ever. After a short trip to Egypt he has come back from the Sous region along with a printing machine and someone to operate it. From now on we enter a new age of information that we hope could revolutionize education."

 MOR_economic_revitalization_desc: "After countless sessions and meeting of the sultan with his vassals and his personal court of advisors it has been decided that the revitalization of the economy is a matter of upmost importance and the nessecary steps to ensure a stable and growing economy ought to be taken at all costs."

 MOR_new_agricultural_techniques_desc: "For centuries the same semi feudal and some times even nomadic ways of our people has remained unhinged to the passage of time. Yet although the persistance of our people is admirable we must recognise the change in times and start to move along a newer and perhabs better direction. Just as we thought we had enough new problems arise and with them new solutions need to be undertaken. The argicultural sector has sadly been one of the most stagnant institutions of our country and reforms had not implimented until the Europeans arrived. Yet we have seen what overeliance on the imperialist powers brings and thus we will work on our own unique path towards a brighter future. Reforms based on previous European inventions will be taken but we will not allow anyone to take even an inch of farming land of a Morrocan citizen."
 MOR_invest_unused_land: "Invest in Unused Lands"
 MOR_invest_unused_land_desc: "As a nation at the edge of the Sahara and with harsh enviromental disasters being common our people since ancient times have concetrated in more hospitable regions leaving the Atlas mountains and the dessert terrain mostly empty. But with new advancements in technology as time progressed our people slowly began to migrate inland and inland as time moved on. Yet after centuries of gradual immigration inwards there still are areas very sparsly populated or unihabited. With new technologies better communication and faster as well as easier travel we can take advantage of all the lands that have been given to us and start a second gradual phase of investment and immigration further in."
 MOR_european_cotton_plantations: "European Cotton Plantations"
 MOR_european_cotton_plantations_desc: "As an ex-colony ourselves we have remained unhinged about our attitude towards Europe. But there is no doubt that the industrial powers despite our efforts towards slow technological progress still have a better quality and quantity of products such as cotton which we so much need. Despite the reason for these developments being clearly colonization and imperialism of other peoples just like us our cotton farms are inferior in quality to those in Europe or their colonies. Turning a blind eye this time and trading with them is ultimatly the best move as our soils are not suited for these kinds of crops and a shortage in cotton will put our economy and people in a lot of harships."
