 MEC_victory_against_the_reform: "Victory Against the Reform"
 MEC_victory_against_the_reform_desc: "After years of fighting our long and grueling civil war to ensure that the clergy, the military and our supporters would maintain power, we have been able to stop the radical reforms that have been destabilizing our nation and it's social order. Under the guidance of Miramón, the civil war was a success for the conservative party. Let us celebrate this great achievement."
 MEC_reorganizing_the_nation: "Reorganizing the Nation"
 MEC_reorganizing_the_nation_desc: "The nation is still in chaos and division after the civil war ended. Some of our states in the federal republic are still under the process of reintegration, so we should focus our efforts in assisting them, eliminating all liberal resistance and healing the scars of the civil war as we choose the next path for our nation and reorganize it properly."
 MEC_who_should_rule_us: "Who Shall Rule Us?"
 MEC_who_should_rule_us_desc: "As our nation enters a new dawn, away from liberal rule, a question poses a threat to our stability. Who shall rule us? Even if Miramón has won us the war against the Reform, his way of governing does not appeal to the elites and the clergy. The parliament should meet without the participation of our president, so we can decide on a new ruler."
 MEC_los_teocratas: "Los Teocratas"
 MEC_los_teocratas_desc: "The Theocrats have taken over our nation after the clergy allied itself with powerful minister and they have officially removed Miramón from power, leaving him merely as a general. Some of the most moderate factions have protested this as a dictatorial move, but the elite and the army have clearly sided with the priests."
 MEC_only_those_chosen_by_god: "Only Those Chosen By God.."
 MEC_only_those_chosen_by_god_desc: "We have to popularize the idea that only the fundamental representatives of the divine rule shall have power under Mexico. The people shall respect and support the figureheads of the church and what they represent."
 MEC_may_rule: "May Rule.."
 MEC_may_rule_desc: "The first step to ensure our position in the government of Mexico is to stop the process of elections, as they allow the people to be manipulated and tricked into voting for those who are not in any way, fit to rule our catholic nation."
 MEC_and_legislate_mexico: "..And Legislate Mexico."
 MEC_and_legislate_mexico_desc: "The Theocrats need to ensure that only the law of the Holy Bible shall control this land, no unholy constitution should be above it. The so said set of laws are nothing when put in comparison with the law of god. It is time to end it."
 MEC_the_church_is_the_state: "The Church Is The State"
 MEC_the_church_is_the_state_desc: "This system of presidentialism will end once the people realize that the Church and the State are now one. But, we need to act on behalf of the people to end it and bring all power to our great Archbishop. No second or third power shall oppose his divine rule over Mexico."
 MEC_weaken_the_unholy_opposition: "Weaken The Unholy Opposition"
 MEC_weaken_the_unholy_opposition_desc: "The liberals that have fought the civil war to reform the system and also brought many laws that weakened the church, are the greatest opposition to our government that has divine right over any of their claims and complaints. We should use the power of the church to weaken them and diminish their influence over our nation."
 MEC_legitimize_our_government: "Legitimize Our Government"
 MEC_legitimize_our_government_desc: "Our government needs to be considered legitimate by Rome and the Papal States, then the conservative catholics will be forced to comply and accept this new government. We will send a diplomatic envoy to the Pope and with that, our Archbishopric will rise."
 MEC_Army_of_God: "Army of God"
 MEC_Army_of_God_desc: "Our army must be modeled under catholic principles and be trained under them. We should let the experienced catholic generals of our army have more power to discipline the soldiers in a way that they can be more useful in battle, fighting in the name of the lord."
 MEC_los_cristeros: "Los Cristeros"
 MEC_los_cristeros_desc: "The Catholics of our nation have been thinking of creating a volunteer group of fervorous christians who will die in the name of God and join our army to fill the gaps in manpower. They will be the first in line to take the bullets and swords to protect the Archbishop and the church, fighting until the bitter end against the forces of heresy."
 MEC_learn_from_papal_war_doctrines: "Learn from Papal War Doctrines"
 MEC_learn_from_papal_war_doctrines_desc: "We can learn new tactics for our army using the brilliant plans from the military academy of Rome. New doctrines of war will be implemented and organized into our christian army, following the core principles of the church and adapting Italian warfare to Mexican warfare. We hope this bolsters our capacity to defend the Archbishopric."
 MEC_settle_the_debt_issue: "Settle the Debt Issue"
 MEC_settle_the_debt_issue_desc: "A spectre is haunting Mexico. The spectre of the debt. It's threatening nature might be the doom of our catholic project as a whole, as the European powers threaten to take immediate action against us. France and Spain are fellow catholics, so they should be diplomatically reachable. The Church needs to find an agreement, since we do not have the resources to pay the debt."
 MEC_long_live_the_new_emperor: "Long Live the New Emperor!"
 MEC_long_live_the_new_emperor_desc: "A solution has been found. Mexico will now be under French jurisdiction and with an Austrian emperor, with the church maintaining their influence and positions of power within the government. This is the only way that we are not invaded, giving away some of our duties to the French will also help stabilize the nation. But let's hope Maximilian does not break his promises."
 MEC_los_moderados: "Los Moderados"
 MEC_los_moderados_desc: "Our nation shall be ruled by the moderate Manuel Robles Pezuela, who will do his best to stabilize our economy and our politics, building friendly relations with the opposition and the foreign nations."
 MEC_agreements_with_the_liberals: "Agreements with the Liberals"
 MEC_agreements_with_the_liberals_desc: "We need to settle and re-institute the liberal party. A democratic nation can only be stable with an opposition, however, we need to deradicalize them from Benito Juaréz's extremism, returning the party to the hands of Comonfort, who after the loss in the civil war, is a more moderate choice. We need to reconstruct a friendly relation."
 MEC_deslaverize_our_nation: "Deslaverize Our Nation"
 MEC_deslaverize_our_nation_desc: "After the civil war, the reforms that the liberals established to secure the freedom of native and afro-mexican slaves were ignored, allowing for slave owners to exploit loopholes in our constitution. We shall work out a deal with the liberals to bring back their laws to combat slavery, improving life for the lower classes of Mexican society somewhat."
 MEC_restoring_our_democracy: "Restoring Our Democracy"
 MEC_restoring_our_democracy_desc: "The only way our republic can continue is if we return our elections and suffrage. Normal election periods will begin as soon as the parliament agrees on the new laws. We shall secure our stability."
 MEC_popularize_our_government: "Popularize Our Government"
 MEC_popularize_our_government_desc: "We need to use the news for government propaganda, spreading the success of the conservatives throughout all of Mexico. Our morals and values shall enlighten the Mexican people, making them prefer our form of government instead."
 MEC_weaken_church_influence: "Weaken Church Influence"
 MEC_weaken_church_influence_desc: "The Church and their priests are weakening our democracy. Although they were an important ally in the civil war, their intervention has gone too far. We need to try to slowly diminish their power over the Mexican nation."
 MEC_reinstitute_clerical_property: "Re-institute Clerical Property"
 MEC_reinstitute_clerical_property_desc: "The clergy cannot feel threatened by our government meddling in their affairs, so we need to take their bread but give them wheat.

 MEC_reaching_outwards: "Reaching Outwards"
 MEC_reaching_outwards_desc: "This government should concentrate some of their funds into diplomacy. We need to find powerful allies to secure our nation's image and improve our reach in international relations."
 MEC_befriending_our_northern_neighbor: "Befriending Our Northern Neighbor"
 MEC_befriending_our_northern_neighbor_desc: "The United States has been a rival since they won against us in the Mexican-American war, but this is not the time for petty disputes. We need to reapproach them and begin to diplomatically approach their government."
 MEC_send_mexican_volunteers: "Send Mexican Volunteers"
 MEC_send_mexican_volunteers_desc: "Sending some men to help the Americans in their civil war would be optimal to improve the conditions of our alliance. We need to help the Americans in uniting their nation and continuing being a great ally and partner for now, at least. If in the future, we change our mind, we'll recall the volunteers."
 MEC_negotiating_our_debt: "Negotiating Our Debt"
 MEC_negotiating_our_debt_desc: "Our debt with France, Spain and Britain is an immense problem. Our ministers in charge of our economy will try to negotiate terms that will be favorable to both parties, not putting us or them in disadvantage. There needs to be no violence in this deal."
 MEC_a_free_empire: "A Free Empire"
 MEC_a_free_empire_desc: "We have decided that we will partially pay the debt that the French established, but allying the European powers in the process by accepting Maximilian as our emperor. However, we will still act under Mexican jurisdiction, with Maximilian and his court having some power, but not absolute power, we will negotiate and find ways to properly govern this new, free and Mexican empire."
 MEC_los_autocratas: "Los Autocratas"
 MEC_los_autocratas_desc: "Our country should be ruled by the autocracy of Miramón and his army! Traitors have tried to destabilize our nation and take down Miramón, but they will not succeed. It's time to take drastic measures, establishing a new radical government that will be loyal to our Presidente! We shall disband the meeting that tried to replace him."
 MEC_weaken_the_moderate_elites: "Weaken The Moderate Elites"
 MEC_weaken_the_moderate_elites_desc: "The moderate conservatives are highly supported by the less radical elites, who do not want a nationalist state. We should bolster our efforts to combat their influence over Mexico, reducing the popularity of their conservative party and of their ideals."
 MEC_land_reform: "Land Reform"
 MEC_land_reform_desc: "A reform on the ownership of land is necessary for Mexico. The moderate elite controls the land and keeps it under the opposition's grip, this does not only weaken our government, but weakens the Mexican farmers. We need to reduce our inequality by forcing a reform by all means possible. The mexican workers shall support the government by supporting it by providing their agricultural products."
 MEC_unite_the_mexican_people: "Unite The Mexican People"
 MEC_unite_the_mexican_people_desc: "If the elites will not support us, then the people will, a strong, militaristic and united state will rise from the ashes of the civil war. We need to end slavery, to make sure that every citizen of every race supports our government above those nasty moderates! We shall rule them all!"
 MEC_disband_parliament: "Disband Parliament"
 MEC_disband_parliament_desc: "Our troops shall raid the state parliaments, as they seem to be suspiciously plotting against us, as reported by the local army.

They will not take us down."
 MEC_root_out_opposition: "Root Out Opposition"
 MEC_root_out_opposition_desc: "Every kind of opposition within our nation shall be diminished or eliminated. The liberals and the theocrats are still present in our cities, spreading their ideas and collaborating with what's left of the conservatives to coup us. This cannot be accepted, we shall weaken their grasp over our people by allowing only one-party elections and weakening the church."
 MEC_strengthen_the_army: "Strengthen The Army"
 MEC_strengthen_the_army_desc: "The Mexican Army must have all power and privileges to keep their current jobs. They are our ministers, our members of parliament and they are also tasked with defending our nation from outside and inside threats, such as the liberals and the conservatives. The army requires also new doctrines, to stay updated and powerful as ever."
 MEC_mexican_revanchism: "Mexican Revanchism"
 MEC_mexican_revanchism_desc: "The United States is our rival, not our ally. We need to remember our people of their past, of our defeat in the hands of the Americans in the war. Their image shall be the fire that burns for the war rage of the Mexican people!"
 MEC_befriend_the_southern_rebels: "Befriend The Southern Rebels"
 MEC_befriend_the_southern_rebels_desc: "The Confederate Rebels of the South may be future allies to our cause. They dislike the Americans and want to keep themselves independent and away from them, this is a respectable cause, so we shall recognize them diplomatically."
 MEC_send_rebel_volunteers: "Send Rebel Volunteers"
 MEC_send_rebel_volunteers_desc: "The rebels of the confederacy are not as powerful as the yankees of the North. We may need to send some of our troops to assist them in their cause, allying them with our nation and building an optimal relation for years to come."
 MEC_deal_with_french_imperialism: "Dealing with French Imperialism"
 MEC_deal_with_french_imperialism_desc: "The imperialist French and their allies, the British and the Spanish, want to use their debt as an excuse to invade and conquer our nation, threatening us to pay it or face consequences. We will tell them that we are ready for anything they try!"
 MEC_no_monarchs_in_mexico: "No Monarchs In Mexico!"
 MEC_no_monarchs_in_mexico_desc: "Those pesky europeans want to recolonize us by putting an emperor of all things on the throne! They should know better, the throne belongs to Miramón, our president and great leader! Their ships and men will be met with bullets from now on, as they are planning an invasion due to our aggressive response. Then, they shall face our great army!"
