 SRS_march_to_delhi_desc: "Delhi, The capital of the old Mughal Empire is currently undefended by any british troops and is ripe for the taking.As well as this the current Mughal Emperor holds the city and if we get him on our side, our cause will be greatly improved."
 SRS_pettion_to_bahadur_shad: "Send a Petition to Bahadur Shah"
 SRS_pettion_to_bahadur_shad_desc: "The Mughal Empire once held much of india in its grasp , although it is now relegated to a small successor state it still holds the respect of the common man. Its current emperor Bahadur Shah II still holds the capital of delhi and if we are to be successful we must gain his favour."
 SRS_holding_a_formal_court: "Holding a Formal Court"
 SRS_holding_a_formal_court_desc: "It has been a long time since Bahadur Shah has held court, now he has sided with our cause it is time for him to hold court once again."
 SRS_declaration_of_imperial_ambitions: "Declaration of Imperial Ambitions"
 SRS_declaration_of_imperial_ambitions_desc: "With our organization secured we should now reveal our ambitions in this war and in Hindustan in general. We strive to drive out the imperialist British and to restore the Mughal Empire with Bahadur Shah as our rightful leader!"
 SRS_fate_of_hindustan: "The Fate of Hindustan"
 SRS_fate_of_hindustan_desc: "With our victory in the conflict against the British the fate of Hindustan is now in our hands. We have managed the drive out the British from Northern India and reestablished the Mughal Empire. The Princes must decide - if they want to be on our side or against us."
 SRS_forging_military: "Forging a Military"
 SRS_forging_military_desc: "To be able to stand up to the British we need to unite the units fighting for our ambitions and establish a Mughal Army! A united and centralized army could fight better and more efficient against our foes!"
 SRS_finding_commanders: "Finding Commanders"
 SRS_finding_commanders_desc: "We have come across a problem within our armies. Our soldiers may be exceptionally trained but the Sepoy divisions will only follow the command of their Sepoy officers. Every attempt of us to establish some kind of high command in our new army has failed. We need to find some commanders that are respected by the entire army as fast as possible to quickly raise a high command!"
 SRS_commanders_in_field: "Commanders in the Field"
 SRS_commanders_in_field_desc: "Our commanders and the high command should be in the fields and near the front lines, so that they have the opportunity to quickly adapt to the current situation during the fights and experience firsthand, how the conditions are."
 SRS_command_from_palace: "Commanders in the Palace"
 SRS_command_from_palace_desc: "Instead of putting our high command at risk in a possible involvement in the battles, they should stay in the palace and put up the plans from there. Perhaps they could inform our Emperor about their plans and adaptations could be made by the officers during the fights."
 SRS_cohesion_force: "Force Cohesion within the Army"
 SRS_cohesion_force_desc: "If we want to achieve our goals, we ultimately have to work together as a unit, as good as we possibly can. Everyone, from the high command to the ordinary soldier, has to subordinate his own interests under the goal of restoring the Empire."
 SRS_dealing_relgion: "Dealing with the Religious Issue"
 SRS_dealing_relgion_desc: "Presenting us as the successor to the Mughal Empire will lead to us focusing more on our Muslim population, which means that the believers of the other religions may feel alienated. We have some options in hand to prevent this from happening."
 SRS_muslim_hindu_joint_state: "A State for Both Faiths"
 SRS_muslim_hindu_joint_state_desc: "Our second option would be to recognize both the Islamic and the Hindi religions as state religions, making both of them equal and showing both groups of believers that they have something to fight for."
 SRS_unting_the_two_halfs: "Uniting the Two Halves"
 SRS_unting_the_two_halfs_desc: "With both, Islam and Hinduism, being state religions and both of them having various supporters all over the Mughal Empire, perhaps we should try to unite both of the poles, both of the people and both of the religions? As unlikely as it may seem it could succeed, as shown by our unity during our rebellion."
 SRS_tolerance_given: "Tolerance Given"
 SRS_tolerance_given_desc: "We have managed to unite the people, which believe in Hindi and Islam and formed a community, where both of the believers can live independent and soon in peace. Whilst the other religions may not have the same treatment as Islam and Hinduism have, we will show them and their believers that we tolerate them, as well as Hinduism and Islam will be tolerated by all the communities in India."
 SRS_forging_a_military: "Rebuilding a Military"
 SRS_forging_a_military_desc: "Whilst we have managed to organize a army strong enough to beat the British, we still don't have a army that is strong enough to resist a full-scale invasion by another country. We need to reorganize our army once again and need to begin to modernize our weaponry to be able to strengthen our army. This will lead to us being able to withstand a invasion by Imperialists or even to become active ourselves and regain our former territories in Hindustan. We have no time to lose!"
 SRS_issue_of_obtaining_modern_equipment: "Issues of Obtaining Modern Equipment"
 SRS_issue_of_obtaining_modern_equipment_desc: "During the reign of Britain in India, the equipment used by the Sepoys were not the most modern. With the withdrawal of Britain the supply of newer equipment into our empire stopped. But if we want to have a strong army, we need to have modern equipment. We have two ways of dealing with this issue."
 SRS_foreign_designs: "Foreign Designs"
 SRS_foreign_designs_desc: "The first one would be to buy weapons from abroad. This could be the easier way to obtain new weapons, as they are already produced and we just need to buy them. But a downside to this would be that we would make ourselves dependent on foreign powers again - just after we obtained our independence. Is this a path we really want to persuade?"
 SRS_hindu_designs: "Hindu Designs"
 SRS_hindu_designs_desc: "Our second option would be to design and build these weapons ourselves. With that we could secure our own need for arms and stay independent in this industrial branch. But one of the problems if we want to go this way is that we are lacking a arms industry. So if we need to build those weapons, we have to invest into our industry. "
 SRS_lessons_from_the_war: "Lessons from the War"
 SRS_lessons_from_the_war_desc: "With the war against the British over, we need to analyze how we fought in this war and how successful our strategies were. We may be able to learn a thing or two and improve our army and strategies."
 SRS_retraining_sepoys: "Retraining Sepoys"
 SRS_retraining_sepoys_desc: "With our strategies and the war analyzed we have the opportunity to extend the training and retrain our Sepoys and by that, improve the standing of our army."
 SRS_standing_military: "Standing Military"
 SRS_standing_military_desc: "Whilst a army consisting just of Sepoys was enough to defeat the unprepared British troops in India, it certainly would not be enough to hold up a standing, organized army, like the European states have. If we want to survive, we will need to reorganize our Sepoy troops into a real standing army!"
 SRS_new_tatics: "New Tactics"
 SRS_new_tatics_desc: "What we also need to do is to think about new tactics we could use in future conflicts and wars to surprise our enemies. That could go as far as saving us from us being invaded again, no matter if we are being invaded by Europeans or regional powers in Asia."
 SRS_ideas_of_artillery: "Ideas of Artillery"
 SRS_ideas_of_artillery_desc: "War did get a new facet with the begin of the Industrial Revolution at the end of the last century, with the usage of industrially produced Artilleries. We could look into this new aspect of war and try to use it for our needs. Using Artillery we could invent new tactics that help us defend better and more effective with just Infantry units."
 SRS_professinalising_the_volunteers: "Professionalizing the Volunteers"
 SRS_professinalising_the_volunteers_desc: "During our last war, a lot of volunteers from all over India joined our cause, to defeat Britain and restore the Mughal Empire! Whilst using these volunteers helped us to defeat Britain and it's Indian holding, these volunteers don't have any warfare experience. If we want to incorporate them into our army, we need to give them a proper army education."
 SRS_national_reserves: "Found the National Reserves"
 SRS_national_reserves_desc: "With our volunteers having received a proper army education now, they can be incorporated in our army. But instead of incorporating them in our standing army outright, we could form a National Reserve, since having too many man in our army may be not effective, as there is no war approaching at the moment and we could need more men in our industry."
 SRS_a_professional_army: "A Professional army"
 SRS_a_professional_army_desc: "We have been modernizing our army for quite some time now. We have modernized our weapons and our training. We have retrained our Commanders and Sepoys with the experiences and analysis from the war against the British and established a national reverse that will help us as soldiers in situations of war and as civilians in time of peace. And with that, the process of modernizing our army is completed."

 ###East India Company/Raj###
 ###Dealing with Sepoy
 RAJ_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The English East India Company landed in the Indian city of Surat in 1608, establishing its first factory in 1613. Following the Battle of Plassey, the Company gained full control over Bengal. The entire Indian subcontinent would finally fall under the jurisdiction of the Union Jack in 1849 after the end of the Sikh Empire.\n\nIt has just been a year since Lord Canning was appointed as Governor-General of India following the departure of Lord Dalhousie. After rumours spread that the cartridges for the new Enfield rifle were tainted with pork and beef fat, several native soldiers initiated a mutiny against their British overlords. With internal discord and a nationwide mutiny at hand, it would seem that the Company's days are numbered."

 ###EVENTS###
 sepoy.1.t: "The Sepoy Mutiny"
 sepoy.1.d: "For the last century, the English East India Company has continued to consolidate their rule over the Indian Subcontinent. These once thriving and sovereign peoples of the Rajas have been overpowered one by one, subjugated and conscripted for a power two oceans away and turned into a suffering colony to be exploited and ridiculed.\n \nOur Sepoy soldiers serving the British Crown are treated at best like dogs. The land reforms and taxes of the East India Company have pushed millions to the brink of their livelihoods. Now, the latest insult to the people of India has brought revolt, a rumor that the cartridges needed for the newly introduced Enfield Rifle are lubricated with Pig and Cow Oils. India is Britain’s Crown Jewel but they dare treat our faiths and traditions with such blasphemy!\n \nTens of thousands of Sepoy Soldiers have now mutinied against the British Banner, offering a new hope for the people of India. The Indian people have been oppressed for too long. The time to take action is now and take back our fatherland!"
 sepoy.1.a: "Their injustices will be paid by blood."
 sepoy.2.t: "A call to arms!"
 sepoy.2.d: "Our brothers in Sepoy have asked us, as one of the states not yet under British occupation, to join in their revolt! Shall we join them in their effort to drive out the colonialists from India?"
 sepoy.2.a: "Yes, join their glorious rebellion!"
 sepoy.2.b: "No, we would just get crushed under the British boot."
 sepoy.3.t: "Civilian Assistance"
 sepoy.3.d: "The hearts of our citizens are set aflame by the revolt, it seems, and in a major effort, many of them have come together during the last few days to erect fortifications in the cities of Delhi and Lucknow! Although hastily assembled, these forts will make it harder for the Brits to take these provinces!"
 sepoy.3.a: "Great!"
 
 sepoy.6.t: "Threat to the North"
 sepoy.6.d: "After British influence collapsed in the North, the Sikh states have merged to form a Sikh empire which is has the capabilities to rival us. We must be cautious and build our strength to counter this new force in the region."
 sepoy.6.a: "Keep an Eye on them"
 sepoy.7.t: "Meet with the Princes"
 sepoy.7.d: "The Free Princes in the South of Oudh, Maratha and Hyderabad are the only states which are possible to join are newly formed Mughal Confedracy. However, while Hyderabad will be tricky to persuade to join us, the other two states will be easier as we all fought on the same side of the rebellion. We can spend great political capital to persaude them to willingly join as proper members or we can bribe them to join, although this may bring adverse effects and cause some issues in the long-term."
 sepoy.7.a: "Bribe the Princes"
 sepoy.7.b: "Persuade the Princes"
 sepoy.8.t: "Meet with the Prince of Hyderabad"
 sepoy.8.d: "While it was easier to persuade the other two states to join our cause, Hyderabad will be more difficult. It seems they distrust us as we fought on different sides of our war for freedom. As such, we will have to spend much more resources to persuade them to join our growing Confedracy or to save us this high price we can use force to make them join us. On the other hand, this will make us look bad and put us on-par with the British."
 sepoy.8.a: "Bribe the Prince"
 sepoy.8.b: "Persuade the Prince"
 sepoy.8.c: "Use Force"
 sepoy.9.t: "Mughal Empire Asks for Recognition"
 sepoy.9.d: "The old Sepoy Rebellion, now Mughal Empire requests for our international recognition and support. This is likely to safeguard them from any further invasions from the British, almost certainly wanting to re-take the "jewel in the crown". If we recognise this new empire, it will greatly anger the British but weaken their power in the region and maybe the globe."
 sepoy.9.a: "Support the Mughals"
 sepoy.9.b: "Stand by Britain"
 sepoy.10.t: "France Gives Recognition"
 sepoy.10.d: "France has came out and supported us on the international stage and has sent us much needed support. This will greatly wound the British."

 sepoy.17.a: "Great!"
 sepoy.18.t: "Mughal Empire Asks for Recognition"
 sepoy.18.d: "The old Sepoy Rebellion, now Mughal Empire requests for our international recognition and to give up on all of our claims to the region. If we don't do this, we would look like the bad guys on the world stage and there is no guarantee we can retake the country. If we do this, we'll lose our claim in India forever."
 sepoy.18.a: "Recognise the Mughals"
 sepoy.18.b: "The Empire Strikes Back!"

 sepoy.22.d: "Our neighbour has came out and supported us on the international stage. They have also has offered to send us support in the time of war, in return of their claimed territory. This will make our mission to unify India easier. We can accept their offer, however when the time comes we can choose not to call them to the war."
