 ### POLITICAL EVENTS ###
 JAP_imperial.1.t: "Deciding our Monetary System"
 JAP_imperial.1.d: "Under the leadership of the government, merchants introduced the kawase-kaisha, prototypes of western commercial banks. In 1871, Kiyonari Yoshida, a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official who has recently returned from a long stint in Europe and the United States, proposed a plan for the establishment of a single issuing bank modeled after the Bank of England. Saying the structure of the current Japanese economy stands similair to that of Britain. In 1871, the government declared that it would adopt the gold standard and introduce the yen as the new unit of account. Hirobumi Ito, a high-ranking official in the MOF, argued that if we introduce the U.S. system, we will be able to redeem half of the existing currency into banknotes and convert the other half into government bonds. His reasoning was based on the structure of the Japanese economy, which was decentralized at the time and more closely resembled the economy of the United States than the economies of Europe. Yoshida argued that we should introduce the common method of banknote issuance in Europe by establishing an issuing company with specie reserves. A sharp debate arose over the two competing plans for the new issuing bank system.' In his argument, Ito argued that 'if we introduce the U.S. system, we will be able to redeem half of the existing currency into banknotes issued by the newly established issuing companies and convert the other half into government bonds.' In doing so, he argued, 'we will recover the credibility of the currency.' Yoshida responded, 'We should introduce the common method of banknote issuance in Europe by establishing an issuing company with specie reserves. By doing so, we will eventually be able to make coins and paper money convertible.'\nWhat shall it be?"

 JAP_imperial.2.d: "Along with the de jure provinces, the Han, or Bakufu-han, served as a system of de facto administrative divisions in Japan. This system, which has been in place on these isles since the beginning of the reign of the Shogun nearly 265 years ago, has been nothing but bastardly corruption and ineffective results. This was the way of feudalism and the old, but the new imperial polity promised a new change—an effective change."

 JAP_imperial.3.t: "The Iwakura Mission"
 JAP_imperial.3.d: "Mission Iwakura will be a Japanese diplomatic expedition across the world between 1871 and 1873, with stops scheduled in the United States and Europe. It will be led by leading and voluntary Meiji era statesmen and intellectuals. Many prior Shogunate missions, such as the Japanese Embassy to the United States in 1860, the First Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1862, and the Second Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1863, preceded the Iwakura mission.\n \nThe mission's three objectives are to seek recognition for Emperor Meiji's newly restored imperial dynasty, to begin preliminary renegotiation of unequal treaties with leading international countries, and to conduct a complete study of modern economic, political, military affairs, and educational systems and structures in the United States and Europe."

 JAP_imperial.4.a: "An Expedition to Foreign Lands"
 JAP_imperial.5.t: "Imperial Japan"
 JAP_imperial.5.d: "Chapter I: Our History.\n \nFor two thousand years, House Yamato has reigned as the Emperors of Japan and its dominions, creating peace and prosperity under their rule. Our divine rule was given to us by Jinmu-tennō, or Emperor Jimmu, the son of Ugayafukiaezu and Konohana-Sakuya-hime, daughter of the dragon god, Ryjin. He is considered to be a direct descendant of Amaterasu, the noble goddess of the sun. Jimmu's narrative is linked to the stories of the Ōtomo clan, and its purpose of establishing clan ties to the royal line. With the help of local leader Sao Netsuhiko and Jimmu's older brother, Itsuse no Mikoto, they headed eastward via the Seto Inland Sea. According to the Kojiki, Jimmu died at the age of 126, and his posthumous moniker signifies divine power.\n \nChapter II: The Shōguns Dwindling Control.\n \nBut, ever since our rule was thwarted and usurped by the first Tokugawa ruler, Shōgun Ieyasu, the House of Yamato has been kept in silence and withheld all power. For more than 200 years, Japan has been kept in withdrawal from the outside world, but the tides have turned. Edo's shores were dotted with Western gunboats that had appeared on the shores of Edo, demanding the end of our isolation or facing utter consequences. This had broken the already collapsing Tokugawa control, and it was deemed time for a planned and well-ordered restoration, the Restoration of the Emperor Meiji:\n \nChapter III: The Restoration of the Emperor.\n \nThe collapse of Japan's Tokugawa shogunate and the restoration of direct imperial power marked the start of the Meiji Restoration. The shogunate's isolationist strategy was challenged in the nineteenth century by Russia, Britain, and the United States, making Japanese feudal elites aware of Japan's susceptibility to superior Western weaponry. Following Commodore Matthew Perry's visit, Japan was obliged to sign a series of unequal treaties that, like China, granted Western powers unique advantages in Japan. Young samurai from feudal lands that had been traditionally antagonistic to the Tokugawa system rose up against the government in retaliation. They declared the Emperor's return to power in January 1868, and the final Tokugawa soldiers surrendered in May 1869, after much intense battle. The revolutionaries have urged the Emperor to issue the Charter Oath, which promises a break between the feudal class restrictions of the past and a search for knowledge that could transform Japan into a modernized, thriving country, featuring a bolstering economy and a Western army. The restoration ushered in the Meiji period, a time of rapid modernization and Westernization."
 JAP_imperial.5.a: "A New Sun Rises in the East"
 JAP_imperial.6.t: "The Question of the Han System"
 JAP_imperial.6.d: "For hundreds of years, the Han System has allowed smaller, more autonomous daimyō to exist within the main government. At the start of the new Meiji Era, we must centralize and unify Japan. Or at least, that is what the central government is saying, but how will the rest of Japan react to the most drastic change Japan has seen in years?"
 JAP_imperial.6.a: "Where will this lead us all..."
 JAP_imperial.7.t: "The Osaka Conference"
 JAP_imperial.7.d1: "\tAfter being pressured by political liberals to adopt a more constitutional form of government, we have decided on a new provisional form of government. From now on the Judicial system will be its own branch of the government and called the Great Court of Cassation (Daishin-in).\n\n\tIn regards to what form a provisional legislature will take we have two choice. Both feature a bicameral system, where the Assembly of Prefectural Governors will serve as the lower house and the Senate (Genroin) will serve as the upper house. However the real difference is how the legislators are selected. The conservatives among us want only those loyal to the Emperor and his goals to serve him and his people, and the only way to ensure that is have all of them be appointed by the Emperor himself from among the most trusted officials and bureaucrats, rather than leaving it to a risky election determined by a mostly illiterate electorate. The rather bothersome liberals want, of course, said election. How are we to proceed?"
 JAP_imperial.7.d2: "\tAfter being pressured by political liberals to adopt a more constitutional form of government, we have decided on a new provisional form of government.

Both feature a bicameral system, where the Assembly of Prefectural Governors will serve as the lower house and the Senate (Genroin) will serve as the upper house. However the real difference is how the legislators are selected. Due to our mild political reforms allowing for some autonomy in the domains, we can expect each Daimyo to have different ideas how their representatives to this new legislature are selected, and it is expected that many will allow some form of voting, as a concession to the recently disempowered samurai class if nothing else. On the other hand it could be said that allowing the Daimyos to dictate to us how our power should be used is one step too far back to the days of the Shogun and even the Sengoku Jidai! How are we to proceed?"

Prefectures themselves are administrative jurisdictions traditionally governed by an appointed prefect, with these borders determined by the central government.

The expedition is led by a formidable force of over 3,000 soldiers, who are tasked with the mission of surveying the island's topography and establishing a foothold for Japan. The decision to send this expedition was made in response to several incidents involving Taiwanese aboriginals attacking Japanese fishing vessels, and also as part of Japan's larger strategy of expanding its influence in East Asia. As the expedition sets sail towards Formosa, there is a sense of excitement and anticipation among the Japanese troops, who are eager to showcase their strength and prowess. However, there are also concerns about the challenges that lie ahead, including potential resistance from the indigenous peoples of Formosa and the unpredictable nature of the island's terrain and climate.

 JAP_imperial.29.a: "We accept this victory as our triumph"
 JAP_imperial.30.t: "Chinese Delegations Refuse to Pay"
 JAP_imperial.30.d: "China's steadfast refusal to pay reparations for the Ryukyan Incident of 1871 is a deeply disappointing and frustrating stance. The incident, marked by the brutal attack on a Japanese diplomatic mission and the subsequent loss of valuable lives, was a grave violation of international norms. Japan had hoped that China would take responsibility for the actions of its citizens and provide reparations as a sign of remorse and commitment to maintaining peaceful relations. China's refusal not only perpetuates the sense of injustice felt by Japan but also hampers the process of reconciliation and trust-building between the two nations. Japan firmly believes that accepting responsibility and paying reparations would pave the way for healing, understanding, and a more stable future relationship between the two countries."

 JAP_imperial.31.t: "The Emperors Refusal"
 JAP_imperial.31.d: "The emperor's refusal to pay reparations is a deeply disheartening and perplexing decision. The incident, whether it be the Mudan Incident or the Ryukyan Incident, resulted in significant loss of life and damage to Japan. The demand for reparations is not driven by a desire for vengeance, but rather a pursuit of justice and acknowledgment of the suffering endured. The Emperor's refusal to pay reparations undermines the principles of accountability and fairness, casting doubt on their commitment to maintaining amicable relations. Japan had hoped for a resolution that would bring closure and promote healing, but the emperor's stance prolongs the pain and disappointment felt by the Japanese people, leaving the path towards genuine reconciliation uncertain and fraught with tension."

JAP_imperial.11.d: "Like the Imperial Army Staff took over the Army Ministry, the Navy General Staff took over operational, as opposed to administrative authority, which was left to the Navy Ministry, over the Imperial Japanese Navy from the Navy Ministry. It is to be responsible for the planning and execution of national defense strategy throughout our home islands and overseas territories. Through the Imperial General Headquarters, an overarching body under the supervision of the emperor designed to oversee the naval and army staff offices, it will report directly to the Emperor. It will always be headed by an active admiral headquartered in Tokyo.\n \n "The ministry is responsible for the naval budget, ship construction, weapons procurement, personnel, relations with the Diet and the cabinet, and broad matters of naval policy. The General Staff directs the operations of the fleet and the preparation of war plans.""
JAP_imperial.11.a: "Glory to the Imperial Navy!"
JAP_imperial.12.t: "Imperial Japanese Army Staff Office"
JAP_imperial.12.d: "The Army Ministry was created, along with the Navy Ministry, with the dutiful purpose of replacing the Ministry of Military Affairs (Hybush) of the early Meiji government. Initially, the Army Ministry was in charge of both administrative and operational command of the Imperial Japanese Army. However, with new arrangements being forced through the government, the Imperial Army General Staff Office will be taking over all operational control of the army, leaving the Army Ministry only with administrative functions.\n \nThe Imperial Army General Staff will thus be responsible for the preparation of war plans; the military training and employment of combined arms; military intelligence; the direction of troop maneuvers and troop deployments; and the compilation of field service military regulations, military histories, and cartography.\n \nThe Chief of the Army General Staff will be the senior ranking uniformed officer in the Imperial Japanese Army and will enjoy, along with the War Minister, the Navy Minister, and the Chief of the Navy General Staff, direct access to the Emperor—a privilege not many positions can claim to hold. In wartime, the Imperial Army General Staff forms part of the army section of the Imperial General Headquarters, an ad hoc body under the supervision of the emperor created to assist in coordinating the overall command of both the Imperial Army General Staff and the Imperial Navy General Staff."

There are riots in major cities: Schools teaching the western model are being burned; Government tax buildings, police stations, and factories are all included! We believe this has started because the French conscription law we copied word for word was translated by an incompetent who didn't understand that "Impot du Sang" (Tax of the Blood) wasn't an actual taking of people's blood. Regardless of the causes, instability has brought to the surface every resentment felt by all your subjects. Samurai who have lost their prestige, artisans who have lost their craft, and peasants who have lost their land can no longer claim to be superior to outcasts. Especially enraging was the provision that certain individuals could donate money to the armed forces specifically to shirk their duty. If we don't get a handle on this unrest soon, all that we've worked for these past several years could be lost!"

### INDUSTRIALIZATION DECISIONS ###
JAP_industrialization_category: "The Japanese Industrial Revolution"
JAP_industrialization_category_desc: ""As with France, an important consequence of the British Industrial Revolution for China and Japan was military vulnerability. China was humbled by British sea power during the First Opium War, between 1839 and 1842, and the same threat became all too real for the Japanese as U.S. warships, led by Commodore Matthew Perry, pulled into Edo Bay in 1853. The reality that economic backwardness created military backwardness was part of the impetus behind Shimazu Nariakira's plan to overthrow the shogunate and put in motion the changes that eventually led to the Meiji Restoration. The leaders of the Satsuma domain realized that economic growth—perhaps even Japanese survival—could be achieved only by institutional reforms, but the shogun opposed this because his power was tied to the existing set of institutions. To exact reforms, the shogun had to be overthrown, and he was. The Japanese built their own armament industry. As a consequence of these initial differences, each country responded differently to the challenges of the nineteenth century, with Japan diverging dramatically in the face of the critical juncture created by the Industrial Revolution.""
JAP_industrialization_mission: "Meiji Industrial Revolution Phase I"
JAP_industrialization_mission_desc: "The Meiji Industrial Revolution runs through its first phase: the Civilian Industry. The working people of Japan will thrive under the economic and safety changes made in the factories and workforce. Along with departments to handle public works, the introduction of electricity and a two-grid system will greatly benefit Japanese workers."
JAP_industrialization_mission2: "Meiji Industrial Revolution Phase II"
JAP_industrialization_mission2_desc: "The Meiji Industrial Revolution runs through its second phase: the Military Industry. The factories of Japan are run only by the sweat and blood of our people, who work around the clock to construct the army's weapons and armor needed for our growing ambitions. From arsenals in Osaka to machinefactories in Kagoshima, the military industry will know no bounds."
JAP_industrialization_mission3: "Meiji Industrial Revolution Phase III"
JAP_industrialization_mission3_desc: "The Meiji Industrial Revolution runs through its third phase: the Naval Industry. The dry dockyards of Japan have been used for nothing more than fishing and expeditions for the past hundreds of years, with naval power being insignificant and disgracable. An island looking for conquest will need dockyards fit to rule the Pacific, and it will start small and expand to our biggest cities."
JAP_industrialization_mission4: "Meiji Industrial Revolution Phase IV"
JAP_industrialization_mission4_desc: "The Meiji Industrial Revolution runs through its fourth phase: the Transportation Industry. As the West pushed forward with modern transportation systems, we were left in the dust with our horse and buggy. Railraods are the future, and a railroaded nation that has the logistics to push troops to the frontlines swifter than the enemy is a nation that can conquer."

japindustrialrevolution.18.a: "Put Considerable Money Towards"
japindustrialrevolution.18.b: "Do Not Spend Money On What Doesn't Need It"
japindustrialrevolution.19.t: "The Battle of Shiroyama"
japindustrialrevolution.19.d: ""The last forty samurai seek to avenge their fallen as they make their final gambit, valiantly charging into combat despite the storm of gunfire that threatens to tear them to shreds. A glorious fight for a terrible cause—these fallen soldiers lay waste on the ground, slaughtered ruthlessly by our Gatling guns... Bushido no hinkaku, samurai no saigo no toride (Bushido dignified; the last stand of the Samurai)"\n \nAt Shiroyama hill, Daimyō Samurai Saigō Takamori made his final stand, a beautiful fight waged by the surviving 500 samurai soldiers, all of whom still committed fealty to their commander and code Bushido. Despite starting with roughly 20,000 samurai, Saigō had lost the majority of his soldiers and vital supplies in a succession of prior losses, most notably at Kumamoto Castle and Tabaruzaka Fields. Rikugun-gensui Yamagata Aritomo, an old friend and fellow revolutionary of Saigō during the Meiji Restoration, was his principal opponent. Yamagata gathered his men, numbering in the tens of thousands, to encircle Shiroyama hill with intricate earthworks, trenches, and barricades, ensuring that no samurai could leave and putting an end to the uprising. The Samurai spent their days in preparation for the Imperial soldiers' onslaught. They spent their time at camp singing songs, writing poetry, and playing games. Yamagata appealed to Saigō for unconditional surrender before their terrible deaths.\n \n"As the leader of young vigorous men of the nation and resisting a great and famous army through many fierce battles, your fame is already well enough known to the world. But now most of your brave generals are dead or injured, and your military power is daily growing weaker. It is already clear that at last your Satsuma army is unable to keep its spirit. I don't know what further things you can hope to achieve, except a hopeless defensive battle. If you, Saigõ, rather than lengthen the rest of your days a little, prefer to cause hundreds and thousands of dead and wounded from both armies, there is nothing that I, Aritomo, can say to you. I beg you to judge for yourself as you hold matters in the palm of your hand, and that you will save both armies from death and injury. Ah, you are a man famous and known in the world. About our national constitution, naturally it is not only Aritomo who knows what you really think. But the matter has been settled over many years of public debate. I, Aritomo, earnestly beg you as your old friend. Writing this my tears fall like rain, and I cannot express myself at all. Please sympathize with the sincerity of my pain.""
japindustrialrevolution.19.a: ""I'm sorry... my friend."
japindustrialrevolution.20.t: "The Story of Shiroyama"
japindustrialrevolution.20.d: "...Saigō, true to the code of Bushido, refused to lay down his katana and surrender. \n \nBefore this rebellion, Saigō would never have thought this would be his way out, as he was a simple teacher of the samurai arts. He was content with the fall of the shôgun and the restoration of the Emperor, fighting many battles for the great cause. The changing winds of Japan and the modernization of the country meant the abolition of the privileged social status of the samurai class and the undermining of their financial position. His students stirred up tension between the new westernized government and the samurai class, indirectly involving Saigō in these actions. These very rapid and prodigious changes to Japanese culture, language, dress, and society appeared to many samurai to be a betrayal of the jōi ("expel the barbarians") portion of the sonnō jōi. With all this forced onto the people of old tradition, tensions boiled and the Satsuma rebellion would begin. \n \n"As the new age begins, the way of the warrior comes to an end; as the new age begins, the ways of old must apprehend." \nAfter a search party found Saigō 's body and head, Yamagata Aritomo was alleged to have been left speechless and motionless, murmuring to himself as he looked wearily. \n \n"As Rikugun-gensui Yamagata Aritomo was delivered the head of Saigō  Takamori after learning of his death from Seppuku, the Imperial army marched among the fallen, troops presenting signs of peace for the murdered samurai into the afterlife. I could see the calm expression on his face as he looked down at his dead friend. Many of the troops remained silent as they watched with respect and dignity as he ordered the head to be washed while holding it in his arms and reciting a tranquil meditation to the fallen warrior.""
japindustrialrevolution.20.a: "Forget our past, we forget ourselves. A leaf that does not know it is a part of a tree."
japindustrialrevolution.21.t: "Currency Act of 1871"
japindustrialrevolution.21.d: "The Meiji administration formally introduced a new currency in The Currency Act of 1871, or Yen Act of 1871, and chose the term "yen," which means "round item," for our silver dollar currency. Like many other currencies around the world, the yen was essentially a dollar unit, and it, like other dollars, originated from Spanish eights. This new currency has come to replace the old Tokugawa Coinage System, which was bloated and heavily underweighted, unlike what the new system will entail."
japindustrialrevolution.21.a: "A Splendid Proposal"
japindustrialrevolution.22.t: "The Railway Nationalization Act"
japindustrialrevolution.22.d: "Tarō Katsura, Prime Minister and Director of the Meiji Imperial Diet, appears on the beautifully covered marble and concrete stairs of the Kokkai-gijid, or Imperial Diet Building, in Nagatach, Chiyoda, Tokyo. Long and tense sessions wear him down on a daily basis, and neither the House of Representatives nor the House of Councillors can agree on anything no matter the situation. \n \n"I sit and stand, walk and then pace, talk and then yell, but all of my efforts are for naught since they merely dispute small and indecisively. Few out of many acts have passed within months, a staggeringly low number compared to earlier years. I don't think I'll be able to calm this zoo, and I don't think I'll be able to get anything through this spring." The exhausted minister moans, his gaze falling on the now setting sun, its fiery orange light glooming over the horizon. \n \n... \n \n“Order! Order! Silence your tongues, and let great Shushō Katsura speak, withhold your insolence!” \n \nThe hall becomes silent as footsteps from other chambers echo effortlessly off the marble walls. Katsura is seated on a multi-tiered semicircular platform in front of a central rostrum that divides the chamber. Banners depicting the Hinomaru, or eastern rising sun, hang from the front of the room's ceilings. \n \n'I propose to this great hall… the basis for the Railway Nationalization Act. . .' \n \n... \n \nThe candlelight glistens on the rough wooden table, which was meticulously carved by only the best for the job. A tiny document sits in the center of the table, and a hand rests near it, grasping a thin, white feather pen dipped in a little cup of black ink solution. Before a name is signed below it, the hand raises the pen from the cup, the ink droplets indicating their way up the page, etching across the document in proper scripting."
japindustrialrevolution.22.a: "The Emperor has Given his Signature"
japindustrialrevolution.24.t: "Send for Edmund Morel"
japindustrialrevolution.24.d: "Civil Engineer Edmund Morel had been studying at the notable school of the Kings College in London, of where he received his degree.

japindustrialrevolution.42.d: "Since we were given a respectable but still limited budget, the Industrial Revolution has advanced favorably for us. Our deadlines are swiftly approaching as each day passes and the spending rises. We risk facing a tsunami of unrest that will only drain our finances if we fail to meet it. Thankfully, governmental funding has been raised to support the industralization operations, which is good news for the departments in charge of them. Bless be the government, and let it be used to further progress!"

### CHARACTERS
JAP_character_emperor_meiji_desc: "Prince Mutsuhito was born on November 3rd, 1852, in a small house on his maternal grandfather's property at the north end of the Gosho. In our time, birth is culturally believed to be a source of pollution, so the imperial prince was not born in the palace. Instead, it is common for members of the Imperial Family to be born near the pregnant woman's father's house. In the case of the titled young Prince Sachi, his mother, Nakayama Yoshiko, was the daughter of acting major counselor Nakayama Tadayasu and a concubine to Emperor Kōmei.\n \nDue to the imperial lifestyle being so obscured behind closed doors, his youthful personality is contested. Sometimes he was seen as healthy and strong, somewhat of a bully, and he was exceptionally talented at sumo. Others describe him as delicate and often ill. But at his age now, he has matured and grown and is considered a proper leader of the people.\n \nThe young prince was born into an era of great change in Japan. This change was symbolized dramatically in July 1853, when Commodore Matthew Perry and his "Black Ships" sailed into the harbor at Edo. Their smog piling high up, covering the horizon over the capital. For the first time in at least 250 years, the shogunate took the highly unusual step of consulting with the Imperial Court due to the crisis brought on by Perry's arrival. The talk of "unequal treaties," giving up tariff authority and the right to try foreigners in their own courts, spread throughout the country. After the shōguns' willingness to accept these treaties, Emperor Kōmei was so incensed that he threatened to abdicate—though even this action would have required the consent of the shōgun."

### STARTING IDEAS ###
JAP_zaibatsu: "The Zaibatsu"
JAP_zaibatsu_desc: "The Zaibatsu are a group of Japanese conglomerates and wealthy business families that control sweeping political and economic areas of the Empire, including the big banks. The big four being Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Yasuda, all of whom are titans among the economic companies of our nation. How we will deal with them remains lost in futurity, but they will no doubt play their part in the shaping of the future of Japan."
JAP_samurai_spirit_western_weapons: "Wakon Yōsai"
JAP_samurai_spirit_western_weapons_desc: "'Wakon yōsai' (Japanese spirit with Western learning) entails adopting Western arts while honoring and developing Japanese traditional spirituality. Deriving from the expression 'Wakon kansai,' which has been used throughout our history, meaning the Japanese spirit imbued with Chinese learning."
JAP_recovering_from_boshin_war: "Aftermath of the Boshin War"
JAP_recovering_from_boshin_war_desc: "The aftermath of the Boshin War has shed light on how the state of our standing army can withstand the notion of war: poorly. Our troops continue to be inexperienced in more modern stratagems; military schools lack proper teaching and educators; our logistical planning cannot withstand a drawn-out conflict; and political leaders are concerned about the army's performance. We may stand on the edge of utter destruction, but reforms promise rehabilitation."
JAP_riots_of_rights: "The Riots of Rights"
JAP_riots_of_rights_desc: "Riots against our new way of life and the rights of the people within it, dubbed collectively as the "Riots of Rights" by many, have erupted across our many prefectures, posing a significant challenge to the newly formed government; what will calm these meddling citizens?\nThe protests had started targeting symbols and agents of the Meiji reforms that were disrupting their previous way of life: vandalizing and raiding government offices, police stations, newly established public schools, and the homes of government officials and newly emancipated Burakumin. Our government is not a democracy and the Meiji oligarchs have made all decisions without any consultation with our general public, enraging farmers and low-ranking rural samurai, who felt that they had no outlet to air their grievances other than through violent protest."
