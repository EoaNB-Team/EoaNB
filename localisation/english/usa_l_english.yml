 ### EVENTS ###

 USA.1.t: "These United States"
 USA.1.d: "A republic birthed from revolution, these United States, and it's citizenry there within, have both gained and strive for the furtherance of their god-given inalienable rights and freedoms endowed upon them. Formerly under the rule of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, they declared their intention of independence from the tyranny of their mother country and their King, George III, on July 4th, 1776. The nation was in a bloody conflict prior to that formal declaration, finding ultimate success, with aid from both the Kingdoms of Spain and France, on September 3rd, 1783.\n\n Nearly a century since our country's founding, a lot has taken place. We have seen the Louisiana Purchase occur, gaining us a large portion of land from the French. War commenced once again with the British during the War of 1812. We've purchased Florida from Spain, were ceded Oregon from the British, and annexed the Republic of Texas. This last feat, however, brought us to war with the Mexican government, which helped aid in military reforms that ended with us earning victory and a large swathe of land from the Mexicans.\n\n With our territory spanning sea to sea, Americans can now fulfill both Manifest Destiny and their American Dream. It will not be easy for most families as braving the frontier is dangerous. Aside from natural issues, of which being the environment, disasters, and beasts of different sorts of manner, there are also numerous tribes of people some of which war with us and some of them aly and trade with us. Nevertheless, the American is a determined breed with great ingenuity and will see through the success of their goals."
 USA.1.a: "Please, continue."
 USA.1.b: "I am well read, thank you."
 USA.2.t: "The 1856 Election"
 USA.2.d: "It is obvious that the Democratic Party won the bid for Presidency, with their nominations of, then Minister to Great Britain and former Secretary of State, James Buchanan and former Representative, now Vice President, John C. Breckinridge. The Republican Party, formed two years prior, put up former Senator John C. Frémont as their Presidential Candidate and former Senator William L. Dayton as their Vice Presidential Candidate in their first run in a Presidential Election. The American Party, commonly referred as the “Know Nothings”, nominated former President Millard Fillmore for reelection as President and former Ambassador Andrew J. Donelson as their Vice Presidential Candidate.\n\n President Franklin Pierce hoped for renomination for the election, although the Democratic Party decided to go with a less controversial candidate, as Pierce signed the Kansas-Nebraska bill and the succeeding “Bleeding Kansas” conflict. Stephen A. Douglas, another possible candidate, withdrew his name from the race when Buchanan pledged not to seek reelection in the Election of 1860. With the matter of slavery being the primary focus of this election, Buchanan promised to not add nor detract from the official party platform which emphasized the non-intervention of slavery in the territories.\n\n The Republican Party's platform essentially stated that there should be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except for the punishment of crime, in any of the Territories of these United States. Their chant, due to their nominated candidate, was “Free Speech, Free Soil and Fremont.” The Democratic Parties strategy, as Bucahnan did not tour the country, instead residing in his home “Wheatland” performing political and campaign events for hundreds of visitors, was to represent the Republican Party as a bunch of radicals, as a party of disunity and described Fremont as a Catholic, a drunkard, a bastard, and an abolitionist who would destroy the union. Lastly, the American Party decided to base their platform not on the issue of slavery, but to focus on the concept of nativism, being anti-immigrant and anti-catholic, alongside the separation of Church and State."
 USA.2.a: "And then?"
 USA.2.b: "I recall these events."
 USA.3.t: "State of the Union"
 USA.3.d: "With the results in, it is confirmed that James Buchanan has secured the presidency. To prepare for his term in office, Buchanan traveled to Washington D.C. in late January and stayed at the National Hotel. Unfortunately, during his stay there and for the first three months of 1857, a bout of intestinal malady overfell residents of the hotel which was dubbed as the “National Hotel disease,” conspired to be an assassination attempt by radical abolitionists, but remained baseless rumors. Buchanan was impacted by the disease and forced to remain at his home in Lancaster with minimized visitors in the weeks before taking office.\n\n Both his trip to Washington D.C. and the day of his inauguration was a gigantic celebration, filled with parades and partying. Every resident of Washington D.C. scrambled to get the $5 entrance fee to his party. However, there was controversy within his speech that he was already aware of the decision regarding the ongoing Supreme Court case, Dred Scott v. Sandford, indicating that he might have been illegally informed.\n\n Afterwards, Buchanan would appoint his own cabinet, composed of members whose interests aligned with those of the southern states. Although he himself was a northerner who detested slavery, believed that it was not the government's role to abolish it. Thus brings him to deal with his current problem, chiefly the situation known as Bleeding Kansas. Aside from that, there are active conflicts in the state of Florida with the remnants of the Seminole tribe with the ongoing Third Seminole War."
 USA.3.a: "Thank you for catching me up."
 USA.4.t: "Our Intentions for the Utah Territory"
 USA.4.d: "Due to both popular and political pressure, President Buchanan made a pledge on March 4th, the same day as his inauguration, to replace the current Governor of the Utah Territory, Brigham Young, who holds high leadership in the Church of Latter Day Saints, with a more secular candidate who holds closer ties to the federal government.\n\n The urgency of the matter was when Judges William Wormer Drummond and George Philander Stiles resigned from their positions and claimed the people there were seditious, amplified by the letter of nullification sent by Governor Young, stating to no longer follow federal law. Buchanan has since written many letters to different individuals, hoping to find a suitable replacement, however, there has been no luck yet. No official notification has been sent to sitting Governor Brigham Young either."
 USA.4.a: "The search continues..."
 USA.5.t: "The Search Concludes"
 USA.5.d: "As we know from earlier in the year, President Buchanan has been on the look for a candidate to replace the Mormon Governor of the Utah Territory, Brigham Young. The news has come out that the search has now concluded with our new nomination being Alfred Cumming. He is set to travel out to the territory with his wife, Elizabeth Randall Cumming,  soon to take control of the Government in the Utah Territory, accompanied by an army of 2,500, that began organizing earlier in May, to act as peacekeepers to ensure the transfer of power goes well. To note some credentials of Cumming, he was mayor of Augusta, Georgia, a sutler to Zachary Taylor during the Mexican-American War, and negotiated with the Blackfeet Nation as the superintendent of the Central Superintendency."
 USA.5.a: "We hope things go well."
 USA.6.t: "Developments from the Expedition"
 USA.6.d: "On July 18th, a portion of the expedition embarked on their journey towards the Utah Territory. Composed of units of Infantry and Artillery from the 10th Infantry Regiment, albeit without calvary, they make their way under the leadership of Colonel Edmund Brooke Alexander. Another matter is that Colonel William Selby Harney sent out Captain Stewart Leonard Van Vliet, a member of this expedition who has had prior encounters with the Mormon peoples and garnered their trust, to embark alone with haste in order to see if they could sell supplies for their camp."
 USA.6.a: "Let's hope for good news."
 USA.7.t: "The Expedition Embarks on their Journey"
 USA.7.d: "The rest of the expedition has finished its preparations and Colonel Albert Sidney Johnson has been selected to relieve Colonel Harney from command. This was a long awaited change, as Colonel Harney was not able to leave with the expedition itself, and remained in Fort Leavenworth to deal with the matter of the Kansas Territory whilst handling the affairs of the expedition. He embarks out, alongside soon to be Governor Cumming and several other civilian officials with the aid of the 2nd Dragoons."
 USA.7.a: "We are on the move!"
 USA.8.t: "Van Vliet's Report"
 USA.8.d: "Today, Captain Van Vliet rendezvoused with Colonel Alexander's group to relay intel he gathered from meeting with the Mormon government in Salt Lake City. Supposedly the Mormon people seem prepared to defend their lands, and have burnt grass from past the South Pass, which they had just reached, on the way to Salt Lake City. They seemed more than eager to burn their homes and supplies to avoid it falling into the Expedition's hands. They seem eager to keep a harassment campaign, trying to disway the Expedition from continuing though the final call lies with Colonel Alexander's decision."
 USA.8.a: "We are limited on time. Onwards!"
 USA.8.b: "We shall camp at the nearby Fort Laramie and wait for the rest of the Expedition."

 ### CHARACTERS ###

l_english:
 USA_character_james_buchanan_desc: "James Buchanan, born in 1791 in a humble Pennsylvania log cabin, ascended from modest beginnings to become one of America's most seasoned statesmen, serving in the Pennsylvania legislature, U.S. House, Senate, as Minister to Russia under Jackson (negotiating commercial treaties), Secretary of State under Polk (key in Oregon settlement and Texas annexation, showcasing expansionist diplomacy), and Minister to the UK under Pierce (managing Crimean War tensions and supporting the Ostend Manifesto for Cuban acquisition to aid Southern interests). A lifelong bachelor, skilled lawyer, and eloquent pragmatist respected across parties, he was elected President in 1856 as a Democrat, defeating Frémont and Fillmore by promoting national unity and slavery non-interference, earning the 'doughface' label as a Northerner with Southern leanings. His policies stress limited federal authority, states' rights, and popular sovereignty—letting territories like Kansas vote on slavery—to ease sectional tensions, while his inaugural address optimistically anticipated the Dred Scott decision to resolve slavery via judiciary, and his balanced cabinet reflects compromise efforts. Characterized by caution, deliberation, and a conciliatory nature forged in public service, Buchanan prioritizes Union harmony and constitutional adherence over innovation, positioning himself as a bulwark against abolitionists and secessionists, though critics assail his indecisiveness and pro-Southern bias as potentially exacerbating divisions; by May 1857, post-Dred Scott (denying slaves citizenship and affirming them as property), he aims to enforce it for enduring peace."
 USA_character_samuel_black_desc: "Samuel W. Black, the 7th Governor of the Nebraska Territories, is a Democratic leaning politician with roots previously in the Pennsylvania political scene. Though a Nebraska Territories Governor currently, he spent much of his life and accolades within Pennsylvania. Whether it was time as a successful lawyer with an ability to redirect juries to his own visions or as a Lieutenant-Colonel of the Second Pennsylvania Volunteers during the Mexican–American War of which he acquitted himself with great distinction, much of his life’s success could be attributed to his time in the Midwestern State. Only after losing his running campaign as a Representative did he make his move to the Nebraska Territories where his current political career took shape rapidly, holding a United States Judge position in the 2nd Judicial District before rising to the position of Governor. From the streets of Pennsylvania and the Nebraska Territories to the fields of Mexico, Samuel W. Black is known especially for his impulsiveness, wit, courage, and chivalry, traits that accented his achievements in the courtrooms and on the battlefield."
 USA_characters_john_breckinridge_advisor_desc: "Vice President to James Buchanan, John Cabell Breckinridge is a member of the Democratic Party. On the ongoing issue of slavery, Breckinridge is torn from his morals and upholding the constitution. He believes that the institute of slavery is evil, yet still protects it due to slaves' status as property, and the constitution protects one's rights to their own property. He is also an advocate of manifest destiny. During the last election, he emphasized his belief that the Republican party would tear the nation apart."
 USA_character_roger_taney_desc: "The 5th Chief Justice, Roger Brooke Taney, was appointed by former Democratic President Andrew Jackson. He was widely respected and people believed he was going to settle the national debate over slavery. However, as we know from the recent Dred Scott case, it only bolstered the Republican party, garnering anger from north due to the decision. This ultimately could be because of his support of slavery."
 USA_character_lewis_cass_desc: "The 22nd Secretary of State, Lewis Cass, is a member of the Democratic Party. He is a veteran of the War of 1812, reaching the rank of brigadier general, and participating in the Battle of the Thames. Under President Andrew Jackson, he was appointed as Secretary of War and aided his policy of Indian Removal. In regards to the issues of slavery, he's an advocate for popular sovereignty."
 USA_character_howell_cobb_desc: "The 22nd Secretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb, is a member of the Democratic Party. He sided with former Democratic President Andrew Jackson on the question of nullification and was a passionate advocate for the extension of slavery but came around to support the Compromise of 1850."
 USA_character_john_floyd_desc: "The 24th Secretary of War, John Buchanan Floyd, is a member of the Democratic Party. He is pro-slavery and almost got in trouble, as governor of Virginia, when he recommended to the Virginia General Assembly to pass a law taxing imports from states refusing to return fugitive slaves owned by Virginian masters. This would have violated the Interstate Commerce Clause."
 USA_character_jeremiah_black_desc: "The 24th Attorney General, Jeremiah Sullivan Black, is a member of the Democratic Party. He gradually became one of the leading American lawyers, serving as a Chief Justice on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court."

 USA_character_winfield_scott_desc: "Winfield Scott, born June 13, 1786, near Petersburg, Virginia, is a towering military icon known as 'Old Fuss and Feathers' for his strict discipline, flamboyant style, and insistence on proper military decorum. Commissioned as a captain in 1808, he rose to prominence in the War of 1812 through heroic leadership at Queenston Heights, Fort George, Chippewa, and Lundy's Lane, enduring grave wounds while reforming army tactics via influential manuals. Scott commanded in the Black Hawk War (1832), Second Seminole War, and the contentious Cherokee removal (1838), but his pinnacle came as Commanding General since 1841 during the Mexican-American War, orchestrating the daring 1847 Veracruz landing and a masterful campaign defeating Mexican forces at Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec to seize Mexico City. Brevetted Lieutenant General in 1855—the highest rank since Washington—Scott exemplifies strategic brilliance, unyielding resolve, and a commanding presence that inspires awe and respect."
 USA_character_john_wool_desc: "John Ellis Wool, born February 20, 1784, in Newburgh, New York, of Dutch descent, overcame an orphaned childhood and early mercantile work to study law before enlisting as a captain in the 13th Infantry in April 1812 during the War of 1812, where he displayed extraordinary valor by leading a charge at Queenston Heights to seize enemy cannons despite severe thigh wounds, and later at Plattsburgh in 1814 with clever tactics using cover and artillery to thwart the British, earning brevets and promotions to major in the 6th Infantry by 1815. Appointed colonel and Inspector General in 1816, he observed European armies in 1832, managed the Cherokee removal in the 1830s by founding Fort Butler, and rose to brigadier general in 1841. His crowning feats occurred in the Mexican-American War, leading the Center Division on a arduous 900-mile march to take Saltillo, then bolstering General Zachary Taylor at Buena Vista in 1847 with pivotal command that clinched victory, meriting a Congressional sword, thanks, and brevet to major general. Subsequently heading the Department of the Pacific, he quelled the Rogue River Indian War by 1856 while safeguarding Native rights against militia overreach. Hailed as one of the Army's premier officers by the 1840s, Wool personifies meticulous organization, sharp tactical insight, and indomitable perseverance amid hardship."
 USA_character_david_twiggs_desc: "David Emanuel Twiggs, born February 14, 1790, in Richmond County, Georgia, son of Revolutionary War General John Twiggs, was raised on a plantation and studied law before joining as a captain in the 8th Infantry in March 1812 during the War of 1812, showcasing fierce courage with wounds at Frenchtown in 1813 while seizing British posts and aiding the defense of Fort Meigs. Advancing post-war to major (1825), lieutenant colonel (1831), and colonel of the 2nd Dragoons (1836), he led aggressive operations in the Second Seminole War against Native Americans. His greatest triumphs came in the Mexican-American War, promoted to brigadier general in 1846; serving under Zachary Taylor, he excelled with dragoons at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, then directed the brutal capture of Monterrey, earning a brevet to major general. Joining Winfield Scott, Twiggs led charges at Cerro Gordo—crushing Santa Anna—plus victories at Contreras, Churubusco, Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec, instrumental in taking Mexico City. By early 1857, commanding the Department of Texas, the robust, formidable Twiggs—dubbed 'The Bengal Tiger' for his fiery temper, rigorous discipline, and relentless fighting spirit—epitomizes daring command, bold strategy, and an uncompromising warrior ethos."
 USA_character_persifor_smith_desc: "Persifor Frazer Smith, born November 16, 1798, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Jonathan and Mary Ann (Frazer) Smith, graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton) in 1815, studied law, and moved to New Orleans in 1819 to build a successful legal career while holding elected offices and rising in the militia as adjutant general of Louisiana. His military distinction began in the Second Seminole War, elected colonel of Louisiana volunteers in 1836, leading notable campaigns until 1838 that impressed Generals Scott and Taylor, followed by commanding a Pennsylvania regiment. Commissioned colonel in the regular Army in May 1846 during the Mexican-American War, he led a brigade at Monterrey, earning a brevet to brigadier general for gallantry; joining Scott's army, he excelled in the Veracruz landings, Cerro Gordo rout, and especially Contreras—dubbed its 'hero'—plus Churubusco and assaults on Mexico City, meriting a brevet to major general, service on the armistice commission, and as military governor. He commanded the Pacific Division from 1848-1849, acting as California's military governor briefly and sending relief to Sierra Nevada emigrants; from 1850-1856, he led the Department of Texas, establishing frontier forts like Davis and Lancaster against Native threats; by 1856, heading the Department of the West from St. Louis, he dispatched forces to pacify Bleeding Kansas, culminating in his promotion to regular brigadier general on December 30, 1856. As of early 1857, the steadfast and proficient Smith—celebrated for his administrative skill, courageous battlefield command, and respect from top generals—represents tactical wisdom, firm discipline, and a compassionate edge that softens his stern leadership, establishing him as a highly adaptable and esteemed Army officer."
 USA_character_william_harney_desc: "William Selby Harney, born August 22, 1800, in Haysborough near Nashville, Tennessee, to Revolutionary War veteran Thomas Harney and Margaret Hudson as the youngest of eight, received a local education before a brief naval commission in 1817 led to his Army transfer as second lieutenant in the 1st Infantry on February 13, 1818, where he boldly combated piracy against Jean Lafitte in Louisiana, earning promotion to first lieutenant in 1819, and undertook frontier tasks like fort-building, recruitment, courts-martial, and Missouri River treaty missions in 1825 while aiding Andrew Jackson. Advanced to captain in 1825, he married Mary Mullanphy in 1833, fathered three children, and rose to major in paymaster corps in 1833, then lieutenant colonel of the 2nd Dragoons in 1836; his fierce Indian-fighting fame grew in the 1832 Black Hawk War alongside Zachary Taylor and Jefferson Davis, and especially the Second Seminole War (1835-1842), with daring raids at Loxahatchee (1838) and Caloosahatchee (1839), meriting a brevet to colonel in 1840. Promoted to full colonel of the 2nd Dragoons in 1846 during the Mexican-American War, Harney served under John E. Wool in Chihuahua and fought heroically at Buena Vista, then as senior cavalry officer in Winfield Scott's Veracruz siege; despite a reversed court-martial for insubordination at Monterrey—thanks to President Polk's intervention—he triumphed at Cerro Gordo (1847), routing Mexicans for a brevet to brigadier general, and shone at Contreras, Churubusco, and Mexico City assaults, though tainted by harsh treatment of San Patricio deserters, including prolonged hangings. Post-war, he commanded Texas's Military Department Number Five (1849-1853) against Native raids; in 1854-1855, he led the vengeful Sioux Expedition after the Grattan Massacre, inflicting heavy casualties at Ash Hollow on Brulé Lakota—including non-combatants—securing fragile peace by 1856 amid nicknames like 'The Butcher' and 'Woman Killer.'' After brief 1856 Seminole duties and quelling 1857-1858 Bleeding Kansas unrest, initially tapped but replaced for the Utah Expedition, Harney— a commanding 6-foot-3 presence with intense blue eyes—attained full brigadier general on June 14, 1858, at 57 the youngest among Army generals, personifying unbridled ferocity, strategic daring, and ambitious drive, offset by a hot temper, political astuteness, and a polarizing record of severity that fueled both acclaim and criticism as a dominant yet contentious leader."
