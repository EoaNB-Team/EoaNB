# Worker Events
 
 usa.279.t: "New England Shoemakers Cut Wages!"
 usa.279.d: "Shoemaker factories within the New England region have had to cut wage significantly during the economic panic! Many workers cite these wages are insufficient to live off of, but others say they can sustain it for a temporary time. Even so, many workers are content with simply having a job since many workers were fired during the economic panic."
 usa.279.a: "Well, temporary wage cuts are understandable during this panic..."
 
 usa.281.t: "The New England Mechanics Association"
 usa.281.d: "The Panic of 1857 resulted in the temporary loss of jobs for many shoemakers. Workers were also angry at the increasing mechanization of the shoemaking process, discontent with the feeling of being replaced. When companies began hiring again, the cost of shoes went up and wages declined significantly. Many workers cited this increased revenue was solely going to the owner's pockets at the detriment of the living conditions for workers. Working hours were long, about 16 hours per day, and wages were low; men were earning only $3 a week and women just $1.\n\nThus the Mechanics Association was organized to negotiate conditions with employers, and demanded pre-panic wages or better."
 usa.281.a: "This is an issue between the company and it's workers, not the government."
 usa.281.b: "Recognize them and give this organization support!"
 
 usa.282.t: "The New England Shoemaker Strike!"
 usa.282.d: "After a week of failed attempts of negotiation between factory employers and the New England Mechanics Association, And so they walked off the job on Washington's birthday because it was a 'fitting day for a blow in favor of the cause you engage in.'\n\nReporters covered the mass meeting at Lyceum Hall in Lynn, calling it the 'largest and most enthusiastic of its kind ever held in New England.'' The workers set up committees of 100 men each to post the names of scabs, to keep order and to make sure shoes wouldn't be finished elsewhere. They then marched to their factories and handed in their tools.\n\n'I am glad to see that a system of labor prevails in New England under which laborers can strike when they want to, where they are not obliged to labor whether you pay them or not,' wrote Abraham Lincoln. 'I like a system which lets a man quit when he wants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere.'"
 usa.282.a: "Oh."
 usa.282.a: "Let's hope that doesn't inspire strikes here..."
 
 usa.283.t: "The New England Shoemaker Strike Ends!"
 usa.283.d: "There was no rowdyism, and the strike leaders strongly discouraged alcohol. The strikers enjoyed community support, with businessmen contributing money and groceries and clergy denouncing the employers from their pulpits. When Boston police arrived at the train station, a crowd of 8,000 people jeered and hissed at them.\n\nThe employers were ready to raise wages by the second week of the shoemakers  strike, but refused to recognize the union. On April 10, a thousand Lynn workers went back on the job after 30 employers agreed to raise wages by 10 percent. Some held out for a few weeks longer, but the shoemakers strike had ended.\n\nThe women had already gone back to work. Though the men supported them, they didn't include the women's wage demands in their proposals. They were concerned the employers wouldn't consider their demands if they added the women's.\n\nSome employers did sign agreements with the local unions. Most of the male workers got a raise, and unions organized where previously they hadn't existed. As the Haverhill Gazette reported, “An Association of mechanics will grow out of the movement which will doubtless do much for the protection of the laborers in their rights.”"
 usa.283.a: "Well, at least it's over..."

Few would mind those funds from being nudged in the right direction, especially to move more people out west. To do so, we will subsidize the construction of a new railroad in Missouri and give an easier start for the pioneers venturing outbound from Independence."

 USA_paper_money_war: "Confiscate the 1s!"
 USA_paper_money_war_desc: "President Buchanan believed the root cause of the panic was the issuing of paper money and the substitution of 'hard' currency. He withdrew the usage of all dollar bills with nominal values under 20$ and pushed for various legislation which punished banks that didn't meet certain levels of 'specie' reserves."
 USA_specie_payments: "Specie Payments"

##Buchanan Political tree
 USA_buchanan_deny_scott: "Intervene in Scott Case"
 USA_buchanan_deny_scott_desc: "The case of Dred Scott v. Sanford has brought the question of slavery into the headlines once again, and now, the highest court in the land is taking up the burden of answering it. To prevent a decision made along partisan lines, President-elect Buchanan sees it fit to pressure a northern justice into taking a pro-slavery stance. If he succeeds, we just might avoid calls of judicial bias against our already-fragile government."
 USA_buchanan_address_debate: "Address the Debate"
 USA_buchanan_address_debate_desc: "In the aftermath of the Scott case, long rising tensions between North and South, Free and Slave have been brought more fully into the light. Unfortunately for us, there is practically no chance of the crisis ending on it's own as Buchanan had hoped. Because of this, we must take a stance, as not committing will certainly lead to disaster. This stance will manifest in our cabinet, which we have not yet appointed. In the Cabinet, we can either favor Southern Democrats and the Northerners allied with them, or, we can appoint a compromise cabinet and hope to save our party."
 USA_doughface_cabinet: "The Doughface Cabinet"
 USA_doughface_cabinet_desc: "We should pursue a policy of appointing officials to the Cabinet whose loyalty to the president is unquestionable, specifically from the pool of Southern Democrats who strongly favor all pro-slavery causes."
 USA_inclusive_cabinet: "An Inclusive Cabinet"
 USA_inclusive_cabinet_desc: "Though it would be best if appointed officials who were strictly loyal to the President, the feud between Buchanan and the moderate Stephen Douglas, who champions the cause of 'Popular Sovereignty' or letting all states decide whether to be slave states or not, could tear our party apart."
 USA_purge_unreliables: "Purge Unreliables'"
 USA_purge_unreliables_desc: "Those members of the administration who can not be counted on must be purged, and loyalists put in their place. Buchanan historically pursued a policy of appointing officials solely for their pro-slavery leanings."

 USA_indiscriminate_opposition: "Indiscriminating Opposition"
 USA_indiscriminate_opposition_desc: "If a candidate can not be trusted to toe the party line, they must be opposed. We must view these Northern Moderate Democrats as no different from the abolitionist Republicans."
 USA_covode_committee: "The Covode Committee"
 USA_covode_committee_desc: "The Covode Committee was convened in the House of Representatives to investigate alleged abuses and corruption by the President, going so far as searching for grounds to Impeach the President and remove him from office. Though ultimately unsuccessful it served as a lightning rod for intra-party disagreements within the democratic party which ultimately potentially contributed to Buchanan's chosen successor coming in 3rd for the popular vote later that year."
 USA_buchanan_successor: "Buchanan's Successor?"
 USA_buchanan_successor_desc: "Now has come the time to choose who shall be the chosen democratic candidate to square off against the Unionist Party under Bell, and Republican Party under Lincoln, both of whom are strong contenders. We must choose a candidate best suited for this challenge."

 USA_democrat_judicial: "Democrat Judicial"

 USA_clayton_bulwer_treaty_focus_desc: "The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty was a treaty negotiating the release of central american lands backs to the respective nations of Honduras and Nicaragua, specifically the Moskito Coast. It was President Monroe who demanded an end to European Colonialism in the Americas, and Buchanan seeks to follow his example."
 USA_mormon_alaska: "Mormon Alaska"
 USA_mormon_alaska_desc: "One of Buchanan's strangest ideas was an early purchase of Russian Alaska, with the intent of offering it to the Mormon Church, potentially seeing this as a clever way of both gaining land and settlers for a harsh frontier, and the Mormon's potentially would've taken such an offer, in their continual pursuit of lands where they could be left alone without threat of violence. We should see if the Russians at this time are prepared to part with such a barren waste."

 #Western Expansion Events
 usa.285.t: "Pikes Peak's Gold Rush!"
 usa.285.d: "For many years, people had suspected the mountains of Colorado contained numerous rich gold deposits. This rumor all began in 1835, when a French trapper named Eustace Carriere lost his party and ended up wandering through the mountains for many weeks. During those weeks he found many gold specimens which he later took back to New Mexico for examination. Upon examination, they turned out to be 'pure gold'. But when he tried to lead an expedition back to the location of where he found the gold, they came up short because he could not quite remember the location.\n\nBut many kept searching for the gold in those Rocky Mountains and several small parties explored the region. In July 1858, Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small placer deposit near the mouth of Little Dry Creek that yielded about 20 troy ounces (622 grams) of gold, which would start up the town of Denver.\n\nBut that discovery wouldn't be contained for long, for in the winter of last year this secret was exposed! If you want to mine gold yourself, spring is here and everyone is rushing to Denver! If you're worried that the early birds took it all, don't! The winter snow had made mining impossible, but now mining can begin!"

 usa.291.t: "Birth of Commercial Bison Hunting"
 usa.291.d: "Bison hunting has become a growing commercial industry alongside a game of sport for settlers. Mostly hunted to make leather so industries can craft machinery belts, military boots, and other goods.\n\nMany military officers go bison hunting food, but just as many shoot them purely for sport. The military seem to encourage the industry, since it forces the native americans to be dependent on cattle, stripping them of their nomadic way of life.

That the settler cannot restrain himself, but will hunt with such fervence that no buffalo remains. I ask...

Word has spread throughout the tribes about what was said at United States military base, Fort Dodge:\n\n'You know well that the game is getting very scarce and that you must soon have some other means of living; you should therefore cultivate the friendship of the white man, so that when the game is all gone, they may take care of you if necessary.' -General Winfield Scott Hancock"

There's no better time than now to pass through St Louis, America's Gateway to the West.\n\nThough not all believe this miracle farming technique, since it's rumored many farmers are failing to produce crop.

It was on this site that the town of Pierce was established, but only the eager miners came to weather the winter. Though the small mining town is expected to grow larger as spring makes the travel easier.\n\nThough with the discovery of gold comes to migration of settlers through native reservations.

 usa.301.t: "Legacy of Governor Isaac Stevens"
 usa.301.d: "Issac Stevens was a controversial governor during his time in office, for his role in compelling the Native American tribes of Washington Territory by intimidation and force to sign treaties that ceded most of their lands and rights to Stevens' government. These included the Treaty of Medicine Creek, Treaty of Hellgate, Treaty of Neah Bay, Treaty of Point Elliott, Point No Point Treaty, and Quinault Treaty. During this time, the Governor imposed martial law to better impose his will on the Indians and whites who opposed his views. The consequent political and legal battles would soon overshadow the Indian war.\n\nIn April 1856, Governor Stevens removed settlers whom he believed to be aiding the enemy (in many cases because they had married into local tribes) and placing them in the military's custody. Governor Stevens declared martial law in Pierce County in order to conduct a military trial of those settlers. He next declared martial law in Thurston County. But only the territorial legislature had the authority to declare martial law, and representatives fought Stevens' effort to abrogate their authority. A bitter political and legal battle ensued. On May 24, 1856, following a legal opinion rendered by Judge Chenoweth, ruling that Stevens had no legal power to declare martial law, Governor Stevens rescinded his proclamation in Pierce and Thurston counties.\n\nStevens did not hesitate to use his troops for vengeance, and waged a brutal winter campaign against the Yakama tribe, led by Chief Kamiakin. This, along with his unjustified execution of the Nisqually chieftain Leschi, led to widespread pleas to President Pierce to remove Stevens from his post. Two men were particularly vocal in their opposition to Stevens and his policies; territorial Judge Edward Lander and influential private citizen Ezra Meeker. While Meeker was ignored, Lander was arrested by Stevens' forces due to his opposition. Pierce refused to remove Stevens from his position, but eventually sent word to the governor expressing his disapproval. Any opposition eventually died down, as most white settlers in Washington Territory felt that Stevens was on 'their side', while they considered Meeker to be too sympathetic to Native Americans."
 usa.301.a: "I heard he's running for the house of representatives now..."

However, many of those slaves in the South are very disloyal against the Pro-Slave South. Those slaves who have been able to flee north must be put to work in order to rescue their families, and boost the war effort!"
 USA_Focus_ACW_The_South3: "The Men are Chattel"
 USA_Focus_ACW_The_South3_desc: "Down in the South, their main export and product is Cotton.

 USA_ACW_United_States_Colored_Troops_desc: "At the ushering of prominent abolitionist Frederick Douglas, we will officially form the United States Colored Troops as a way for black Americans to enter service into the Union Army.

 USA_Focus_ACW_Anacondra_Plan_desc: "With the majority of the navy on the Union's side, we are able to blockade the Confederacy and stop trade and movement of troops by them.

 USA_Focus_ACW_Down_With_the_Traitor: "Down with the Traitor"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Down_With_the_Traitor_desc: "The traitorous rebels in the South have held firm, but the spirit of the Union is strong! War propaganda to demonize the southern traitors must be spread throughout the Union in order to preserve our war and our Union!"

 USA_Focus_ACW_Richmond_Strategy: "The Richmond Strategy"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Richmond_Strategy_desc: "Capturing the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia is vital in order to root out the rebels. Not only is it symbolic as their capital, it would heavily disrupt Confederate administration and war-waging capabilities as Confederate officials would have to flee and regroup somewhere else."
 USA_Focus_ACW_Mississippi_Campaign: "The Mississippi Campaign"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Mississippi_Campaign_desc: "The Mississippi River is one of the most important natural supply routes in the continent. By capturing this important river, we will not only disrupt supply routes in the mid-South, we will also cut off all of the Confederacy's western armies from their high command."
 USA_Focus_ACW_March_to_Sea: "March to the Sea"
 USA_Focus_ACW_March_to_Sea_desc: "General Ulysses S. Grant has noted the importance of cutting the traitors in half, with his campaign towards Vicksburg along the Mississippi proving so. In that case, we may be able to launch another crusade across the rebels. If we were to cut the rebellion in pieces, we can surround and destroy this menace once and for all."
 USA_Focus_ACW_Operation_Cradle: "Operation Cradle"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Operation_Cradle_desc: "Despite our best efforts to cut off the Confederacy, the rebel menace has been able to deploy 'blockade-runners' that are able to simply speed past our blockading ships. In order to deal with this, Gideon Welles plans to send Union forces to amphibiously invade important ports that these 'blockade-runners' are setting sail from. The two he recommended starting with are Mobile and Charleston."
 USA_Focus_ACW_Meade_Secure_Ground: "Favorable Ground"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Meade_Secure_Ground_desc: "George Meade correctly calculates that the South holds a distinct advantage in terms of terrain and local support. It would be best for us to hold our positions in more favorable terrain."

 USA_Focus_ACW_Rattlesnake_Plan_desc: "General Lee has come up with a plan to utilize our unique advantages over the North.

 USA_ACW_Second_In_Command_McClellan_desc: "George B. McClellan, a promising young captain from Pennsylvania who chose to stay with the Union when the North rebelled and a top candidate for Lee's Second-In-Command.

 USA_ACW_Second_In_Command_Jackson_desc: "Stonewall Jackson, a major, a veteran of the Mexican-American War, and a logical choice for Lee's Second-In-Command. He's known for refusing an order to withdraw in the assault of Chapultepec Castle as a second lieutenant of the 1st U.S. Artillery Regiment. Famously, his decision resulted in a relieving brigade being able to exploit an advantage he created and capture the castle. His reputation for aggressiveness will surely help us put down the rebels."
 USA_ACW_Second_In_Command_Buchanan: "Second-In-Command Buchanan"
 USA_ACW_Second_In_Command_Buchanan_desc: "Franklin Buchanan, a navy officer and the guy behind the creation of the United States Naval Academy. Buchanan's insight as a member of the Navy for over 46 years will surely help us win the vital naval war in the Atlantic."
 USA_Focus_ACW_Philadelphia_Strategy: "The Philadelphia Strategy"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Philadelphia_Strategy_desc: "The capture of Philadelphia will be an amazing boost to our war effort. Not only would it be symbolic as it's the capital of the rebel forces, it would force the Free States' top officials and military leaders to flee and regroup, giving us ample time to exploit the disorganization in their command structure."
 USA_Focus_ACW_Michigan_Campaign: "The Michigan Campaign"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Michigan_Campaign_desc: "Michigan borders four of the Great Lakes. The Northerners are using these four lakes as secure supply lines.

 USA_Focus_ACW_March_to_Lakes: "March To The Lakes"
 USA_Focus_ACW_March_to_Lakes_desc: "Not only are the Great Lakes key to the Northern war plan, they also mark the end of their northern borders. By marching a concentrated force up to the borders of the Lakes, we can split the Northern menace in half."

 USA_Focus_ACW_Jackson_Tear_Up_Railroads: "Tear Up The Railroads"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Jackson_Tear_Up_Railroads_desc: "General Jackson has a plan to deal a finishing blow to the North.

This will damage and strain the Free States' supply lines and allow us to easily destroy their starved armies."
 USA_Focus_ACW_Buchanan_Constrict_Trade: "Constrict Trade"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Buchanan_Constrict_Trade_desc: "We need to tighten the squeeze on the North. First, move our naval forces closer to the shore to catch blockade-runners easier. Second, send amphibious forces to capture the major ports these ships are being deployed from. This will hurt the strained economy of the North even more than this insurrection already has."
 USA_Focus_ACW_Civil_War_Tactics: "Revitalized Union Morale"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Civil_War_Tactics_desc: "We are at war with our brothers, but as we begin to fight we realize it may not be such a quick victory. Perhaps if we were to begin reforming our army, we could push the traitors back."

 USA_diplomacy_greenland: "Continue Seward's Icebox"

 USA_research_wartime_organization_desc: "It is essential to learn about organization and the form of organized combat units, ranging from the level of Corps, Division, Brigade, Regiment, and down to the Company.

 usa.248.t: "The Utah War"
 usa.248.d: "The Utah War, also known as the Mormon War for the the participation of the Mormon Church, was a brief period of political instability between the Utah Territorial Government and the US Federal Government. There were many causes, including a long history of religious oppression against the Mormon people, including being driven out of more eastern states by state-sanctioned violence, the duality of governance in the territory between the federally directed government and the ecclesiastic government of the church, and by a gross ineptitude of communication and mistrust between both sides. The actual start of the conflict started when newly elected James Buchanan appointed a new governor for the territory, replacing the then current governor who was also the head of the Mormon Church, and dispatching a military escort with policing powers. The Mormons feared a new wave of federal persecution, and so refused to admit the new governor to the territory without conflict. Historically both sides eventually reached a diplomatic settlement that saw the Mormons' rights, never in real danger, respected, and federal authority respected and transition of power to a new governor."

 USA_paraguay_intervention: "The Paraguay Expedition"
 USA_paraguay_intervention_desc: "It being desirable to ascertain the fitness of the river La Plata and its tributaries for navigation by steam, the United States steamer Water Witch was sent thither for that purpose in 1853. This was successfully carried on until February 1855, when, whilst in the peaceful prosecution of her voyage up the Parana River, the steamer was fired upon by a Paraguayan fort. The fire was returned, but as the Water Witch was of small force and not designed for offensive operations, she retired from the conflict. The pretext upon which the attack was made was a decree of the President of Paraguay of October 1854, prohibiting foreign vessels of war from navigating the rivers of that State. As Paraguay, however, was the owner of but one bank of the river of that name, the other belonging to Corientes, a State of the Argentine Confederation, the right of its Government to expect that such a decree would be obeyed can not be acknowledged. But the Water Witch was not, properly speaking, a vessel of war. She was a small steamer engaged in a scientific enterprise intended for the advantage of commercial states generally. Under these circumstances I am constrained to consider the attack upon her as unjustifiable and as calling for satisfaction from the Paraguayan Government. Citizens of the United States also who were established in business in Paraguay have had their property seized and taken from them, and have otherwise been treated by the authorities in an insulting and arbitrary manner, which requires redress"

Whether it was time as a successful lawyer with an ability to redirect juries to his own visions or as a Lieutenant-Colonel of the Second Pennsylvania Volunteers during the Mexican–American War of which he acquitted himself with great distinction, much of his life’s success could be attributed to his time in the Midwestern State. Only after losing his running campaign as a Representative did he make his move to the Nebraska Territories where his current political career took shape rapidly, holding a United States Judge position in the 2nd Judicial District before rising to the position of Governor. From the streets of Pennsylvania and the Nebraska Territories to the fields of Mexico, Samuel W.
