### FOCUSES ###

 USA_buchanan_presidency: "Buchanan Presidency"
 USA_buchanan_presidency_desc: "Democratic candidate James Buchanan Jr. has won the United States Presidential Election of 1856. Having been inaugurated on March 4th of this year, he has now been in office for 68 days."
 USA_missouri_railroad: "Gateway to the West"
 USA_missouri_railroad_desc: "Fervent railroad speculation has generated a windfall for the economy and, more importantly, the Treasury. Few would mind those funds from being nudged in the right direction, especially to move more people out west. To do so, we will subsidize the construction of a new railroad in Missouri and give an easier start for the pioneers venturing outbound from Independence."
 USA_pennsylvanian_oil: "Oil Creek Discovery"
 USA_pennsylvanian_oil_desc: "[missing_desc]"
 USA_under_panic: "Panic of 1857"
 USA_under_panic_desc: "The United States is suffering under an economic collapse. The people have lost faith in the market, and the oversaturation of materials and the decline of the Californian gold rush has led to an economic crisis, exacerbated by the depression of agricultural prices with the conclusion of the Crimean War and a bubble in Railroad investments bursting!"
 USA_reform_not_relief: "Reform not Relief"
 USA_reform_not_relief_desc: "President Buchanan was a fervent anti-interventionist in economic matters. He championed a policy of letting the market go where it went and not interfering in any way."
 USA_reduced_public_works: "Defund Public Works"
 USA_reduced_public_works_desc: "In light of decreasing economic activity and government revenue, President Buchanan decreased government spending on public works."
 USA_paper_money_war: "Confiscate the 1s!"
 USA_paper_money_war_desc: "President Buchanan believed the root cause of the panic was the issuing of paper money and the substitution of 'hard' currency. He withdrew the usage of all dollar bills with nominal values under 20$ and pushed for various legislation which punished banks that didn't meet certain levels of 'specie' reserves."
 USA_specie_payments: "Specie Payments"
 USA_specie_payments_desc: "Buchanan was prepared to put his hard money where his mouth was, and instructed that all government payments be paid in hard currency and a reduction of the issuance of government bonds. This action helped decrease inflation rates and stabilize the economy."
 USA_panic_recovery: "Complete the Recovery!"
 USA_panic_recovery_desc: "After a significant amount of time, we now can see the signs of recovery, because of, or perhaps despite, Buchanan's policies. Regardless, normalcy is returning to the North, though it is still far from the good times of 1856."
 USA_buchanan_deny_scott: "Intervene in Scott Case"
 USA_buchanan_deny_scott_desc: "The case of Dred Scott v. Sanford has brought the question of slavery into the headlines once again, and now, the highest court in the land is taking up the burden of answering it. To prevent a decision made along partisan lines, President-elect Buchanan sees it fit to pressure a northern justice into taking a pro-slavery stance. If he succeeds, we just might avoid calls of judicial bias against our already-fragile government."
 USA_buchanan_address_debate: "Address the Debate"
 USA_buchanan_address_debate_desc: "In the aftermath of the Scott case, long rising tensions between North and South, Free and Slave have been brought more fully into the light. Unfortunately for us, there is practically no chance of the crisis ending on it's own as Buchanan had hoped. Because of this, we must take a stance, as not committing will certainly lead to disaster. This stance will manifest in our cabinet, which we have not yet appointed. In the Cabinet, we can either favor Southern Democrats and the Northerners allied with them, or, we can appoint a compromise cabinet and hope to save our party."
 USA_doughface_cabinet: "The Doughface Cabinet"
 USA_doughface_cabinet_desc: "We should pursue a policy of appointing officials to the Cabinet whose loyalty to the president is unquestionable, specifically from the pool of Southern Democrats who strongly favor all pro-slavery causes."
 USA_inclusive_cabinet: "An Inclusive Cabinet"
 USA_inclusive_cabinet_desc: "Though it would be best if appointed officials who were strictly loyal to the President, the feud between Buchanan and the moderate Stephen Douglas, who champions the cause of 'Popular Sovereignty' or letting all states decide whether to be slave states or not, could tear our party apart."
 USA_purge_unreliables: "Purge Unreliables'"
 USA_purge_unreliables_desc: "Those members of the administration who can not be counted on must be purged, and loyalists put in their place. Buchanan historically pursued a policy of appointing officials solely for their pro-slavery leanings."
 USA_bleeding_kansas: "Bleeding Kansas"
 USA_bleeding_kansas_desc: "The controversy over whether Kansas would join as a Free State or Slave State historically drove some of the worst civil unrest in US history, with dozens murdered for being on either side of the debate in the years leading up to finally being admitted to the Union."
 USA_doughface_judicial: "Doughface Judiciary"
 USA_doughface_judicial_desc: "Part of entrenching pro-slavery sentiment in the US Government will invariably include appointing many Southern Democrats to various appellates and federal courts."
 USA_indiscriminate_opposition: "Indiscriminating Opposition"
 USA_indiscriminate_opposition_desc: "If a candidate can not be trusted to toe the party line, they must be opposed. We must view these Northern Moderate Democrats as no different from the abolitionist Republicans."
 USA_covode_committee: "The Covode Committee"
 USA_covode_committee_desc: "The Covode Committee was convened in the House of Representatives to investigate alleged abuses and corruption by the President, going so far as searching for grounds to Impeach the President and remove him from office. Though ultimately unsuccessful it served as a lightning rod for intra-party disagreements within the democratic party which ultimately potentially contributed to Buchanan's chosen successor coming in 3rd for the popular vote later that year."
 USA_buchanan_successor: "Buchanan's Successor?"
 USA_buchanan_successor_desc: "Now has come the time to choose who shall be the chosen democratic candidate to square off against the Unionist Party under Bell, and Republican Party under Lincoln, both of whom are strong contenders. We must choose a candidate best suited for this challenge."
 USA_tolerate_douglas: "Tolerate Douglas"
 USA_tolerate_douglas_desc: "This feud between Buchanan and Senator Douglas is pointless and serves only to divide us in the face of our true opposition."
 USA_democrat_judicial: "Democrat Judicial"
 USA_democrat_judicial_desc: "Appointing solely Southern Democrats to the bench would best protect the cause of Slavery, but it would hurt our support amongst the northerners. We should be open to appointing worthy northerners so we appear unbiased."
 USA_true_opposition: "True Opposition"
 USA_true_opposition_desc: "We should support any Democrat willing to run against an abolitionist, even if they prefer policies in line with Douglas' platform. "
 USA_close_ranks: "Close Ranks"
 USA_close_ranks_desc: "Republicans in the lower house want to convene an investigation into alleged abuses by the Democratic Administration, we cannot let such investigations go through and embarrass us before what could possibly be a historic election. Crush the investigation, we don't want to know who has done what."
 USA_buchanan_diplomacy: "Buchanan Diplomacy"
 USA_buchanan_diplomacy_desc: "President Buchanan was renowned for his hawkish foreign policy, looking to expand the US in any way possible, be it via conquest or land purchase."
 USA_clayton_bulwer_treaty_focus: "Finalize the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty"
 USA_clayton_bulwer_treaty_focus_desc: "The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty was a treaty negotiating the release of central american lands backs to the respective nations of Honduras and Nicaragua, specifically the Moskito Coast. It was President Monroe who demanded an end to European Colonialism in the Americas, and Buchanan seeks to follow his example."
 USA_mormon_alaska: "Mormon Alaska"
 USA_mormon_alaska_desc: "One of Buchanan's strangest ideas was an early purchase of Russian Alaska, with the intent of offering it to the Mormon Church, potentially seeing this as a clever way of both gaining land and settlers for a harsh frontier, and the Mormon's potentially would've taken such an offer, in their continual pursuit of lands where they could be left alone without threat of violence. We should see if the Russians at this time are prepared to part with such a barren waste."
 USA_harris_treaty_focus: "The Harris Treaty"
 USA_harris_treaty_focus_desc: "Commodore Perry opened the ports of Japan to trade at the end of a cannon, but it is up to us to follow through and get guarantees of open trade with the formerly reclusive nation."
 USA_trade_treaties: "Negotiations in Asia"
 USA_trade_treaties_desc: "With recent developments in China, including the British intervention, we should exploit new treaties that give our traders an advantage in this new market."
 USA_support_mexican_liberals: "Support the Liberals"
 USA_support_mexican_liberals_desc: "The ongoing European Intervention in Mexico is an affront to everything the Monroe Doctrine stands for, we must arm our southern neighbors against these foreign invaders!"
 USA_mexican_protectorate: "The Mexican Protectorates of Chihuahua and Sonora"
 USA_mexican_protectorate_desc: "Buchanan has long viewed the relative lawlessness of the Mexican border a threat to US interests and safety. Perhaps it is time for a 2nd 'Mexican Cession'"
 USA_cuban_protectorate: "Cuban Protectorate"
 USA_cuban_protectorate_desc: "Presidents long before Buchanan have eyed the jewel of the Spanish Empire, Cuba. Buchanan himself has been a party to multiple efforts to peacefully acquire the territory, this will be one more."

 USA_buchanan_pressure_seminoles: "Pressure the Seminoles"
 USA_buchanan_pressure_seminoles_desc: "After the Second Seminole War has "concluded", the state of Florida has continued their efforts of trying to forcibly relocate the indigenous Seminole peoples.

 USA_buchanan_five_nation_approach: "Continue the Tears"
 USA_buchanan_five_nation_approach_desc: "Though the natives may say otherwise, American expansion into the west takes precedence over their needs. Manifest Destiny must prevail if we are to grow into a power capable of protecting our neighbors across both Americas, and to accomplish this, President Buchannan supports further efforts to solidify the presence of our settlers over Indian lands."
 USA_buchanan_five_nation_approach_tooltip: "Maintained the §YTreaty of Payne's Landing§!"
 USA_buchanan_five_nation_approach_effect: "This focus path will allow for §YUnrestricted Western Expansion§! providing a §Ggreater economic potential§! when finished.\n\nAs a consequence, this will generate a §Olarge amount§! of §YDetrimental Colonial Impact§! from §Roppression and exploitation§! of §YIndigenous American Tribes§!."

 USA_Focus_ACW_Mississippi_Campaign_desc: "The Mississippi River is one of the most important natural supply routes in the continent. By capturing this important river, we will not only disrupt supply routes in the mid-South, we will also cut off all of the Confederacy's western armies from their high command."

 USA_Focus_ACW_March_to_Sea_desc: "General Ulysses S. Grant has noted the importance of cutting the traitors in half, with his campaign towards Vicksburg along the Mississippi proving so. In that case, we may be able to launch another crusade across the rebels. If we were to cut the rebellion in pieces, we can surround and destroy this menace once and for all."
 USA_Focus_ACW_Operation_Cradle: "Operation Cradle"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Operation_Cradle_desc: "Despite our best efforts to cut off the Confederacy, the rebel menace has been able to deploy 'blockade-runners' that are able to simply speed past our blockading ships. In order to deal with this, Gideon Welles plans to send Union forces to amphibiously invade important ports that these 'blockade-runners' are setting sail from. The two he recommended starting with are Mobile and Charleston."
 USA_Focus_ACW_Meade_Secure_Ground: "Favorable Ground"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Meade_Secure_Ground_desc: "George Meade correctly calculates that the South holds a distinct advantage in terms of terrain and local support. It would be best for us to hold our positions in more favorable terrain."

 USA_Focus_ACW_Rattlesnake_Plan: "Rattlesnake Plan"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Rattlesnake_Plan_desc: "General Lee has come up with a plan to utilize our unique advantages over the North.

 USA_ACW_Second_In_Command_McClellan_desc: "George B. McClellan, a promising young captain from Pennsylvania who chose to stay with the Union when the North rebelled and a top candidate for Lee's Second-In-Command.

 USA_ACW_Second_In_Command_Jackson_desc: "Stonewall Jackson, a major, a veteran of the Mexican-American War, and a logical choice for Lee's Second-In-Command. He's known for refusing an order to withdraw in the assault of Chapultepec Castle as a second lieutenant of the 1st U.S. Artillery Regiment. Famously, his decision resulted in a relieving brigade being able to exploit an advantage he created and capture the castle. His reputation for aggressiveness will surely help us put down the rebels."
 USA_ACW_Second_In_Command_Buchanan: "Second-In-Command Buchanan"
 USA_ACW_Second_In_Command_Buchanan_desc: "Franklin Buchanan, a navy officer and the guy behind the creation of the United States Naval Academy. Buchanan's insight as a member of the Navy for over 46 years will surely help us win the vital naval war in the Atlantic."
 USA_Focus_ACW_Philadelphia_Strategy: "The Philadelphia Strategy"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Philadelphia_Strategy_desc: "The capture of Philadelphia will be an amazing boost to our war effort. Not only would it be symbolic as it's the capital of the rebel forces, it would force the Free States' top officials and military leaders to flee and regroup, giving us ample time to exploit the disorganization in their command structure."
 USA_Focus_ACW_Michigan_Campaign: "The Michigan Campaign"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Michigan_Campaign_desc: "Michigan borders four of the Great Lakes. The Northerners are using these four lakes as secure supply lines.

 USA_Focus_ACW_March_to_Lakes: "March To The Lakes"

 USA_Focus_ACW_Jackson_Tear_Up_Railroads_desc: "General Jackson has a plan to deal a finishing blow to the North.

 USA_Focus_ACW_Buchanan_Constrict_Trade: "Constrict Trade"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Buchanan_Constrict_Trade_desc: "We need to tighten the squeeze on the North. First, move our naval forces closer to the shore to catch blockade-runners easier. Second, send amphibious forces to capture the major ports these ships are being deployed from. This will hurt the strained economy of the North even more than this insurrection already has."

 USA_Focus_ACW_Civil_War_Tactics_desc: "We are at war with our brothers, but as we begin to fight we realize it may not be such a quick victory. Perhaps if we were to begin reforming our army, we could push the traitors back."

 USA_military_armament_s: "Southern Military Industry"

 USA_nocivilwar_industrialized_desc: "The South has begun to catch up with the North in terms of industry. Although they are still not completely equal in terms of might, with the industries of the North and South tied closer together, it will bring the North and South into much more of a Union. "

 USA_nocivilwar_wages: "Southern Wages"
 USA_nocivilwar_wages_desc: "The South is very poor compared to the North, and they have a firm belief that the South would collapse without Cotton. We need to increase Southern Industrial Wages, so that they know that they can make money off of Industry and calm their worries."
 USA_nocivilwar_relation: "Harmonize Relations"
 USA_nocivilwar_relation_desc: "The Northerners and the Southerners hold a sort of hostile attitude between each other. An example of two sides of a nation becoming Rivals was in Rome, when it split into West and East. That did not go well for Rome, we won't let it happen here."
 USA_nocivilwar_society: "Begin Assimilation"

We need to clean this idea up in order to assimilate Southern culture."
 USA_nocivilwar_music: "Music Culture"

 USA_loss_firm_stability_desc: "With the unity of the Democrats and the Republicans, we can be rid of the Anti-Republican menace that has recently erupted in the country.

The Russians have expressed desire to sell the province to us, however then we were too interested in civil issues.

 USA_diplomacy_greenland: "Continue Seward's Icebox"
 USA_diplomacy_greenland_desc: "While Alaska is great for us, William Seward wishes for more. After designing the purchase for Alaska, he now turns east to Greenland and Iceland.

 USA_research_wartime_equipment: "Wartime Equipment"
 USA_research_wartime_equipment_desc: "Weaponry was a major cause of the massive bloodshed spilt during the war. The newer versions of our rifles are very accurate, and the bullets are no longer rounded balls but Minié balls. The Minié ball made reloading time faster, and the spin of the bullet allowed for immense damage to the enemy, and would cause numerous amputations on both sides."
 USA_research_wartime_artillery: "Artillery Equipment"
 USA_research_wartime_artillery_desc: "Not only has our infantry equipment improved, but so has our artillery.

 USA_research_wartime_organization_desc: "It is essential to learn about organization and the form of organized combat units, ranging from the level of Corps, Division, Brigade, Regiment, and down to the Company.

 USA_research_wartime_navy_desc: "An important point in the war was the introduction of the Ironclad.

### EVENTS ###

USA.1.t: "These United States"
USA.1.d: "A republic birthed from revolution, these United States, and it's citizenry there within, have both gained and strive for the furtherance of their god-given inalienable rights and freedoms endowed upon them. Formerly under the rule of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, they declared their intention of independence from the tyranny of their mother country and their King, George III, on July 4th, 1776. The nation was in a bloody conflict prior to that formal declaration, finding ultimate success, with aid from both the Kingdoms of Spain and France, on September 3rd, 1783.\n\n Nearly a century since our country's founding, a lot has taken place. We have seen the Louisiana Purchase occur, gaining us a large portion of land from the French. War commenced once again with the British during the War of 1812. We've purchased Florida from Spain, were ceded Oregon from the British, and annexed the Republic of Texas. This last feat, however, brought us to war with the Mexican government, which helped aid in military reforms that ended with us earning victory and a large swathe of land from the Mexicans.\n\n With our territory spanning sea to sea, Americans can now fulfill both Manifest Destiny and their American Dream. It will not be easy for most families as braving the frontier is dangerous. Aside from natural issues, of which being the environment, disasters, and beasts of different sorts of manner, there are also numerous tribes of people some of which war with us and some of them aly and trade with us. Nevertheless, the American is a determined breed with great ingenuity and will see through the success of their goals."
USA.1.a: "Please, continue."
USA.1.b: "I am well read, thank you."
USA.2.t: "The 1856 Election"
USA.2.d: "It is obvious that the Democratic Party won the bid for Presidency, with their nominations of, then Minister to Great Britain and former Secretary of State, James Buchanan and former Representative, now Vice President, John C. Breckinridge. The Republican Party, formed two years prior, put up former Senator John C. Frémont as their Presidential Candidate and former Senator William L. Dayton as their Vice Presidential Candidate in their first run in a Presidential Election. The American Party, commonly referred as the “Know Nothings”, nominated former President Millard Fillmore for reelection as President and former Ambassador Andrew J. Donelson as their Vice Presidential Candidate.\n\n President Franklin Pierce hoped for renomination for the election, although the Democratic Party decided to go with a less controversial candidate, as Pierce signed the Kansas-Nebraska bill and the succeeding “Bleeding Kansas” conflict. Stephen A. Douglas, another possible candidate, withdrew his name from the race when Buchanan pledged not to seek reelection in the Election of 1860. With the matter of slavery being the primary focus of this election, Buchanan promised to not add nor detract from the official party platform which emphasized the non-intervention of slavery in the territories.\n\n The Republican Party's platform essentially stated that there should be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except for the punishment of crime, in any of the Territories of these United States. Their chant, due to their nominated candidate, was “Free Speech, Free Soil and Fremont.” The Democratic Parties strategy, as Bucahnan did not tour the country, instead residing in his home “Wheatland” performing political and campaign events for hundreds of visitors, was to represent the Republican Party as a bunch of radicals, as a party of disunity and described Fremont as a Catholic, a drunkard, a bastard, and an abolitionist who would destroy the union. Lastly, the American Party decided to base their platform not on the issue of slavery, but to focus on the concept of nativism, being anti-immigrant and anti-catholic, alongside the separation of Church and State."
USA.2.a: "And then?"
USA.2.b: "I recall these events."
USA.3.t: "State of the Union"
USA.3.d: "With the results in, it is confirmed that James Buchanan has secured the presidency. To prepare for his term in office, Buchanan traveled to Washington D.C. in late January and stayed at the National Hotel. Unfortunately, during his stay there and for the first three months of 1857, a bout of intestinal malady overfell residents of the hotel which was dubbed as the “National Hotel disease,” conspired to be an assassination attempt by radical abolitionists, but remained baseless rumors. Buchanan was impacted by the disease and forced to remain at his home in Lancaster with minimized visitors in the weeks before taking office.\n\n Both his trip to Washington D.C. and the day of his inauguration was a gigantic celebration, filled with parades and partying. Every resident of Washington D.C. scrambled to get the $5 entrance fee to his party. However, there was controversy within his speech that he was already aware of the decision regarding the ongoing Supreme Court case, Dred Scott v. Sandford, indicating that he might have been illegally informed.\n\n Afterwards, Buchanan would appoint his own cabinet, composed of members whose interests aligned with those of the southern states. Although he himself was a northerner who detested slavery, believed that it was not the government's role to abolish it. Thus brings him to deal with his current problem, chiefly the situation known as Bleeding Kansas. Aside from that, there are active conflicts in the state of Florida with the remnants of the Seminole tribe with the ongoing Third Seminole War."
USA.3.a: "Thank you for catching me up."
USA.4.t: "Our Intentions for the Utah Territory"
USA.4.d: "Due to both popular and political pressure, President Buchanan made a pledge on March 4th, the same day as his inauguration, to replace the current Governor of the Utah Territory, Brigham Young, who holds high leadership in the Church of Latter Day Saints, with a more secular candidate who holds closer ties to the federal government.\n\n The urgency of the matter was when Judges William Wormer Drummond and George Philander Stiles resigned from their positions and claimed the people there were seditious, amplified by the letter of nullification sent by Governor Young, stating to no longer follow federal law. Buchanan has since written many letters to different individuals, hoping to find a suitable replacement, however, there has been no luck yet. No official notification has been sent to sitting Governor Brigham Young either."
USA.4.a: "The search continues..."
USA.5.t: "The Search Concludes"
USA.5.d: "As we know from earlier in the year, President Buchanan has been on the look for a candidate to replace the Mormon Governor of the Utah Territory, Brigham Young. The news has come out that the search has now concluded with our new nomination being Alfred Cumming. He is set to travel out to the territory with his wife, Elizabeth Randall Cumming,  soon to take control of the Government in the Utah Territory, accompanied by an army of 2,500, that began organizing earlier in May, to act as peacekeepers to ensure the transfer of power goes well. To note some credentials of Cumming, he was mayor of Augusta, Georgia, a sutler to Zachary Taylor during the Mexican-American War, and negotiated with the Blackfeet Nation as the superintendent of the Central Superintendency."
USA.5.a: "We hope things go well."
USA.6.t: "Developments from the Expedition"
USA.6.d: "On July 18th, a portion of the expedition embarked on their journey towards the Utah Territory. Composed of units of Infantry and Artillery from the 10th Infantry Regiment, albeit without calvary, they make their way under the leadership of Colonel Edmund Brooke Alexander. Another matter is that Colonel William Selby Harney sent out Captain Stewart Leonard Van Vliet, a member of this expedition who has had prior encounters with the Mormon peoples and garnered their trust, to embark alone with haste in order to see if they could sell supplies for their camp."
USA.6.a: "Let's hope for good news."
USA.7.t: "The Expedition Embarks on their Journey"
USA.7.d: "The rest of the expedition has finished its preparations and Colonel Albert Sidney Johnson has been selected to relieve Colonel Harney from command. This was a long awaited change, as Colonel Harney was not able to leave with the expedition itself, and remained in Fort Leavenworth to deal with the matter of the Kansas Territory whilst handling the affairs of the expedition. He embarks out, alongside soon to be Governor Cumming and several other civilian officials with the aid of the 2nd Dragoons."
USA.7.a: "We are on the move!"
USA.8.t: "Van Vliet's Report"
USA.8.d: "Today, Captain Van Vliet rendezvoused with Colonel Alexander's group to relay intel he gathered from meeting with the Mormon government in Salt Lake City. Supposedly the Mormon people seem prepared to defend their lands, and have burnt grass from past the South Pass, which they had just reached, on the way to Salt Lake City. They seemed more than eager to burn their homes and supplies to avoid it falling into the Expedition's hands. They seem eager to keep a harassment campaign, trying to disway the Expedition from continuing though the final call lies with Colonel Alexander's decision."
USA.8.a: "We are limited on time. Onwards!"
USA.8.b: "We shall camp at the nearby Fort Laramie and wait for the rest of the Expedition."

 usa.279.t: "New England Shoemakers Cut Wages!"
 usa.279.d: "Shoemaker factories within the New England region have had to cut wage significantly during the economic panic! Many workers cite these wages are insufficient to live off of, but others say they can sustain it for a temporary time. Even so, many workers are content with simply having a job since many workers were fired during the economic panic."
 usa.279.a: "Well, temporary wage cuts are understandable during this panic..."
 usa.281.t: "The New England Mechanics Association"
 usa.281.d: "The Panic of 1857 resulted in the temporary loss of jobs for many shoemakers. Workers were also angry at the increasing mechanization of the shoemaking process, discontent with the feeling of being replaced. When companies began hiring again, the cost of shoes went up and wages declined significantly. Many workers cited this increased revenue was solely going to the owner's pockets at the detriment of the living conditions for workers. Working hours were long, about 16 hours per day, and wages were low; men were earning only $3 a week and women just $1.\n\nThus the Mechanics Association was organized to negotiate conditions with employers, and demanded pre-panic wages or better."
 usa.281.a: "This is an issue between the company and it's workers, not the government."
 usa.281.b: "Recognize them and give this organization support!"
 usa.282.t: "The New England Shoemaker Strike!"
 usa.282.d: "After a week of failed attempts of negotiation between factory employers and the New England Mechanics Association, And so they walked off the job on Washington's birthday because it was a 'fitting day for a blow in favor of the cause you engage in.'\n\nReporters covered the mass meeting at Lyceum Hall in Lynn, calling it the 'largest and most enthusiastic of its kind ever held in New England.'' The workers set up committees of 100 men each to post the names of scabs, to keep order and to make sure shoes wouldn't be finished elsewhere. They then marched to their factories and handed in their tools.\n\n'I am glad to see that a system of labor prevails in New England under which laborers can strike when they want to, where they are not obliged to labor whether you pay them or not,' wrote Abraham Lincoln. 'I like a system which lets a man quit when he wants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere.'"
 usa.282.a: "Oh."
 usa.282.a: "Let's hope that doesn't inspire strikes here..."
 usa.283.t: "The New England Shoemaker Strike Ends!"
 usa.283.d: "There was no rowdyism, and the strike leaders strongly discouraged alcohol. The strikers enjoyed community support, with businessmen contributing money and groceries and clergy denouncing the employers from their pulpits. When Boston police arrived at the train station, a crowd of 8,000 people jeered and hissed at them.\n\nThe employers were ready to raise wages by the second week of the shoemakers  strike, but refused to recognize the union. On April 10, a thousand Lynn workers went back on the job after 30 employers agreed to raise wages by 10 percent. Some held out for a few weeks longer, but the shoemakers strike had ended.\n\nThe women had already gone back to work. Though the men supported them, they didn't include the women's wage demands in their proposals. They were concerned the employers wouldn't consider their demands if they added the women's.\n\nSome employers did sign agreements with the local unions. Most of the male workers got a raise, and unions organized where previously they hadn't existed. As the Haverhill Gazette reported, “An Association of mechanics will grow out of the movement which will doubtless do much for the protection of the laborers in their rights.”"
 usa.283.a: "Well, at least it's over..."
 usa.285.t: "Pikes Peak's Gold Rush!"
 usa.285.d: "For many years, people had suspected the mountains of Colorado contained numerous rich gold deposits. This rumor all began in 1835, when a French trapper named Eustace Carriere lost his party and ended up wandering through the mountains for many weeks. During those weeks he found many gold specimens which he later took back to New Mexico for examination. Upon examination, they turned out to be 'pure gold'. But when he tried to lead an expedition back to the location of where he found the gold, they came up short because he could not quite remember the location.\n\nBut many kept searching for the gold in those Rocky Mountains and several small parties explored the region. In July 1858, Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small placer deposit near the mouth of Little Dry Creek that yielded about 20 troy ounces (622 grams) of gold, which would start up the town of Denver.\n\nBut that discovery wouldn't be contained for long, for in the winter of last year this secret was exposed! If you want to mine gold yourself, spring is here and everyone is rushing to Denver! If you're worried that the early birds took it all, don't! The winter snow had made mining impossible, but now mining can begin!"

 usa.287.d: "With the advent of standardization in firearms to supply the US military in the Mexican-American War and Seminole War fire arm production has increase significantly. Now that weapon purchases are dwindling due to these conflicts ending, firearm manufacturers are now entering the private sector to recover from the absent military market."
 usa.287.a: "Ah! Free market capitalism at it's finest!"
 usa.289.t: "The Iron Horse Reaches Kansas"
 usa.289.d: "The first railroad construction west of the Mississippi was begun in St Louis by the Pacific Railroad on July 4, 1851. The Hannibal-St Joseph rail line was the first railroad to reach the border of Kansas Territory. As we speak a junction is being made between this line and the North Missouri Railroad at Macon, Missouri, which will provide a rail service from St Louis to St Joseph."
 usa.289.a: "A great achievement!"
 usa.290.t: "The Iron Horse Reaches Kansas"
 usa.290.d: "It has been discovered the settlers have penetrated the iron horse farther west. The rails now lay way for more settlers to travel farther west in a faster amount of time."
 usa.290.a: "This will bring more settlers and the death of more buffalo..."
 usa.291.t: "Birth of Commercial Bison Hunting"
 usa.291.d: "Bison hunting has become a growing commercial industry alongside a game of sport for settlers. Mostly hunted to make leather so industries can craft machinery belts, military boots, and other goods.\n\nMany military officers go bison hunting food, but just as many shoot them purely for sport. The military seem to encourage the industry, since it forces the native americans to be dependent on cattle, stripping them of their nomadic way of life. Which ultimately makes it easier to track a stationary target."
 usa.291.a: "You don't see too many of those out east anymore..."
 usa.292.t: "The Tale of the Wasteful Hunter"
 usa.292.d: "The buffalo, the most sacred animal of our people. Who once roamed as far as the land could take you, now only prevalent on our 'reservations'.\n\nTragic is it not? That the settler cannot restrain himself, but will hunt with such fervence that no buffalo remains. I ask... What greed fuels a man towards massacring a herd and leave not even a few to replenish a it? What man can relish in the slaughtering of a buffalo and squander the bounty it provides?"

 usa.293.a: "May this actually end the tale of the wasteful hunter?"
 usa.294.t: "A Message from General Hancock"
 usa.294.d: "Our worst fears are confirmed, it was not coincidence they slaughtered buffalo needlessly. It was a strategy to destroy our way of life, to make us dependent and stationary. Word has spread throughout the tribes about what was said at United States military base, Fort Dodge:\n\n'You know well that the game is getting very scarce and that you must soon have some other means of living; you should therefore cultivate the friendship of the white man, so that when the game is all gone, they may take care of you if necessary.' -General Winfield Scott Hancock"
 usa.294.a: "Is there no limit to their hatred?"
 usa.296.t: "The New American Breadbasket?"
 usa.296.d: "Innovations within agriculture has allowed the rugged terrain of western lands like Kansas and Nebraska to grow wheat! Once though as the great American Desert, now a potential farmer's paradise. Many are now flooding these vacant lands in hope of turning a profit and owning property. There's no better time than now to pass through St Louis, America's Gateway to the West.\n\nThough not all believe this miracle farming technique, since it's rumored many farmers are failing to produce crop. Our journalists have investigated this claim, and found that only certain strains of wheat grow in this colder climate. Let's hope nobody tries to plant Pennsylvanian wheat in Nebraska!"

Out translator managed to decipher the poorly written handwriting:\n\nSon,\nThey said I could grow bountiful wheat. That this was the new breadbasket of America! They said we'd have unlimited land to claim! It was all lies, I please to thee to never come here. For God has forsaken this land! Or is this my punishment from God for leaving you...\n"

It was on this site that the town of Pierce was established, but only the eager miners came to weather the winter. Though the small mining town is expected to grow larger as spring makes the travel easier.\n\nThough with the discovery of gold comes to migration of settlers through native reservations.

 usa.301.t: "Legacy of Governor Isaac Stevens"
 usa.301.d: "Issac Stevens was a controversial governor during his time in office, for his role in compelling the Native American tribes of Washington Territory by intimidation and force to sign treaties that ceded most of their lands and rights to Stevens' government. These included the Treaty of Medicine Creek, Treaty of Hellgate, Treaty of Neah Bay, Treaty of Point Elliott, Point No Point Treaty, and Quinault Treaty. During this time, the Governor imposed martial law to better impose his will on the Indians and whites who opposed his views. The consequent political and legal battles would soon overshadow the Indian war.\n\nIn April 1856, Governor Stevens removed settlers whom he believed to be aiding the enemy (in many cases because they had married into local tribes) and placing them in the military's custody. Governor Stevens declared martial law in Pierce County in order to conduct a military trial of those settlers. He next declared martial law in Thurston County. But only the territorial legislature had the authority to declare martial law, and representatives fought Stevens' effort to abrogate their authority. A bitter political and legal battle ensued. On May 24, 1856, following a legal opinion rendered by Judge Chenoweth, ruling that Stevens had no legal power to declare martial law, Governor Stevens rescinded his proclamation in Pierce and Thurston counties.\n\nStevens did not hesitate to use his troops for vengeance, and waged a brutal winter campaign against the Yakama tribe, led by Chief Kamiakin. This, along with his unjustified execution of the Nisqually chieftain Leschi, led to widespread pleas to President Pierce to remove Stevens from his post. Two men were particularly vocal in their opposition to Stevens and his policies; territorial Judge Edward Lander and influential private citizen Ezra Meeker. While Meeker was ignored, Lander was arrested by Stevens' forces due to his opposition. Pierce refused to remove Stevens from his position, but eventually sent word to the governor expressing his disapproval. Any opposition eventually died down, as most white settlers in Washington Territory felt that Stevens was on 'their side', while they considered Meeker to be too sympathetic to Native Americans."

Faith in the Revolution seemed lost. But then, against all odds, Washington crossed the Delaware River and led our armies to glorious victory at the Battle of Trenton. \n \nNow, we find ourselves in a similar predicament. Our nation, shattered and destroyed, went from a nation known for its freedom and unity to a land of chaotic infighting. But the spark that shall burn the new Revolution across the land has been lit, and that spark was us. Against all odds, we have led our armies to victory throughout the land, and we now fly our banner all across America. Now, however, it is time that we restore the flag of freedom, the flag our fathers fought and bled for, which shall not be denied its return to our great nation! \n \nRally around the flag!"

 USA_character_james_buchanan_desc: "The 15th President of the United States, James Buchanan, is a member of the Democratic Party. Despite being a northerner, he is claimed to have pro-southern principles, this has lead to many people calling him a "doughface". Deeming northern abolitionist parties and groups to be troublesome in interfering in what he believed would be the natural gradual abolition of slavery in the south. He believes it to be futile to stop the expansion of the nation, with people attempting to settle out west over the Rockies. Though he also had some of his own ideas in regards to expansion that he hopes to come to fruition during his term."
 USA_character_samuel_black_desc: "Samuel W. Black, the 7th Governor of the Nebraska Territories, is a Democratic leaning politician with roots previously in the Pennsylvania political scene. Though a Nebraska Territories Governor currently, he spent much of his life and accolades within Pennsylvania. Whether it was time as a successful lawyer with an ability to redirect juries to his own visions or as a Lieutenant-Colonel of the Second Pennsylvania Volunteers during the Mexican–American War of which he acquitted himself with great distinction, much of his life’s success could be attributed to his time in the Midwestern State. Only after losing his running campaign as a Representative did he make his move to the Nebraska Territories where his current political career took shape rapidly, holding a United States Judge position in the 2nd Judicial District before rising to the position of Governor. From the streets of Pennsylvania and the Nebraska Territories to the fields of Mexico, Samuel W. Black is known especially for his impulsiveness, wit, courage, and chivalry, traits that accented his achievements in the courtrooms and on the battlefield."
 USA_characters_john_breckinridge_advisor_desc: "Vice President to James Buchanan, John Cabell Breckinridge is a member of the Democratic Party. On the ongoing issue of slavery, Breckinridge is torn from his morals and upholding the constitution. He believes that the institute of slavery is evil, yet still protects it due to slaves' status as property, and the constitution protects one's rights to their own property. He is also an advocate of manifest destiny. During the last election, he emphasized his belief that the Republican party would tear the nation apart."
 USA_character_roger_taney_desc: "The 5th Chief Justice, Roger Brooke Taney, was appointed by former Democratic President Andrew Jackson. He was widely respected and people believed he was going to settle the national debate over slavery. However, as we know from the recent Dred Scott case, it only bolstered the Republican party, garnering anger from north due to the decision. This ultimately could be because of his support of slavery."
 USA_character_lewis_cass_desc: "The 22nd Secretary of State, Lewis Cass, is a member of the Democratic Party. He is a veteran of the War of 1812, reaching the rank of brigadier general, and participating in the Battle of the Thames. Under President Andrew Jackson, he was appointed as Secretary of War and aided his policy of Indian Removal. In regards to the issues of slavery, he's an advocate for popular sovereignty."
 USA_character_howell_cobb_desc: "The 22nd Secretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb, is a member of the Democratic Party. He sided with former Democratic President Andrew Jackson on the question of nullification and was a passionate advocate for the extension of slavery but came around to support the Compromise of 1850."
 USA_character_john_floyd_desc: "The 24th Secretary of War, John Buchanan Floyd, is a member of the Democratic Party. He is pro-slavery and almost got in trouble, as governor of Virginia, when he recommended to the Virginia General Assembly to pass a law taxing imports from states refusing to return fugitive slaves owned by Virginian masters. This would have violated the Interstate Commerce Clause."
 USA_character_jeremiah_black_desc: "The 24th Attorney General, Jeremiah Sullivan Black, is a member of the Democratic Party. He gradually became one of the leading American lawyers, serving as a Chief Justice on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court."
