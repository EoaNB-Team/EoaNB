 SKT_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Uprisings, inspired by Islam, are sprouting all over west Africa. In 1804 the revolutionary Usman dan Fodio formed the Sokoto Caliphate, the largest of the Fulani Jihad states. The Fulani Revolutions aim to end corruption, bring stability to Africa, and become the bulwark against colonialism. To the East, the old Kanem-Bornu Kingdom is in decline and are no longer able to resist the Caliphate. To the West the other Fulani Jihad states are occupied fighting French colonialism. Now is the time for the true Islamic Caliphate to rise!"
