Valverde is a liberal politician who agrees a lot with our way of doing politics, while the leader of the coup, General Santana, is a politically unpredictable caudillo. We could offer arms or even volunteers to President Valverde in exchange for money to ensure a friendly government in the Caribbean or we could not get involved in the war that seems more favorable to General Santana who has the support of the Dominican army."
