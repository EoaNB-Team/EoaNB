 persia.1.t: "Amir Kabir's Military Reforms"
 persia.1.d: "Amir Kabir, the powerful and visionary Grand Vizier of Persia, has introduced sweeping reforms to modernize the Qajar army. For centuries, our military has relied on outdated strategies, equipment, and organization, leaving us vulnerable to the encroaching imperial powers of Europe. Amir Kabir believes that in order to preserve Persian sovereignty and protect the Shah's reign, we must adopt Western military techniques, streamline recruitment, and modernize our weaponry\n\nThe reforms include the establishment of military academies, the creation of a standing army trained in the latest European tactics, and the procurement of modern rifles and artillery. However, this move has not gone unnoticed. The conservative factions at court, fearful of change, believe these reforms will undermine traditional power structures and lead to the loss of Persian identity. The same goes for the different Tribes in our country, who fear losing their autonomy in military affairs. On the other hand, many military officers and modernist intellectuals view Amir Kabir's reforms as a necessary step to ensure the survival of the empire in a rapidly changing world."
 persia.1.a: "Support Amir Kabir's Reforms!"
 persia.1.a_tt: "The future of Persia belongs to those who embrace change."
 persia.1.b: "Slow down, Persia isn't ready for this."
 persia.1.b_tt: "Amir Kabir’s ideas are too radical; The pride of Persia lies in its traditions, not foreign imitations."
 persia.1.c: "Choose neither side, at least for now"
 persia.1.c_tt: "Reforms have their place, but tradition cannot be cast aside so easily. Persia must find its own path, balancing both the old and the new."
 
 persia.2.t: "Plans for Army Centralization"
 persia.2.d: "With the Amir Kabir reforms just beginning to take root, the government has initiated plans to fully centralize the Qajar army. Historically reliant on the contributions of tribal forces, our military has suffered from disunity, with tribal leaders maintaining significant autonomy over their soldiers, equipment, and structure. This has resulted in inefficiency and a lack of standardization, leaving Persia vulnerable to both internal and external threats.\n\n The centralization process will aim to reduce the influence of tribal leaders over military affairs, bringing the entire army under the direct control of the state. To achieve this, uniforms, rifles, artillery, and division structures will need to be standardized across the board, ensuring that every soldier, regardless of origin, is equipped and trained in the same manner.\n\n Additionally, the possibility of introducing conscription is being discussed. While this would bolster the ranks of a national standing army, it remains a contentious issue. Tribal leaders, who have historically controlled recruitment in their regions, are likely to oppose such a move, viewing it as an attack on their authority and the independence of their tribes.\n\n Though these reforms still have to be put into practice, their successful implementation will mark a new era of military unity in Persia—but the government must carefully manage the delicate balance of power with the tribal factions to avoid unrest."
 persia.2.a: "Time for change has come"
 persia.2.a_tt: "The time has come to unite Persia’s military under one banner. Though the path ahead is difficult, the state's control over the army must be strengthened to face the challenges of the modern world."

 persia.3.t: "The Tribal Armies Will Remain"
 persia.3.d: "After careful consideration following the initial Amir Kabir reforms, the government has chosen to maintain Persia’s long-standing reliance on the tribal armies. While efforts to modernize the military have been put forward, we have decided to focus on tradition and preserve the autonomy of the tribal forces. The diverse tribes of Persia have been the backbone of our military strength for centuries, and their loyalty remains crucial to the stability of the Shah’s reign.\n\n Rather than reduce the influence of the tribal leaders, the government will now shift its efforts toward strengthening and supporting their armies. This will involve improving the equipment and training available to tribal forces while respecting their unique traditions and command structures. Instead of imposing standardized uniforms or conscription, we will seek to cultivate stronger ties with the tribal chieftains and secure their loyalty through mutual cooperation and respect.\n\n By reinforcing the tribal armies, the government aims to create a decentralized yet resilient military force that can respond flexibly to threats while maintaining the delicate balance of power within the empire. This approach preserves Persia’s identity and ensures that the tribes remain a key part of our military strategy, even as the world around us modernizes."
 persia.3.a: "Ok"
 persia.3.a_tt: "The strength of Persia lies in its tribes. Rather than force change upon them, we will embrace their traditions and secure their loyalty through support, not suppression."
