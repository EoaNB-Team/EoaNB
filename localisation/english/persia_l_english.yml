 persia.1.t: "Amir Kabir's Military Reforms"
 persia.1.d: "Amir Kabir, the powerful and visionary Grand Vizier of Persia, has introduced sweeping reforms to modernize the Qajar army. For centuries, our military has relied on outdated strategies, equipment, and organization, leaving us vulnerable to the encroaching imperial powers of Europe. Amir Kabir believes that in order to preserve Persian sovereignty and protect the Shah's reign, we must adopt Western military techniques, streamline recruitment, and modernize our weaponry\n\nThe reforms include the establishment of military academies, the creation of a standing army trained in the latest European tactics, and the procurement of modern rifles and artillery. However, this move has not gone unnoticed. The conservative factions at court, fearful of change, believe these reforms will undermine traditional power structures and lead to the loss of Persian identity. The same goes for the different Tribes in our country, who fear losing their autonomy in military affairs. On the other hand, many military officers and modernist intellectuals view Amir Kabir's reforms as a necessary step to ensure the survival of the empire in a rapidly changing world."
 persia.1.a: "Support Amir Kabir's Reforms!"
 persia.1.a_tt: "The future of Persia belongs to those who embrace change."
 persia.1.b: "Slow down, Persia isn't ready for this."
 persia.1.b_tt: "Amir Kabir’s ideas are too radical; The pride of Persia lies in its traditions, not foreign imitations."
 persia.1.c: "Choose neither side, at least for now"
 persia.1.c_tt: "Reforms have their place, but tradition cannot be cast aside so easily. Persia must find its own path, balancing both the old and the new."
 
 persia.2.t: "Plans for Army Centralization"
 persia.2.d: "With the Amir Kabir reforms just beginning to take root, the government has initiated plans to fully centralize the Qajar army. Historically reliant on the contributions of tribal forces, our military has suffered from disunity, with tribal leaders maintaining significant autonomy over their soldiers, equipment, and structure. This has resulted in inefficiency and a lack of standardization, leaving Persia vulnerable to both internal and external threats.\n\n The centralization process will aim to reduce the influence of tribal leaders over military affairs, bringing the entire army under the direct control of the state. To achieve this, uniforms, rifles, artillery, and division structures will need to be standardized across the board, ensuring that every soldier, regardless of origin, is equipped and trained in the same manner.\n\n Additionally, the possibility of introducing conscription is being discussed. While this would bolster the ranks of a national standing army, it remains a contentious issue. Tribal leaders, who have historically controlled recruitment in their regions, are likely to oppose such a move, viewing it as an attack on their authority and the independence of their tribes.\n\n Though these reforms still have to be put into practice, their successful implementation will mark a new era of military unity in Persia—but the government must carefully manage the delicate balance of power with the tribal factions to avoid unrest."
 persia.2.a: "Time for change has come"
 persia.2.a_tt: "The time has come to unite Persia’s military under one banner. Though the path ahead is difficult, the state's control over the army must be strengthened to face the challenges of the modern world."

 persia.3.t: "The Tribal Armies Will Remain"
 persia.3.d: "After careful consideration following the initial Amir Kabir reforms, the government has chosen to maintain Persia’s long-standing reliance on the tribal armies. While efforts to modernize the military have been put forward, we have decided to focus on tradition and preserve the autonomy of the tribal forces. The diverse tribes of Persia have been the backbone of our military strength for centuries, and their loyalty remains crucial to the stability of the Shah’s reign.\n\n Rather than reduce the influence of the tribal leaders, the government will now shift its efforts toward strengthening and supporting their armies. This will involve improving the equipment and training available to tribal forces while respecting their unique traditions and command structures. Instead of imposing standardized uniforms or conscription, we will seek to cultivate stronger ties with the tribal chieftains and secure their loyalty through mutual cooperation and respect.\n\n By reinforcing the tribal armies, the government aims to create a decentralized yet resilient military force that can respond flexibly to threats while maintaining the delicate balance of power within the empire. This approach preserves Persia’s identity and ensures that the tribes remain a key part of our military strategy, even as the world around us modernizes."
 persia.3.a: "Ok"
 persia.3.a_tt: "The strength of Persia lies in its tribes. Rather than force change upon them, we will embrace their traditions and secure their loyalty through support, not suppression."

 persia.4.t: "The Akhunds: A Growing Presence in Persia"
 persia.4.d: "The Akhunds, a powerful faction within the Shia clergy, have long influenced the lives of the Persian people. They position themselves as the protectors of Islamic values, seeking to control religious teachings and exert influence over political decisions. Over the years, their presence has only grown, often challenging the authority of the Shah and the state. They claim to guide the people spiritually, but their ambitions extend far beyond the mosque. As Persia moves forward, the role of the Akhunds becomes an obstacle the monarchy must contend with."
 persia.4.a: "The Akhunds claim to lead with faith, but their grip tightens around Persia’s future."

 persia.5.t: "An Audience with the Ayatollahs"
 persia.5.d: "The Shah has summoned the most prominent Ayatollahs to Tehran for an audience, aiming to discuss the future of Persia. The clergy, firm in their belief that Shia Islam should guide the empire, have laid out their vision for Iran — a society deeply rooted in Islamic tradition and resistant to the influences of Western modernisation. As the Ayatollahs presented their goals, many hopeful reformists in the Shah's court expressed their concerns, fearing that the clergy's ambitions may stand in the way of the much-needed reforms that could propel Persia into a new era."
 persia.5.a: "The Ayatollahs and Shah stand together"
 persia.5.b: "Iran first Islam second"

 persia.6.t: "The Mullahs Protest the Shah’s Lack of Commitment"
 persia.6.d: "The construction of masjids has long been a critical demand of the Shia clergy, as they see these religious structures as a cornerstone of Persian society. However, after 180 days without the Shah committing the necessary funds, the mullahs have begun to protest openly. They accuse the Shah of neglecting his religious duties and turning his back on Islam. These protests have spread to the streets, with the clergy stirring up discontent among the faithful, demanding that their spiritual needs be met."
 persia.6.a: "To neglect the masjids is to neglect the will of Allah, the mullahs declare, as unrest begins to grow."

 persia.7.t: "The Shah’s Grand Reform Speech"
 persia.7.d: "The Shah has called for a grand gathering of his advisors, ministers, and representatives of the clergy to announce his vision for the future of Persia. In a bold and ambitious speech, he outlines sweeping reforms aimed at modernizing the military, government, and educational systems. The speech is met with a mix of applause and scepticism. The clergy, in particular, seem uneasy, fearing that these changes will undermine their influence. The Shah now faces the challenge of implementing these reforms while managing the growing dissent among the religious elites."
 persia.7.a: "Move forward with full reforms, regardless of clerical opposition."
 persia.7.b: "Incorporate some of the clergy’s demands into the reforms."

 persia.8.t: "Mullahs Denounce Western Schools"
 persia.8.d: "As the Shah continues to build and promote Western-style schools in Persia, opposition from the clergy has grown louder. A coalition of mullahs has publicly denounced these institutions as a threat to Islamic teachings, calling them breeding grounds for heresy and Western corruption. The public, torn between modernization and religious values, looks to the Shah for guidance. Will he side with the clergy and limit the spread of these schools, or will he stand firm in his commitment to modernization?"
 persia.8.a: "Limit the influence of Western schools to appease the clergy."
 persia.8.b: "Continue building the schools, but promise to include more religious studies."

 persia.9.t: "A Clerical Uprising in the Provinces"
 persia.9.d: "In one of the more rural provinces of Persia, a powerful local cleric has begun to rally the population around the idea that the Shah’s reforms are a threat to Islam itself. He has denounced the Shah’s efforts to modernize the empire as an attack on religious values. The local population is growing restless, with protests breaking out in several towns. The mullahs are watching the situation closely, waiting to see how the Shah responds. The Shah must decide whether to meet with the cleric, crush the unrest, or ignore the situation entirely."
 persia.9.a: "Meet with the cleric to ease tensions."
 persia.9.b: "Crush the uprising"

 persia.10.t: "The Ayatollah’s Call for Religious Unity"
 persia.10.d: "A prominent Ayatollah has issued a public call for the unification of Persia under the banner of Shia Islam. The Ayatollah claims that in these uncertain times, the nation must look to its spiritual roots and reject foreign influences. The clergy is rallying behind this call, with sermons across the country urging the faithful to follow the guidance of the mullahs and resist the encroaching modern influences of the West. The Shah faces a choice—allow the clergy to grow stronger or intervene to ensure the monarchy’s dominance."
 persia.10.a: "Support the call for religious unity and strengthen the clergy."
 persia.10.b: "Remain neutral and let the clergy’s influence rise naturally."

 persia.11.t: "French Guns and Artillery Arrive"
 persia.11.d: "The long-awaited shipment of military equipment from France has finally arrived in Persia. The crates contain 1,500 P1851 Minié rifles and 250 smoothbore artillery pieces, marking a significant step forward in modernizing our armed forces. These advanced weapons will be distributed to key units within the Persian army, enhancing our capability to defend against external threats and internal instability.\n\n The French rifles and artillery, praised for their reliability and firepower, represent a crucial moment in the ongoing military reforms. However, this new equipment will require extensive training for our soldiers to fully utilize its potential. Still, the Shah’s government views this as a major success in securing foreign support and bolstering Persia’s military strength against the encroaching powers."
 persia.11.a: "The sound of French weapons echoes in the hands of Persian soldiers, marking the beginning of a stronger, modern army."

 persia.12.t: "Prussian Guns and Artillery Arrive"
 persia.12.d: "A shipment from Prussia has reached our capital, delivering 1,500 Dreyse M/54 rifles and 250 RML field guns. These weapons, renowned for their precision and modern design, will provide our forces with much-needed firepower. The Dreyse rifle, in particular, offers a revolutionary bolt-action mechanism, granting our soldiers a faster rate of fire and greater accuracy on the battlefield.\n\n While this shipment strengthens our position, it also highlights the need for further training and logistical support to fully integrate this advanced weaponry into our army. Nevertheless, the arrival of these Prussian arms marks another milestone in Persia's modernization efforts."
 persia.12.a: "With Prussian rifles in hand, our forces gain the tools they need to defend Persia’s sovereignty."

 persia.13.t: "Austrian Guns and Artillery Arrive"
 persia.13.d: "The latest shipment of military equipment from Austria has arrived, bringing 1,500 Lorenz M/1854 rifles and 250 howitzers into the hands of Persian forces. The Lorenz rifle, one of the most accurate and durable weapons in Europe, will grant our soldiers an edge in both defensive and offensive operations. The accompanying howitzers, capable of devastating enemy positions, provide us with the heavy artillery needed to combat larger and more advanced armies.\n\n While the integration of Austrian equipment will take time, this delivery is a significant boost to our efforts at modernizing the Qajar military. The loyalty of key tribal and state forces is strengthened by this arrival, knowing that Persia is taking steps to safeguard its future."
 persia.13.a: "The Austrian guns now in Persian hands are a symbol of our commitment to a powerful, united army ready to face any threat."

 persia.14.t: "The Gathering Storm"
 persia.14.d: "As the 1870s unfold, Qajar Persia finds itself at a critical juncture. The nation is experiencing a severe economic downturn characterized by faltering harvests and skyrocketing food prices. These economic challenges are not isolated but are instead the result of a broader pattern of financial mismanagement and ineffective governance.\n\n The economic difficulties are exacerbated by the burdensome foreign concessions imposed on Persia, which have siphoned off valuable resources and placed additional strain on our finances. Key concessions, such as those concerning the Reuter Concession, have left the economy weakened and vulnerable. This situation has been further aggravated by the administrative inefficiencies and corruption that plague our government, undermining any attempts at effective crisis management.\n\n The worsening economic conditions are beginning to manifest in widespread public discontent. Reports of hunger and hardship are increasingly common, and the frustration among the populace is palpable. We are now facing growing pressure to address the crisis, but the path forward is fraught with difficulties.\n\n The urgency of the situation demands immediate and decisive action to prevent the crisis from spiraling out of control. The choices made in the coming months will determine whether the country can stabilize and recover or whether it will continue to deteriorate, with potentially dire consequences for both the administration and the people."
 persia.14.a: "Increase Relief Efforts"
 persia.14.b: "Implement Economic Reforms"

 persia.15.t: "Relief Efforts Begin"
 persia.15.d: "In response to the escalating famine that has gripped the nation, our launched relief efforts which aim to provide essential support to the most affected regions. Recognizing the urgent need to address the crisis, we have mobilized resources to distribute food supplies and establish makeshift aid stations across the hardest-hit areas. This comprehensive relief operation seeks to alleviate the most pressing symptoms of the famine, offering temporary respite to those who are suffering from severe shortages of food and essential goods.\n\n The relief efforts involve a coordinated approach, with government agencies working alongside local authorities and charitable organizations to ensure that aid reaches the most vulnerable populations. Emergency food rations are being distributed, and temporary shelters are being set up to provide support to displaced individuals. Additionally, measures are being taken to stabilize local markets and prevent price gouging, which could exacerbate the suffering of the population.\n\n While these initial actions are intended to bring some relief and restore a semblance of stability, we should acknowledge that these efforts alone will not fully resolve the underlying issues causing the crisis. An Administration, established to fight the crisis, is preparing to undertake further measures to address the root causes of the famine and to implement longer-term solutions to prevent future occurrences. For now, the focus remains on mitigating the immediate impacts of the crisis and providing support to those in dire need."
 persia.15.a: "The Shah must know what he's doing"

 persia.16.t: "The Relief Efforts Prove Effective"
 persia.16.d: "The relief efforts organized by the Shah's administration are finally beginning to show results. Distribution of food and aid supplies has reached many of the hardest-hit regions, bringing much-needed relief to the population. Makeshift aid stations have been established across the country, providing critical assistance to those in need. These efforts, while far from perfect, have significantly alleviated the immediate effects of the famine, reducing the death toll and restoring hope to the people.\n\n Though the crisis is not yet fully over, we have earned praise for our swift response. Foreign observers, initially critical of Persia’s inability to manage the situation, are now recognizing our proactive measures. Among the people, a cautious optimism begins to take root. Communities that were once on the brink of collapse are beginning to stabilize. However, we should still keep in mind that the road to full recovery remains long and uncertain, and further efforts will be required to bring the country back to stability."
 persia.16.a: "Ok"

 persia.17.t: "Stabilization and Recovery"
 persia.17.d: "With the worst of the crisis probably behind us, Persia has entered a period of stabilization and slow recovery. The famine, though devastating, has been brought under control through coordinated relief efforts that saw food supplies and aid distributed to the hardest-hit areas. Though far from fully healed, the nation is finally seeing the first glimmers of hope. The markets, once paralyzed by the scarcity of food and basic goods, have begun to show signs of life as trade resumes. Agriculture, boosted by government support, is gradually returning to pre-crisis levels, and the fear that once gripped the hearts of the populace is slowly subsiding.\n\n We are now enjoying a surge in political capital. Our decisions, particularly the proactive relief efforts, are being praised as the actions that saved Persia from complete collapse. International observers, particularly from Britain and Russia, are watching with growing confidence as the nation claws its way back from the brink. Diplomatically, Persia's relations with these major powers are improving, especially given the perception that Persia has emerged stronger, not weaker, from this calamity. The newfound stability has allowed the administration to shift its focus from merely surviving the crisis to laying the groundwork for future growth and development. For the first time in years, the nation dares to dream of a better future, free from the shadow of famine and economic ruin."
 persia.17.a: "Nice"

 persia.18.t: "A New Era of Rebuilding"
 persia.18.d: "With the devastating famine and economic crisis finally behind us, Persia enters a new era of rebuilding and growth. The worst of the hardship has passed, and we can now shift our focus towards laying a strong foundation for the future. The nation, once teetering on the brink of collapse, has been stabilized through coordinated relief efforts, effective policies, and strategic governance. As a result, the people of Persia can now look forward to a brighter future.\n\n The administration is capitalizing on this newfound stability by advancing a series of ambitious reforms and development projects. Roads that were once neglected are being repaired, trade routes that had withered during the crisis are being revitalized, and cities are beginning to bustle with renewed commercial activity. In the agricultural sector, innovative techniques introduced to prevent future famines are taking root, and farmers are once again producing the food needed to sustain the nation. We can now focus on modernization, aiming to elevate Persia’s standing among the world’s rising powers.\n\n Diplomatically, Persia’s position has strengthened significantly. Foreign powers like Britain, who had been concerned about our ability to recover, are now viewing the country in a new light. Our successful management of the crisis has earned international respect. As Persia moves toward further growth and development, its diplomatic standing and influence are poised to expand, allowing the country to navigate the complex political landscape of the era with greater confidence. This moment represents not just the recovery from a crisis but the dawn of a new era in Persian history."
 persia.18.a: "A new hope in Persia"

 PER_state_of_the_economy: "The state of the economy"
 PER_state_of_the_economy_desc: "Persia stands at a crossroads. Our economy is a blend of ancient agrarian traditions and fledgling industries, vulnerable to the influence of foreign powers and struggling to support our nation’s aspirations. To rise as a modern power, we must confront the economic challenges within our borders, harness our resources, and carefully navigate the interests of Britain and Russia, both eyeing our wealth with ambition. With careful reform and investment, we can steer Persia toward prosperity—or face the consequences of stagnation and dependency. The choices we make will shape Persia’s destiny for generations to come."
 PER_european_imports_persian_exports: "European imports, Persian exports"
 PER_european_imports_persian_exports_desc: "With Persia's resources and goods attracting increasing interest from European markets, the time is ripe to open our economy to new opportunities. Establishing structured trade routes for exporting Persian products—silk, carpets, spices, and the newly discovered oil reserves—will foster prosperity and connect us to the global market. However, European imports will bring both modern innovations and the potential risk of economic dependence. Balancing this exchange can lead to lasting wealth for Persia while securing our independence. Will we harness this flow of commerce to empower our nation, or fall under the weight of foreign influence?"
 PER_the_cotton_market: "The cotton market"
 PER_the_cotton_market_desc: "The fertile plains of Persia offer a prime opportunity to expand into the cotton industry, a commodity that is in high demand across Europe. By developing cotton farms and establishing processing facilities, we can become a major player in the global cotton market, attracting lucrative trade deals and solidifying our economic standing. However, focusing on a single cash crop brings risks, especially as cotton prices can be volatile and subject to foreign manipulation. Careful management of this industry could usher in an era of economic growth—or leave us vulnerable to external pressures."
 PER_cotton_growers_in_isfahan: "Cotton growers in Isfahan"
 PER_cotton_growers_in_isfahan_desc: "Isfahan, with its fertile lands and strategic location, is poised to become the heart of Persia’s cotton industry. By supporting local growers and investing in infrastructure, we can establish Isfahan as a center for cotton production, creating jobs and increasing our exports. This expansion will not only boost the regional economy but also strengthen our national revenue. However, such growth may attract foreign interest and influence, and we must ensure that Persia reaps the benefits without surrendering control over this vital resource."
 PER_expand_the_carpet_weaving_industry: "Expand the carpet weaving industry"
 PER_expand_the_carpet_weaving_industry_desc: "Persian carpets are renowned worldwide for their intricate designs and unmatched quality, representing the artistry and heritage of our people. Expanding this industry not only preserves our cultural legacy but also opens a valuable revenue stream through exports. By investing in workshops and skilled artisans, we can elevate Persian carpets to new markets while creating stable jobs at home. However, rapid expansion may lead to an increased dependence on foreign markets, making us vulnerable to shifting tastes and trade dynamics. Will our carpets adorn the homes of the world’s elite, or will we fall prey to market fluctuations?"
 PER_persian_looms: "Persian looms"
 PER_persian_looms_desc: "The looms of Persia have woven stories into rugs for generations, each thread capturing a piece of our culture and history. By enhancing our weaving techniques and upgrading our looms, we can increase the quality and quantity of Persian carpets, appealing to a growing market of European buyers. Investing in modernized equipment and training for our artisans will ensure our carpets remain unmatched in beauty and craftsmanship. Yet, with this growth comes the challenge of maintaining traditional methods amidst increased production. Can we balance heritage with progress, or will the pressure for profit unravel the soul of our craft?"
 PER_the_textile_industry: "The textile industry"
 PER_the_textile_industry_desc: "Persia's textile industry holds the potential to transform our economy by producing clothing, fabrics, and other goods that meet both domestic needs and foreign demands. By investing in textile mills, expanding workforce training, and modernizing equipment, we can establish a reliable industry capable of competing on the world stage. The benefits of this growth will ripple across the nation, creating jobs and reducing our reliance on foreign imports. However, rapid industrialization risks destabilizing traditional crafts and creating economic dependencies. Will we weave a future of prosperity, or risk unraveling the balance within our society?"
 PER_trade_boom_with_europe: "Trade boom with Europe"
 PER_trade_boom_with_europe_desc: "European interest in Persian goods has surged, offering us an unprecedented chance to expand our exports and fill the coffers of the empire. With a high demand for Persian textiles, carpets, spices, and minerals, a robust trade partnership with Europe could bring lasting prosperity and modernize our economy. Yet, relying heavily on these foreign markets poses risks, as economic dependency and foreign influence could threaten our sovereignty. Will we ride this wave of prosperity to become an economic powerhouse, or allow Europe’s interests to dictate our future?"
 PER_import_european_goods: "Import European goods"
 PER_import_european_goods_desc: "With Europe at the forefront of industrial and technological advancements, importing their goods presents an opportunity to modernize Persia’s economy and improve the quality of life for our people. From machinery to luxury items, European products could elevate our industries, inspire local innovation, and satisfy the growing demand for modern conveniences. However, relying too heavily on imported goods could stifle Persia’s own industries and create dependency. Will we embrace foreign imports to advance our nation, or risk becoming consumers of Europe’s prosperity rather than creators of our own?"
 PER_increase_tariffs: "Increase tariffs"
 PER_increase_tariffs_desc: "In response to the rising influence of foreign goods flooding our markets, the time has come to consider increasing tariffs on imports. By imposing higher tariffs, we can protect our burgeoning industries from unfair competition, encourage local production, and bolster government revenue. This protectionist stance may shield Persian businesses and artisans from the challenges of foreign imports, but it risks straining our trade relationships and raising consumer prices. Will this strategy foster a resilient economy, or will it invite backlash from our trading partners?"
 PER_tea_and_sugar_imports: "Tea and sugar imports"
 PER_tea_and_sugar_imports_desc: "The demand for tea and sugar has surged in Persia, driven by changing consumer preferences and cultural trends. By securing favorable trade agreements for these imports, we can not only meet domestic needs but also elevate our status as a key player in regional trade. However, heavy reliance on imported goods poses risks, including price fluctuations and potential supply chain disruptions. Balancing our imports with local production will be crucial.

PER_QAJAR_TOOLTIP: "Of Turkic origin, the £faction_per_qajar §YQajar§! tribe rules Persia and are based in Tehran. The tribe’s people hold key political and military roles, particularly in the northern and central regions of Persia."
PER_BAKHTIARI_TOOLTIP: "The £faction_per_bakhtiari §YBakhtiari§! are £faction_per_lurs §YLurs§! from the Zagros Mountains in western Persia. They live a semi-nomadic life, controlling key mountain passes in the Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari region, and remain influential due to their military strength."
PER_QASHQAI_TOOLTIP: "A confederation of Turkic nomads, the £faction_per_qashqai §YQashqai§! inhabit Fars Province in southwestern Persia. They resist central control, moving seasonally between pastures, and maintain strong tribal traditions rooted in their Central Asian origins."
PER_KURDISH_LUR_TOOLTIP: "The £faction_per_kurds §YKurds§! live in the northwestern mountains, while the £faction_per_lurs §YLurs§! inhabit the Zagros Mountains. Both groups maintain their independence from the central government, relying on their rugged terrain and tribal alliances."
PER_TURKMEN_TOOLTIP: "The £faction_per_turkmen §YTurkmen§! are nomadic Turkic people living in northeastern Persia, near the Khorasan region. Known for their cavalry and raiding, they often resist the £faction_per_qajar §YQajar§! authority and maintain their Central Asian heritage."
PER_BALUCH_TOOLTIP: "The £faction_per_baluch §YBaluch§!, of ancient Indo-Iranian origin, live in southeastern Persia, primarily in Baluchistan. Their remote desert homeland allows them to operate independently with minimal interference from the central government."
PER_SHAHSAVAN_AFSHAR_TOOLTIP: "The £faction_per_shahsavan §YShahsavan§! live in northwestern Persia, especially around Ardabil, and are loyal to the £faction_per_qajar §YQajar§!. The £faction_per_afshar §YAfshars§!, once powerful, now reside mainly in Khorasan, still adhering to their Turkic tribal customs."
PER_KHAMESH_TOOLTIP: "Formed to counter the £faction_per_qashqai §YQashqai§!, the £faction_per_khamseh §YKhamesh§! Confederation includes Arab, Turkic, and Persian tribes living in Fars Province. They are generally loyal to the £faction_per_qajar §YQajar§! government and were created to balance power in the region."
PER_STRENGTH_TOOLTIP: "§YStrength§! represents the tribe's military power. \nIf kept unchecked, a tribe might cause troubles to the £faction_per_qajar §YQajars§! in various ways be it raids, harassments or even an open revolt. \n§YStrength§! will effect how simple or hard it would be to integrate or destroy the tribe."
PER_LOYALTY_TOOLTIP: "§YLoyalty§! represents the tribe's desire to cooperate with the £faction_per_qajar §YQajars§!. \nThe higher the §YLoyalty§!, the less likely it is that a tribe will confront and cause troubles. \nBefore integrating a tribe, it is necessary to complete certain decisions to align their population and increase their §YLoyalty§! to 100."
PER_POPULARITY_TOOLTIP: "§YPopularity§! represents the support a tribe receives from the overall population. \nThe higher the §YPopularity§!, the more likely it is that a tribe will confront the £faction_per_qajar §YQajars§!. \nBefore destroying a tribe, it is necessary to complete certain decisions to weaken it and reduce its §YPopularity§! to 0."
