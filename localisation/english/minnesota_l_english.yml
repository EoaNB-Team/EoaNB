 ### CHARACTERS ###

l_english:
 MIN_character_samuel_medary_desc: "Samuel Medary, born February 25, 1801, in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, moved to Bethel, Ohio, in 1825, where he thrived as a printer and editor, embodying Democratic individualism as a Jacksonian who served in the Ohio House (1834) and Senate (1836-1838), advocating states' rights, western expansion, Texas and Oregon annexation, and opposing abolitionism to preserve national harmony; dubbed the 'Old Wheel-Horse of Democracy' for his vigorous partisanship through the Ohio Statesman (1838-1857), he helped nominate Polk in 1844 and presided at the 1856 Cincinnati convention. Appointed by Buchanan on March 23, 1857, as Minnesota Territory's third governor, Medary arrived amid settlement and land disputes, applying expansionist zeal and pragmatism to promote growth, popular sovereignty on slavery, and balanced federal-local relations as a Union guardian against radicals; by May 11, 1857, his pro-Southern 'doughface' sympathies marked him for compromise"
