 ### CHARACTERS ###

l_english:
 MIN_character_samuel_medary_desc: "Samuel Medary, born on February 25, 1801, in Montgomery Square, Pennsylvania, to a farming family and educated at Norristown Academy, apprenticed as a printer before relocating to Ohio around 1825, where he became a leading journalist and Democratic leader as owner and editor of the Ohio Sun in Batavia and the Ohio Statesman in Columbus until 1857, using his platform to advance Jacksonian ideals like western expansion via Texas and Oregon annexation, states' rights, limited federal overreach, and popular sovereignty to address slavery disputes. His career featured terms in the Ohio House (1834), Senate (1836-1838), as state auditor (1834-1839), and postmaster of Columbus (1845-1849), alongside influential roles at Democratic conventions, including aiding Polk's 1844 nomination and presiding pro tem in 1856, earning him the nickname 'Old Wheel-Horse of Democracy' for his reliable, pragmatic party service. Appointed by President Buchanan in March 1857 as Minnesota Territory's third governor amid its statehood drive, he took office on April 23, emphasizing administrative stability through his secretary Charles L. Chase in a territory buzzing with land booms and settlers; by May 1857, his tenure reflected a measured, delegate-reliant style from Ohio experience."

Later, after Minnesota's transitional progress, Medary returned to Ohio in mid-1858 for editorial work and Democratic support amid Kansas tensions, leading to his November 23, 1858, recess appointment as Kansas Territory's fourth governor to succeed Robert J. Walker and calm 'Bleeding Kansas' violence between pro- and anti-slavery groups, where he applied his moderate expansionist views and popular sovereignty advocacy to push the Lecompton Constitution's approval for slave-state entry and Union preservation. Known for diligence, print eloquence, and a conciliatory firmness in Democratic tenets—favoring sectional balance through judicial and local means over federal dictates—Medary is regarded as a dependable yet sometimes absentee administrator, with critics noting his proxy dependence as potentially undermining direct governance."
