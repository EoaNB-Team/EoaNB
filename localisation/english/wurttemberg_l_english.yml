 ###Events###
 wurttem.0.t: "Wilhelm I Dead!"
 wurttem.0.d: "On the 25th of June 1864, Wilhelm I, having reached the age of 83 years, has died of old age in the Rosenstein castle. Having led the [WUR.GetAdjective] people for many years with great success, the King was widely popular amongst his people. The burial of Wilhelm I will be carried out five days after his death, to be accompanied by his son and successor Karl I."
 wurttem.0.a: "The country mourns."
 wurttem.1.t: "Emigration Stops"
 wurttem.1.d: "Following our recent policies on emigration, we have successfully stopped the waves of people leaving our country. This outcome will greatly benefit us in the long term, but will probably bring little results at the start. Either way, the new workforce of [Root.GetName] should now be able to boost our economy."
 wurttem.1.a: "Good to hear!"
 wurttem.2.t: "Emigration Continues"
 wurttem.2.d: "Following our recent and rather harsh policies on emigration, the discouraged [Root.GetAdjective] people continue to leave our country, in search of better work and life. Our workforce will take a toll because of this development, but experts do not expect to see serious consequences up until a few years."
 wurttem.2.a: "Why would one want to leave [Root.GetName] anyway?"
 #3 is same as 1
 #4 uses 2
 wurttem.4.d: "Even with our recent tries to advertise our country to settlers and farmers, the [Root.GetName] people still see no point in staying in our country. As they leave to find new work and life, taking their families with them, our workforce gets smaller by the day."
 wurttem.5.t: "Recovering from Unemployment"
 wurttem.5.d: "Thanks to our efforts, the dire situation regarding unemployment in our country is steadily improving. It will take time, for sure, but seeing how things seem to be getting better we should expect the employment rate to rise in a matter of a year or maybe even less."
 wurttem.5.a: "Wunderbar!"
 wurttem.6.t: "[WUR.GetName] Integrates Liberalism"
 wurttem.6.d: "Just this morning [WUR.GetNameDef] has announced their intentions on integrating Liberalism into their political system. Having experienced an uprise in popularity, Liberalism in [WUR.GetNameDef] is now stronger than ever, with supporters outside and inside the governmental structure. With Liberalism on the rise, the [WUR.GetAdjective] officials decided that they would rather talk things out than continuing the European trend of suppression.\nWhether this decision will have a greater impact on the German areas is yet to be seen. It is, however, quite clear that [WUR.GetNameDef] has developed into a state capable of thinking outside the box."
 wurttem.6.a: "This is the dawn of a new era for us."
 wurttem.6.b: "We should support their cause."
 wurttem.6.c: "Liberalism has no future in Europe."
 wurttem.7.t: "Württemberg Stands Against Liberalism"
 wurttem.7.d: "Just this morning [WUR.GetNameDef] has announced their intentions on further suppressing Liberalism in their country, seeing how the recent instabilities of the German areas have increased interest in and popularity of Liberalism. Feeling that the [WUR.GetAdjective] state might be endangered by the new Liberalistic behaviours and ideas, [WUR.GetLeader] has officially called for reactionary politics, stating that Liberalism in Germany is merely a \"periodic fever of wishes for elections\".\nWhether this decision will have a greater impact on the German areas is yet to be seen."
 wurttem.7.a: "It is for our own good."
 wurttem.7.b: "This is unheard of!"
 wurttem.7.c: "We should support their cause."
 wurttem.8.t: "The Schultheißwesen"
 wurttem.8.d: "For a long time have we utilized the Schultheißwesen now, a decentralized political system describing how every city and village is required to elect a representative who then acts as a head of the said commune. While this system allows for self-administration, it still involves the Gemeinderat, the council of a commune led by the representative, having judicative power over the affiliated area. We either could let the Gemeinderat have its judicative, or reform this system in such a way that we have more influence over it."
 wurttem.8.a: "We need to have more influence. Centralization is key now."
 wurttem.8.b: "Enforce the current version of the system."
 wurttem.9.t: "The Shifting Flow"
 wurttem.9.d: "Just now we received word from [WUR.GetLeader] himself that he would like [WUR.GetNameDef] to remain neutral on all fronts, shifting from supporting one nation to another if needed. While this might sound hypocritical at first, it would allow us to establish connections with the nations around us."
 wurttem.9.a: "This sounds like a great idea!"
 wurttem.9.b: "It would mean sitting in the shadows of others. We want none of that."
 wurttem.10.t: "Württemberg Proposes Establishing Friendship"
 wurttem.10.d: "Today we received a letter from [WUR.GetNameDef], stating that [WUR.GetLeader] would personally like to establish a lasting friendship and foreign policy with us. However, we also received word that we were not the only ones who received such letters. While we would not lose anything if we would accept, we should be aware that this kind of opportunism could go either way; lead to difficulties later, or become a great stone to step on later."
 wurttem.10.a: "We should accept this offer."
 wurttem.10.b: "We will not meddle with states trying to be friends with everyone."
 wurttem.11.t: "[From.GetName] Accepts!"
 wurttem.11.d: "We just received a letter from [From.GetNameDef], stating that they accept our proposal and look forward to a lasting friendship."
 wurttem.11.a: "A toast to our new [From.GetAdjective] friends!"
 wurttem.12.t: "[From.GetName] Denies!"
 wurttem.12.d: "We just received a letter from [From.GetNameDef], stating that they would rather have a neutral stance towards us than a binding friendship."
 wurttem.12.a: "We have to accept their decision."
 wurttem.13.t: "[WUR.GetNameDef] Invitation to Meeting"
 wurttem.13.d: "Today we received a letter from [WUR.GetNameDef], inviting us to a meeting between the leaders of the Russian Empire, French Empire and [WUR.GetName]. Stating that his intentions are those of peace, [WUR.GetLeader] personally wants to see us and talk about the latest European events and politics overall. Additionally, [WUR.GetLeader] states that we could even try to strike a deal with our rival, [WUR_zweikaisertreffen_tag_addition], when it comes to the question of the conflicts in Italy."
 wurttem.13.a: "Wa accept the invitation. Maybe this could lead us somewhere."
 wurttem.13.b: "We deny the invitation. We want none of that."

 wurttem.15.t: "Zweikaisertreffen in Stuttgart"
 wurttem.15.d: "Today, both [FRA.GetLeader] and [RUS.GetLeader] from [FRA.GetNameDef] and [RUS.GetNameDef] have visited Stuttgart, the capital of [WUR.GetNameDef] at the invitation of [WUR.GetLeader]. The Emperors were given places to stay in, namely the Residenzschloss and Villa Berg. The event was viewed as being of big importance by both the [WUR.GetAdjective] people and politicians abroad, and accompanied by numerous festivals and operas.\nWith the three leaders able to talk about European politics on neutral ground, the [RUS.GetName] successfully managed to finally break through the political isolation caused by the Crimean War and the [FRA.GetName] received a promise of neutrality from [RUS.GetNameDef] in the case of war in Italy."
 wurttem.15.a: "We are pleased with the result."
 wurttem.15.b: "Interesting."
 wurttem.16.t: "The Failure of the Zweikaisertreffen"
 wurttem.16.d: "Today, the Stuttgarter operas remained silent. With both [FRA.GetLeader] from [FRA.GetNameDef] and [RUS.GetLeader] from [RUS.GetNameDef] having declined the invitation of [WUR.GetLeader] from [WUR.GetNameDef], no political discussions between the two Empires could take place. Commenting on this event, [WUR.GetLeader] expressed his \"disappointment about this event\", but would still be open for a meeting, should the two big powers decide otherwise one day."
 wurttem.16.a: "Disappointing."
 wurttem.16.b: "We would have gained nothing from this."
 wurttem.16.c: "European politics are failing."
 wurttem.17.t: "Karl I Ascends to the Throne"
 wurttem.17.d: "With the death of his father Wilhelm I, his son Karl I will now take the place of the King of [WUR.GetName]. After the enthronement of Karl I is carried out, the new King will proceed to review the current political issues within our country and address them. King Karl I is highly motivated by the wish of becoming a great King and doing justice to his father and will do everything necessary to ensure [WUR.GetNameDef]."
 wurttem.17.a: "Heil to our new King!"
 wurttem.18.t: "Liberalization in [WUR.GetName]"
 wurttem.18.d: "With [WUR.GetLeader] having ascended to the throne, the King has decided that our government needs a few reforms. The Liberals are currently an unsolved problem in our nation and the King finally wants to address this issue. The main point of the King is that our government has been too oppressing for too long, and that a couple of liberal reforms would do the nation some good.\nNow that our path is set, it will take a bit of time and efforts to push through our reforms."
 wurttem.18.a: "This is the start of a new era for us."
 wurttem.19.t: "Liberalization in [WUR.GetName]"
 wurttem.19.d: "Finally, all of the reforms are finished. The process of liberalization has made a lot of progress and the Liberals are now an integrated part of our government. We can finally leave the issue of the Liberals in our country behind us."
 wurttem.19.a: "The King was right all along!"
 wurttem.20.t: "Suppression in [WUR.GetName]"
 wurttem.20.d: "With [WUR.GetLeader] having ascended to the throne, the King has decided that our government needs a few reforms. The Liberals are currently an unsolved problem in our nation and the King finally wants to address this issue. The main point of the King is that our government has been too lax for too long, and that a couple of conservative reforms would do the nation some good.\nNow that our path is set, it will take a bit of time and efforts to push through our reforms."
 wurttem.20.a: "This is the start of a new era for us."
 wurttem.21.t: "[RUS.GetLeader] Visits Stuttgart"
 wurttem.21.d: "Today, [RUS.GetLeader] from [RUS.GetNameDef] was invited to Stuttgart, [WUR.GetName] by [WUR.GetLeader]. With [FRA.GetLeader] from [FRA.GetNameDef] having denied the same invitation, [RUS.GetLeader] and [WUR.GetLeader] would go on to discuss European politics by themselves. The event was met with joy from the [WUR.GetAdjective] populace, with festivals held throughout [WUR.GetName]. Still, [WUR.GetLeader] commented that he would welcome [FRA.GetLeader] to Stuttgart with open arms at all times."
 wurttem.21.a: "Good times."
 wurttem.21.b: "We would have gained nothing from this."
 wurttem.21.c: "Interesting."
 wurttem.22.t: "[FRA.GetLeader] Visits Stuttgart"
 wurttem.22.d: "Today, [FRA.GetLeader] from [FRA.GetNameDef] was invited to Stuttgart, [WUR.GetName] by [WUR.GetLeader]. With [RUS.GetLeader] from [RUS.GetNameDef] having denied the same invitation, [FRA.GetLeader] and [WUR.GetLeader] would go on to discuss European politics by themselves. The event was met with joy from the [WUR.GetAdjective] populace, with festivals held throughout [WUR.GetName].

 wurttem.22.b: "We would have gained nothing from this."
 wurttem.22.c: "Interesting."
 wurttem.23.t: "[WUR.GetName] Against Liberalism"
 wurttem.23.d: "[WUR.GetNameDef] has approached us today, calling for a suppression of Liberalism throughout the southern German areas. As they are reaching out to every single neighbour of theirs, we now too have to decide on how to handle this issue. We could either support their cause, suppressing Liberalism in our own country, or deny this proposal."
 wurttem.23.a: "Liberalism is a curse. We support this cause."
 wurttem.23.b: "Liberalism is the future. We are against this."
 wurttem.24.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts our Proposal"
 wurttem.24.d: "A letter reached us today, stating that [FROM.GetNameDef] will happily support our cause of suppressing Liberalism. With the few neighbours we do have, this is a great achievement for us."
 wurttem.24.a: "Against Liberalism we stand together."
 wurttem.25.t: "[FROM.GetName] Denies our Proposal"
 wurttem.25.d: "A letter reached us today, stating that [FROM.GetNameDef] will not support our cause of suppressing Liberalism. With the few neighbours we do have, this is a setback for us."
 wurttem.25.a: "Liberalism will be their end."
 wurttem.26.t: "Suppression in [WUR.GetName]"
 wurttem.26.d: "Finally, all of the reforms are finished. The process of suppression has made a lot of progress and the Liberals are now a much smaller part of our government. We can finally leave the issue of the Liberals in our country behind us."
 wurttem.26.a: "The King was right all along!"
 wurttem.27.t: "The North"
 wurttem.27.d: "A letter from [WUR.GetNameDef] came in today, stating that the [WUR.GetAdjective] state would like to strengthen their relationship to the North, meaning us. Coming off as a weird decision at first, seeing how [WUR.GetName] has been a south-oriented German state for so long, it could mean that [WUR.GetName] sees us as superior. This in turn would mean that the South would lose a potential ally in the case of war. We should decide on what we are going to tell them and whether to treat them as an ally or not."
 wurttem.27.a: "We accept their proposal. A southern ally will strengthen our stance in Germany."
 wurttem.27.b: "We deny their proposal. Southerners will forever stay southerners."
 wurttem.28.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees"
 wurttem.28.d: "A letter from [PRS.GetNameDef] came in today, stating that they accept our proposal and look forward to the cooperation between our states."
 wurttem.28.a: "Wunderbar!"
 wurttem.29.t: "[FROM.GetName] Denies"
 wurttem.29.d: "A letter from [PRS.GetNameDef] came in today, stating that they deny our proposal and would rather see being a neutral."
 wurttem.29.a: "We stand alone."
 wurttem.30.t: "The German Stance"
 wurttem.30.d: "The time has come for us to decide on our side. With German tensions on the rise, we will have to choose a side to fight on, if the need arises. We will have to keep in mind, however, that choosing the wrong side may result in our damnation.\n\nThe first option for us to go with would be the Austrians in the south. Knowing the importance of tradition, culture and religion, the Austrians will do whatever required to maintain these German values.\n\nThe second option for us would be the middle states themselves. Definitely weaker than Austria or Prussia by themselves, it could be a risky option to take. However, if the middle states, especially Bavaria, decide on doing the same as us, it could mean the formation of a new Third Deutschland in Europe.\n\nThe last option for us to go with would be the Prussians. The Prussians have proved their military might before and it would be the doing of a fool to neglect that power. Still, we have to remember that we could get encircled by anti-Prussian powers in the south."
 wurttem.30.a: "The Austrians would be great ally."
 wurttem.30.b: "The southern states have to stand up by themselves!"
 wurttem.30.c: "The Prussians will not let us down."
 wurttem.31.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Wants To Support Us"
 wurttem.31.d: "A letter with the [FROM.GetAdjective] ensign reached us today. In this letter [FROM.GetLeader] states that [WUR.GetNameDef] would like to support us in exchange for an alliance. With this we would gain one more ally in the German areas, and [WUR.GetName] would receive our protection."
 wurttem.31.a: "The more allies the better. We accept."
 wurttem.31.b: "We can handle it on our own. We deny."
 wurttem.32.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts!"
 wurttem.32.d: "After they received our letter, [FROM.GetLeader] decided that it would be a good idea to have us as an ally. Effectively, if war was to break out, we would be protected by [FROM.GetName]."
 wurttem.32.a: "Together we are strong!"
 wurttem.33.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Denies!"
 wurttem.33.d: "After they received our letter, [FROM.GetLeader] decided that they do not need our help. Effectively, if war was to break out, we would stand on our own."
 wurttem.33.a: "We stand alone in these troubled times..."
 wurttem.34.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Wants To Support Us"
 wurttem.34.d: "A letter with the [FROM.GetAdjective] ensign reached us today. In this letter [FROM.GetLeader] states that [WUR.GetNameDef] would like to support us in exchange for an alliance.

 wurttem.35.t: "[BAV.GetNameDef] and [BAD.GetNameDef] Accept!"

 wurttem.35.a: "The middle states grow stronger!"
 wurttem.36.t: "[BAV.GetNameDef] and [BAD.GetNameDef] Deny!"
 wurttem.36.d: "After they received our letter, both [BAV.GetName] and [BAD.GetName] denied our proposals. We now stand alone in these troubled times."
 wurttem.36.a: "The Trias is officially dead."
 wurttem.37.t: "[WUR.GetNameDef] Stands With Austria"
 wurttem.37.d: "After many letters sent back and forth between the two German states, [WUR.GetNameDef] finally decided to settle with [AUS.GetNameDef] as their ally, should war in the German areas break out. This decision, however, did not come as a surprise to many, seeing how [WUR.GetName] is a south German state. Still, this proves that the idea of the Trias, an alliance between the south German states in order to become the third German power, the \"Third Deutschland\" as it is sometimes called, is now officially a thing of the past."
 wurttem.37.a: "Our future shines as bright as the sun!"
 wurttem.37.b: "One more ally on our side."
 wurttem.37.c: "Interesting."
 wurttem.38.t: "[WUR.GetNameDef] Stands With Prussia"
 wurttem.38.d: "After many letters sent back and forth between the two German states, [WUR.GetNameDef] finally decided to settle with [PRS.GetNameDef] as their ally, should war in the German areas break out. Many were surprised by this decision, seeing how [WUR.GetName] is a south German state with their Prussian allies all the way up in the north. Still, this proves that the idea of the Trias, an alliance between the south German states in order to become the third German power, the \"Third Deutschland\" as it is sometimes called, is now officially a thing of the past."
 wurttem.38.a: "Our future shines as bright as the sun!"
 wurttem.38.b: "One more ally on our side."
 wurttem.38.c: "Interesting."
 wurttem.39.t: "[WUR.GetNameDef] Stands With The Middle"
 wurttem.39.d: "After many letters sent back and forth between the southern German states, [WUR.GetNameDef] finally decided to settle with the middle states as their allies, should war in the German areas break out. Surprising everyone, the idea of the Trias, the \"Third Deutschland\" as it is sometimes called, seemingly gained a lot more traction in the past few months. Whether this Third Deutschland is to remain, however, is still to be seen."

 wurttem.41.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Wants To Support Us"
 wurttem.41.d: "A letter with the [FROM.GetAdjective] ensign reached us today. In this letter [FROM.GetLeader] states that [WUR.GetNameDef] would like to support us in exchange for an alliance.

 wurttem.43.d: "Accepting our proposal, the [FROM.GetAdjective] state has decided to continue maintaining our mutual friendship. Thanks to this we can now safely assume that [FROM.GetName] will accept most of our proposals."
 wurttem.43.a: "Ein Prosit auf unsere Freunde!"
 wurttem.44.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Abandons Friendship"
 wurttem.44.d: "Denying our proposal, the [FROM.GetAdjective] state has decided to abandon our mutual friendship due to various tensions rising in the German areas. This most certainly means more neutral relations between our two nations."
 wurttem.44.a: "How could they do such a thing?"
 wurttem.45.t: "[WUR.GetNameDef] Proposes the Establishment of the Trias"
 wurttem.45.d: "[WUR.GetName], our neighbour in the south of the German lands, lately has been motivating the middle states for the formation of the Trias, or the Third Deutschland, as some people call it. Essentially being a confederation or league of sorts, the Trias will establish a third power besides Prussia and Austria in the south. Liking this idea, [WUR.GetName] now officially proposed the formation of said Trias league. As such, both us and [BAD.GetNameDef] receive an invitation. If one of us declines, the Trias will break down, as it requires both [BAV.GetName] and [BAD.GetName] for its formation. When deciding on whether to accept or deny this proposal, however, we should keep in mind that becoming the third German power could have consequences."

 wurttem.48.t: "Trias Established!"
 wurttem.48.d: "As both [BAV.GetNameDef] and [BAD.GetNameDef] have accepted our proposal regarding the formation of the Trias, we, the three south German states of the Trias, are now allied to each other. As this form of Trias has no leader per se, each and every member can voice their concerns and ambitions if they want to. However, to ensure the inner stability of this structure, [BAV.GetName] will act as a representative of the Trias."
 wurttem.48.a: "May the Third Deutschland flourish and thrive!"
 wurttem.49.t: "[BAV.GetName] Accepts!"
 wurttem.49.d: "Word reached us that [BAV.GetNameDef] has accepted our proposal regarding the Trias. Now, it is up to [BAD.GetNameDef] to decide whether the Trias will be established or not."
 wurttem.49.a: "We welcome our [BAV.GetAdjective] friends!"
 wurttem.50.t: "Russia Intervenes in Italy"
 wurttem.50.d: "Following the Italian invasion of [LVN.GetNameDef], [RUS.GetNameDef] felt like they were obliged to send some divisions in order to help out the [AUS.GetAdjective]s against the Italians. The reasoning behind this decision is not entirely clear, however it is likely that due to Franco-Sardinian relations [RUS.GetNameDef] saw this as an opportunity to weaken [FRA.GetNameDef].\nIt is said that the divisions are due to arrive in a few days."
 wurttem.50.a: "Our actions are just."
 wurttem.50.b: "We thank them deeply."
 wurttem.50.c: "The Russians, huh?"
 wurttem.51.t: "Russian Help Arrives"
 wurttem.51.d: "The Russian divisions have finally arrived. As long as the war goes on, these divisions will fight on our side."
 wurttem.51.a: "May god bless their souls."
 wurttem.52.t: "Intervention in Italy"
 wurttem.52.d: "Seeing how another war has broken out on the Italian peninsula with the [PIE.GetAdjective] side backed by the [FRA.GetAdjective], we now have the chance of helping out the [AUS.GetAdjective]s by sending in a few divisions. We must decide quickly, however, as this will be our only chance of intervening."
 wurttem.52.a: "Against the [FRA.GetAdjective] we shall fight."
 wurttem.52.b: "The [AUS.GetAdjective]s will be fine on their own."
 wurttem.53.t: "No More Political Isolation"
 wurttem.53.d: "After having attended the Zweikaisertreffen in Stuttgart, the capital of [WUR.GetNameDef], we finally managed to get out of the political isolation the Crimean War plunged us in."
 wurttem.53.a: "Finally!"
