###Imperial Japan
 JAP_imperial.32.t: "The Tsukiji Hotel-Japans First Western Hotel " #24
 JAP_imperial.32.d: "September 1868 saw the end of the Edo era and the beginning of the prosperous Meiji era. The Tsukiji Hotel, Japan's first totally Western-style hotel, was erected in the Tsukiji Teppozu neighborhood of Tokyo during the first year of Meiji. The final Edo Shogunate intended for this hotel to be utilized primarily by foreigners, but plans were altered once the Tokugawa Shogunate fell and the Meiji Restoration rose. The idea began to fall apart early this year, with American architect Richard P. Bridgens drawing the basic concept and renowned Japanese architect Kisuke Shimizu II in charge of the building's functioning design and overall construction.\n \nIt is designed in an eclectic style that incorporates traditional Japanese and Western features. The outside incorporates Japanese-style architectural elements such as namako-style walls, which are more commonly seen around storehouses and samurai households. This, paired with more Westerner-style architectural aspects such as the chimney and weather vane on the roof, as well as the veranda that wraps around the structure, is said to set it apart from others. Kisuke Shimizu went into greater detail, stating that each of the more than 100 bedrooms has a working fireplace and a flushing toilet. Many of the British foreigners expected to stay have praised the hotel, comparing it to the best hotels in Europe.\n \nIt not only has contemporary accommodations but also offers a variety of activities. In addition to providing vital duties as a transportation hub, communication post, and other trade post services, it also has a stagecoach stop and a private post office at its front door. All together, it has gained a renowned view among the locals and is a token of the city."

 JAP_imperial.33.t: "Hebon-shiki Rōmaji" #25
 JAP_imperial.33.d: "James Curtis Hepburn, an American Presbyterian missionary doctor, released the first Japanese-English dictionary in 1867, titled "A Japanese and English Dictionary; With an English and Japanese Inde which included a novel technique for romanizing Japanese into Latin form. Now in 1872, he introduced his second edition of the book, with only some minor changes from the first. Hepburn remains the dominant romanization style compared to other systems because the system's orthography is based on English phonology rather than a systematic transcription of the Japanese syllabary. Most foreign language students studying in Japan use it, with it commonly used to romanize human names, places, and other information like railway tables and road signs."

 JAP_imperial.34.t: "Osaka Police Department" #26
 JAP_imperial.34.d: "Mutsuhiro Wantanabe grimaced at the ramshackle building in front of him. "There is no way this is the police department," he muttered to himself. Glancing around, Mutsuhiro observed vendors flanking the entrance, selling pan-fried noodles that made his stomach grumble. Behind him, the dirt streets of Osaka were thronged with people. Turning back to the building, he reluctantly approached a nearby vendor.\n\n"Excuse me, is this the Osaka police department?!" Mutsuhiro screamed over the cacophony enveloping them.\n\n"Yes it is, and you must be the new guy from Tokyo!" The vendor, a small man with snow-white hair, hollered back to Wantanabe.\n\n"How did you know that?" Mutsuhiro inquired.\n\n"Just come with me." The old man removed his apron, revealing a ragged uniform underneath, accompanied by a withered, rusty badge. "My name is Ida. The rest of the department is waiting for you in here."\n\nAs the doors shut behind them, the noise faded away, replaced by a musty smell that did no favors for his sense of smell. Wantanabe expected a crowd, but instead, a mere ten men presided over the entirety of Osaka. He had a multitude of words he wanted to say, among which was the plethora of vulgarity he wished to unleash in his next telegram to Tokyo. Instead, he pulled a cigarette out of his case and lit up. After taking a long drag, Mutsuhiro spoke.\n\n"As you might have heard from the telegram, my name is Mutsuhiro Wantanabe. I am the new Captain of the Osaka Police Department. Two years ago, at the behest of the Emperor, I traveled with a delegation to Europe in order to learn how policing is done in civilized nations. Upon my return, I was assigned to this wonderful city. Actually… I shouldn't say wonderful. I've read the reports; it's a mess. At least three murders every night, Yakuza dogs walk the streets like they own the place, hell, I didn't even feel safe walking here in broad daylight. Yet here we are cooking noodles."\n\nIda raised his hand, "Heichou, we aren't street vendors out of choice. We need the extra revenue-"\n\n"Not anymore, Ida. Emperor Meiji expanded the budget for every prefecture. By next week, we can move out of this dump, get you some proper uniforms, new firearms, and some secretaries to start filing our cases. Most importantly, we'll get enough officers and detectives to make sure no one can escape the long arm of the law. Any questions?"\n\nAnother hand was raised, this time by a gangly man sitting on a splintery chair not made for a man his size. He too was smoking a cigarette.\n\n"Are you Samurai?"\n\nMutsuhiro took a drag. Even though he was dressed in his western garb and smoking western cigarettes, people still pegged him as a Samurai. Would it be this way for the rest of his life? Exhaling smoke from his nose, he responded curtly."
 JAP_imperial.34.a: "I was—a long time ago. Not anymore."
 JAP_imperial.35.t: "A Late Night at the Station" #27
 JAP_imperial.35.d: "It had been a long day for Ida Kobashigawa. But, at his age, all days were long days. Nevertheless, the elderly man could still walk and see. That was enough for him to keep going. While his coworkers slinked off to brothels or to their wives, Ida didn't have a home life to speak of, and he assumed the new Captain didn't either. Hence, why they reamined to be the only two in the station.\n\n"Another late night, huh Captain?"\n\n"Yep, we're still short-staffed, so I can't take time out of the day to help us settle into the new building. Help me unpack these boxes." Ida sauntered over to Captain Wantanabe and slowly unpacked the freshly stamped imports. Within, he saw shiny pistols, badges, and pristine uniforms.\n\n"So, Ida, what keeps you here so late?" Mutsuhiro inquired. "I have no one waiting for me at home, which leaves me to assume the same for you." Ida responded, lifting the uniforms out of the box.\n\nMutsuhiro sighed, "Sorry to hear that. If it makes you feel better, you were right to assume no one is waiting for me at home. During the tour of Europe and America, I always had my fellow travelers to keep me company, but now I'm on my own."\n\TThe glumness of Mutsuhiro's finishing remarks took Ida off guard. "Woah, way to bring down the mood, Captain."\n\nMutsuhiro, unsure how to respond, continued his unpacking in awkward silence. It was only after the sun went down, and the men were ready to call it a night, that conversation filled the police station again.\n\n"Say, Captain, how about instead of... this-" Ida gestured to the boxes that still needed unpacking, "We get something to eat instead? Pick each other's brains. You said you were a samurai once, correct? I'm quite curious to know more."\n\nWantanabe had turned to leave, but before he stepped out of the station, he turned back to the elderly policeman."
 JAP_imperial.35.a: "That would be nice, Ida. I bid you goodnight."

###Italy
 risorgimento.998.t: "Società Geografica Italiana"
 risorgimento.998.d: "Today, a group of young scholars established the “Italian Geographical Society”. In accordance with the provisions of its Statute, the Italian Geographical Society claims to not concern itself solely with applied research. The main goal of its policy, they argue, is the advancement of geographical knowledge ; expanding, updating or innovating knowledge but also fostering geographic culture and environmental awareness, which always seem too limited and yet are absolutely vital. The Society seeks to foster geographic culture in various ways. The first,obvious and traditional, is that of documentation. The second, more daring route, is that of expedition, adventure, and Pioneering."
 risorgimento.998.a: "This will further our Intellectual Prestige!"
 risorgimento.999.t: "A New Grand Galleria?"

 nap_france_flavor.36.d: "The public in and around the Salon des Refusés has begun outcries and scandals over a recent addition by French painter Édouard Manet. His work, Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass) depicts two scarcely clothed women, one having a picnic with two fully dressed men.

 usa.341.d: "Only a day after the report of yesterday’s event, tragedy strikes again! Under the command of William Lewis Herndon, a veteran of the Mexican-American War, left port at Colón, New Granada, heading towards New York City carrying 30,000 pounds (14,000 kg) of gold, only making one stop at Havana, Cuba. Nature works in sick and twisted ways though because as the ship was travelling along the coast of the Carolinas, they were caught in a hurricane! For two days they struggled with the storm until the ship couldn’t take it anymore. The crew spent the entire night trying to save the ship but it was to no avail. Luckily, the next morning two ships were spotted. The brig Marine was the first ship that lent aid, saving 153 passengers, mainly women and children, however they couldn’t continue as the ship sank and the harsh winds made the task more difficult. The other ship, a bark named Ellen, saved an additional fifty from the waters. It is reported that about 425 people, including the captain, were killed in the sinking and the gold was also lost in the event."

Rusk had a very long political history starting with the Republic of Texas where he served as the first Secretary of War and also as a general in the Battle of San Jacinto. His service to Texas did not end there; he also held positions in the Texan senate and even as Cheif Justice of their Supreme Court as well as a variety of military positions. Rusk fought for annexation of Texas into the United States and was elected as a senator representing Texas before his election to be President pro tempore.

Jones became very bitter after his term as President ended as he expected to be elected to the US Senate to represent Texas, but was defeated by his former political allies. Despite becoming very wealthy from planting he could never get over his continued failed attempts at representing his state, which many report is the reason for his suicide. His death comes only months after the suicide of Thomas Jefferson Rusk- another important figure in Texan politics."

 usa.346.t: "Flying Eagle cent released for circulation"
 usa.346.d: "Out with the large cent, in with the Flying Eagle. The large cent was becoming increasingly unpopular and getting too expensive to coin, therefore the US Mint has decided to replace the coin with a smaller coin made up of a composition of 88% copper and 12% nickel. The  coin is nicknamed “Flying Eagle” due to the depiction of an eagle on the front of the coin, designed by James B. Longacre who took inspiration from his predecessor, Christian Gobrecht. This will also replace the Spanish Colonel Real that has been in use up until this point."

 usa.347.t: "Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company closes New York banks"
 usa.347.d: "The Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company, founded in 1830, has now ceased operations in its New York City office. The company made investments in agriculture-related business, mostly to export to European countries due to their focus on military investment because of the Crimean War raging on. After the war was concluded, these European countries went back to producing crops and had no use of American imports. This led to the value of American foodstuffs decreasing. This, alongside rumors of embezzlement by employees and officers of the company, led to their offices in New York City closing."

 usa.348.t: "New York Banks stop gold withdrawals"
 usa.348.d: "Terrible news comes to the capitol today from New York City! After this year’s recent events, both the issues regarding the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company and the sinking of the SS Central America, banks have shut down the right to withdraw gold for fear of a gold shortage. New York, along with the rest of the country’s banks, have done this act, although much later than Philadelphia which stopped on September 26th.

With its establishment, instantaneous communications between East and West has become possible not only in theory, but in practice. With it, however, comes the news of the Pony Express' bankruptcy, with the company soon to be dissolved due to financial troubles, despite its popularity. On the bright side, many may now rejoice over near instant communication between East and West, finally removing the week to month long delays between messages."

 news_flavor.1.d: "Prison Hulks, or Prison Ships, have been used throughout the last 300 years as a way to transport prisoners across the ocean. The British are most famous for their transportation of prisoners to their different colonies throughout the world. During the Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars the use of Prison Hulks increased drastically throughout the world.

This new and strange method of transporation has garnered interest, first among Parisians and now all across Europe and even the USA. Despite it's crude and rough iron build, it remains an instant hit and trend among countries around the world, even being nicknamed the "Boneshaker"."

 news_flavor.4.t: "Climate Change?"
 news_flavor.4.d: "Earlier today, a lecture held by Physicist and Fellow of the Royal Society John Tyndall revealed several worrying and concerning properties of Coal Gas and Ether to be strongly absorptive of the sun's heat. In his lecture, Tyndall explained that \"when the heat is absorbed by the planet, it is so changed in quality that the rays emanating from the planet cannot get with the same freedom back into space. Thus the atmosphere admits of the entrance of solar heat; but checks its exit, and the result is a tendency to accumulate heat at the surface of the planet.\""
 news_flavor.4.a: "Concerning"
 news_flavor.5.t: "Hidden in Plain Sight!"
 news_flavor.5.d: "At the Paris Observatory in France this evening, renowned french astronomer Urbain Le Verrier announced the potential discovery of a new inter-mercurial object in the sky. The sighting of the planet was first recorded by french village doctor, turned astronomer hobbyist Edmond Modeste Lescarbault just months prior from his aged clinic. If these findings are to be verified, 'Vulcan' as some of fellow astronomers are calling, will be the second planet to not be discovered by sighting, but whose existence was predicted by Le Verrier's solar-gravitational models (Discrepancies between the motion of Uranus and the model had led to the discovery of Neptune a decade ago in 1854.) and will further professionialize the use of mathematical models to make discoveries in the celestial sky.\n \nWhile Le Verrier has been a proven standard of astrophysics in the last decade, many other astronomers are now describing this new discovery as proposterous at worse and faulty as best. An inter-mercurial object would have been discovered centuries if not millennia earlier, as any sizable object in this close proximity of the sun would have been recorded much sooner than now."

Townspeople claim that the water of the spring was suddenly clear and now the Catholic Church is rumored to be investigating these claims. \n\n Soubrirous describes the encounter happening as she and her sister were collecting firewood, only to see a strange woman resting in the nearby grotto. After a few nights of visiting the grotto the lady revealed herself to be the Virgin Mary, causing an uproar between the townspeople.

While many governments sent official delegates, the Austrian, French, and Russian Empires, the Kingdoms of Prussia and Italy, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland were notable inclusions and participants. \n \nAmong the many proposals made in the final resolution, the main points remain: neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers, the foundation of national relief for the wounded, and international humanitarian law to protect the lives and dignity of the victims of both international and internal armed conflicts. A significant advancement that connects many powers, the world waits to see what the organizer, Henry Dunant, has in store for them next..."

The escalation started June 15th this year on the disputed San Juan Islands between Vancouver Island and the state of Washington when a US citizen shot a pig on his land that belonged to his Irish neighbour, who worked for the British Hudson's Bay Company. It is reported that British authorities threatened to arrest the US citizen if he didn't pay the demanded compensation for the shot pig which caused other American settlers to demand military protection. When the commanding officer in the neighbouring Department of Oregon, U.S.A. dispatched soldiers to the San Juan Islands the British promptly replied by sending their own, which in turn prompted the Americans to send even more soldiers. By August 10th the situation had escalated so far that 461 US soldiers with 14 guns were facing of against 2140 British soldiers with five warships mounting 70 guns. Thankfully cooler heads in Washington D.C. and London, upon receiving news about the volatile situation have managed to negotiate an agreement allowing both sides to keep 100 soldiers each on the islands while the border dispute will be resolved by international arbitration.

 news_flavor.18.d: "A violent explosion has been reported from the wast Siberian forests of Russia!\n\nThe cold winds of Siberia turned unexpectedly to smoldering fire in a flash over the taiga of Tunguska some days ago. Strange eye-witness accounts from locals who saw the event state that the explosion was caused by a massive object falling from the skies at break-neck speeds, with a light so strong it dimmed the sun as it burned in its flight. The ensuing collision into the Tunguska taiga have reportedly flattened an area as great as 2,150 square kilometers, and an estimated 80 million trees. Despite the great power of the explosion, no impact crater or trace of the impact has been observed or found.\n\nThough the event has so far only claimed 3 lives, it has raised awareness of the question of meteor protection across the world and precautions are beginning to take place."

Sir Alfred Nobel had made his fortune in the steel and weapons manufacture industry with his company Bofors, and his will, read and confirmed in 1896, to make this foundation came as a great shock to both close family and to his former associates of the world.\n\nThe foundation, managed by Mr. Ragnar Sohlman and Mr. Rudolf Lilljenquist, are tasked with creating, reviewing and awarding candidates (called laureates) with one of five possible 'Nobel prizes' in different fields of science.\n\nThe possible prizes to receive are in medicine, physics, chemistry, physiology and literature.

However, the only flag we have for us is the Bonnie Blue, which was used by the Republic of West Florida and first adopted by the Confederacy with the admission of Mississippi into the Confederacy. However, blue just won't do. That's a Yankee color. So as we work to establish ourselves, we have called a referendum for our people to choose what banner we should take up."

 csa.23.d: "There are some Democrats who refused to join us in our fight for independence. The Northern Democrats, who were led by Stephen A. Douglas, betrayed our party. Now they claim to be the true Democratic Party. Naturally, we have far more Democratic Party support in the South, as many Nothern Democrats joined the Republican Party during the Election of 1860. But, there are some who have come up with an idea for a new party, the Dixiecrats. It signifies who we are, but adopting this name would mean that we give up the name and legacy of the Democratic Party to the traitors in the North."

Following Austria's victory over Sardinia-Piedmont, the contested territories were ceded to France in an attempt to bring more stability to the region, and to secure French support for the continued and intensified Austrian occupation of Northern Italy.

Critics of the diploma, of which there are many, deplore the new constitution. Both, the more centralist German liberals, as well as the non-German federalists, particularly those from Hungary, are unhappy with the reforms.

The resulting London Treaty of [GetYear] had been ratififed by most governments present, with the exception of the [FRA.GetName].\n\nThe French were angered with promises allegedly broken by the Prussian government, and demanded the desired and supposedly agreed upon compensation via an official ultimatum. [PRS.GetNameDef] has accepted this ultimatum to preserve peace with their western neighbours, thus, the Dutch selling of Luxembourg to France can be realized as intended."

 news.51.d: "\nBreaking news reaches us from the Ottoman Empire, indicating the discovery of the ancient and mythical city of Troy! It was until recently considered by many to be a legend and fictional, but excavations carried out by the German archeologist Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlik unearthed the secrets that the ground had held for centuries. Schliemann also found a sizable amount of jewelry, gold and artifacts, which he believes to be the so-called 'Priam's treasure', named after the Homeric King Priam. The most notable uncovered pieces of the treasure include weapons mostly made of copper, two gold diadems and other copper artifacts. Although the findings are yet to be confirmed, this discovery has the potential to change the way we teach and view the history of Greece and its mythology forever."
 news.51.a: "Wait, Troy really existed?"
 news.52.t: "Excavations at Mycenae - Mask of Agamemnon Found"
 news.52.d: "\nA major breakthrough at the archeological site of Mycenae, a hillside north of the valley of Argos, on the Greek peninsula of the Peloponnese, has been registered today: Heinrich Schliemann, the German archeologist that unearthed what are believed to be the remnants of Troy a few years ago, has discovered the Shaft Graves, a cemetery for the household of the Mycenaean royal family. Nineteen bodies have been uncovered in total: eight men, nine women, and two children, as well as the goods and weapons of the deceased that are present there. One of the most impressive artifacts found was a golden mask that Schliemann calls the 'Mask of Agamemnon', named after the legendary Mycenaean king Agamemnon, leader of the Achaeans in Homer's epic of the Trojan War, the 'Iliad'. These findings are yet to be confirmed for their historical value, but it surely seems like another spectacular succes for Schliemann."

The company has achieved a lot over the course its existence as a dye works and chemical plant, creating countless synthetic dyes and pioneering the first mass-produced synthetic indigo dye using the Heumann Synthesis. Through the tireless work of over 17 years of research and millions of marks of investment in the meantime, BASF is now able to sell massive amounts of indigo dye across the globe for a price far cheaper than ever. This, for now, concludes a staggering growth process since the company's foundation in 1865."

 news.54.d: "\nFollowing nearly three decades of debate after the political unification of Germany, the German language will finally have a unified spelling system. Thanks in large part to the continuing efforts of German linguists, teachers, and politicians, spearheaded by Dr. Konrad Duden, the Second Orthographical Conference had more success than its prequel 25 years ago. Over the last three days, 26 plenipotentiaries of the German states, Dr. Huemer as Austrian commissioner, and representatives of other institutions as well as the book trade met and discussed the standardization of a uniform German orthography in Berlin. In addition to state officials, a few experts took part, including Konrad Duden and Wilhelm Wilmanns, who had also already participated in the First Orthographical Conference in 1876. The resolution was accepted by both German and Austrian state officials, and, thus, is binding. It is also expected that [SWI.GetName] will join the resolution for German spelling shortly."

 news.101.t: "Gregor Mendel Presents his Laws of Heredity"
 news.101.d: "Today, Gregor Mendel, a humble monk and part-time scientist from Moravia, has published his biological studies on the genetics of selected plants after many years of research. Mendel's discoveries have the potential to be groundbreaking, formulating the laws of heredity themselves. It ultimately seems to come down to three separate, yet not independent laws: dominance, segregation, and independent assortment. If Mendel's discoveries and, thus, the three laws of heredity prove to be true, it might be possible to cultivate plants and breed animals much more effectively and according to very specific needs if the right pairs to match can be found. Though it seems like Mendel's publication is being ignored by the scientific community so far, it still managed to generate a few favourable reports in local newspapers. Only time will tell if his findings are confirmed."

 aus.1.d: "Due to our recent performance against the Italians and the growing threat of the Prussians, many of our top, high-ranking officials have requested that we consider reforming the army. Our economy is in a bad situation at the moment, which would make pouring money into the military look foolish to our subjects. It may be better to fund additional projects regarding the economy rather than this foolish nonsense!"
 aus.1.a: "Our standing army is fine!"
 aus.1.b: "I suppose we are in need of reform..."
 aus.2.t: "The Austrian Industry"
 aus.2.d: "The Austrian economy is not in the best of conditions. Most of the nation's good industry is packed inside the urban regions of Austria and Bohemia, such as Vienna and Prague. Nearly two-thirds of our population still make a living through subsistence agriculture, most of them Hungarian. If we expect to become a strong industrial nation in the future, it is of the utmost importance that we begin our attempts to spread industry empire-wide, even though we may be unsuccessful."
 aus.2.a: "It is our priority to provide for our people."
 aus.3.t: "Consulting Z.A.M.G."
 aus.3.d: "We have ambitions to open up plenty of new mines across the nation; however, it is best we consult scientists on the environmental impact of the new mining facilities. Hopefully, they will allow us to open the mines so that we are able to boost our economic output."

Some of our more cultured advisors wish to see additional heritage sites opened across Austria - and perhaps even in other corners of the empire. Doing so would likely raise the happiness and content of the empire, bringing stability and peace to our subjects. \n\nHowever, our other advisors see this as a threat to the country's industrialization efforts. Additional heritage sites would cause the industry to suffer to an extent, which could cause us to be unprepared in the next war, which they predict will be won based on who has the best technology and industry. \n\nThe final decision is now up to you, Kaiser."

 aus.9.d: "It is now the year 1857, and although nine years have passed since the Revolutions of 1848, the legacy of the uprisings still scar the empire. Discontent continues in the regions outside of Austria proper, causing many advisors to believe that the central government may be forced to give concessions to the provincial governments in order to prevent a repeat of 1848. With our former ally, Russia, no longer supporting us, it is of the utmost importance that the sentiment of revolution does not stir again, as the empire came close to collapse the last time it did. Oh, Kaiser Franz Josef! Lead the Austrian Empire to glory, unite its people, and bring justice to its enemies!"

 aus.10.t: "The Situation in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia"
 aus.10.d: "The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia and its inhabitants have brought the Austrian Empire nothing but trouble since 1848. The "Risorgimento" movement for Italian unification has been the worst of our worries regarding the Italian region. For centuries, the Italian peninsula has been split between many kingdoms and has been dominated by foreign powers, such as France or Austria. A unified Italian Kingdom would pose a large threat to current Austrian holdings in Northern Italy. Such a kingdom would also be a large threat to the continuation of the Austrian Empire, as it is highly unlikely that they will be willing to ally us.

 #Seven Weeks War

 sevenweekswar.1.d: "A storm is brewing over the German Confederation, and it seems it's only a matter of time before a military conflict erupts. [PRS.GetLeader] today got the chance to meet [FRA.GetLeader], while both were present at the beautiful French seaside resort town of Biarritz at the Bay of Biscay. Their meeting was rather discreet, but [PRS.GetLeader] made some vague innuendos to a possible Prussian concession regarding Luxembourg in the future. [FRA.GetLeader] cautiously responded with some remarks about the possibility of French neutrality in an inner German conflict involving the [PRS.GetName] and the [AUS.GetName] in return."
 sevenweekswar.1.a: "Sehr interessant..."
 sevenweekswar.2.t: "Signs of War"
 sevenweekswar.2.d: "Our constant quarrels with the Austrians in the German Confederation could be coming to a final close pretty soon. Both sides are tired of backing down or living with intolerable compromises and our government is determined to stop flinching from military conflict."

Both sides are tired of backing down or living with intolerable compromises and their governments are looking determined to stop flinching from military conflict."
 sevenweekswar.4.a: "We have to get ready."
 sevenweekswar.5.t: "Financial Preparations for War"
 sevenweekswar.5.d: "War has always been expensive, but the technological advances in warfare are increasing the costs of military conflict more than ever before. Since we can no longer ignore the signs of a clash with the [AUS.GetName], we need to prepare our war chest. This will surely involve budget cuts elsewhere."
 sevenweekswar.5.a: "So be it."
 sevenweekswar.6.t: "The Financial Crisis of [GetYear]"
 sevenweekswar.6.d: "Our debt is growing faster than our tax income can keep up with. Years of financial mismanagement and an underdeveloped industrial economy are finally taking their toll. We need to make drastic cuts to the budget and find a way to stimulate industrialization, if we want to remain a great power in economical respect, too."
 sevenweekswar.6.a: "Shocking..."
 sevenweekswar.7.t: "Partial Privatization of Railways?"
 sevenweekswar.7.d: "We need to bring in more money to finance the major conflict that is imminent. One rather effective way of doing so would be a partial privatization of railways that are of lower strategic importance to warfare. Although this would hurt our ability to expand the existing networks, we could use the additional income to mitigate the financial burden of a military conflict. Should we proceed with the sell-off?"
 sevenweekswar.7.a: "Yes, go ahead."
 sevenweekswar.7.b: "There's no need for this."
 sevenweekswar.8.t: "Austrian Maneuvers"
 sevenweekswar.8.d: "Despite our financial difficulties, we cannot back down to Prussia again. We will need to do something that asserts our presiding position in the German Confederation, and that also assures our friends in the Confederation that we still have what it takes to lead them. A show of strength close to the Prussian border might do the trick."

 sevenweekswar.10.t: "Prussian Army Preparations"

 sevenweekswar.10.a: "Zu Befehl!"
 sevenweekswar.11.t: "Alliance with Prussia?"
 sevenweekswar.11.d: "The Prussians have approached us with an alliance offer. They are close to going to war with the [AUS.GetName], as the German Confederation is about to break. We could certainly use this to our advantage and ask for a share of the spoils of war - if we are victorious. How should we respond?"
 sevenweekswar.11.a: "We will demand Venetia."
 sevenweekswar.11.b: "We will demand Venetia and Trentino."

 sevenweekswar.17.d: "[PRS.GetLeader] has just finished briefing the federal assembly in Frankfurt regarding the key elements of his plan to reform the German Confederation.

 sevenweekswar.18.a: "Interesting, nevertheless."
 sevenweekswar.19.t: "Support Austrian Socialists?"
 sevenweekswar.19.d: "We could try to support the Austrian socialists in a bid to infiltrate their political administration or, at the very least, cause some turmoil on the streets and in the factories of the big cities. This would be a risky move, though, since parts of the socialist movement are connected within the German Confederation. This could backfire and we might face similar socialist insurgencies, too."
 sevenweekswar.19.a: "Go ahead."
 sevenweekswar.19.b: "Not necessary."
 sevenweekswar.20.t: "Support Hungarian Separatists?"
 sevenweekswar.20.d: "The Hungarians, in the majority, are quite well-disposed towards us. We could use their hopes of participation or even liberation to our advantage. Should we try to support them in an attempt to destabilize the [AUS.GetName]?"

The culprit, a Jewish university student and convinced Republican from Baden by the name of Ferdinand Cohen-Blind, was overwhelmed and taken into custody by the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Guards, who luckily happened to be present on the side of the shooting. Bismarck himself was able to continue his walk home with minor bruises, although a more thorough medical examination will happen later today."
 sevenweekswar.21.a: "Glück gehabt."
 sevenweekswar.22.t: "Assassination Attempt on Bismarck"
 sevenweekswar.22.d: "News reaches us that the Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck has been shot on his way home from the Berlin Palace yesterday. The culprit, a Jewish university student and convinced Republican from Baden by the name of Ferdinand Cohen-Blind, was overwhelmed and taken into custody by the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Guards, who luckily happened to be present on the side of the shooting. Bismarck himself was able to continue his walk home with minor bruises, a more thorough examination revealed that the assassin's weapon was too weak to penetrate Bismarck's clothing and ribcage. Cohen-Blind committed suicide during the night."
 sevenweekswar.22.a: "Bismarck got lucky there..."
 sevenweekswar.23.t: "Parliament Dissolution"
 sevenweekswar.23.d: "The assassination attempt on Prime Minister Bismarck has once again proven that Republicans, Democrats and Liberals are a danger to our security. There is a war coming, and it's not very popular among the public. However, we will need stability and order now, thus, parliament will have to be dissolved to avoid political uproar during times of war. Maybe we can force a more favourable outcome this way, too."
 sevenweekswar.23.a: "So sei es."
 sevenweekswar.24.t: "Block Prussian Reform Plan"
 sevenweekswar.24.d: "We have been able to gather support to block the Prussian plan of reforming the German Confederation. Whilst this may not be the end of the Prussian proposal, it would surely put [PRS.GetLeader] under pressure to come forward with more acceptable terms."
 sevenweekswar.24.a: "Hervorragend!"
 sevenweekswar.25.t: "Austria Blocks Reform Plan"
 sevenweekswar.25.d: "The Austrian government has been able to gather support to block our plan of reforming the German Confederation.

Yesterday, the Austrian government asked the federal assembly of the German Confederation to take this matter into their hands and reach a decision.

 sevenweekswar.29.t: "Negotiate Secret Convention with France?"
 sevenweekswar.29.d: "War with the Prussians seems imminent, and we still hold possessions in Italy. The possibility of an Italo-Prussian alliance is not far-fetched, and the [FRA.GetName] might even support her friends in Italy, which would be disastrous. We could try to come to an agreement with the French though."

 sevenweekswar.30.t: "Austria Proposes Secret Convention"
 sevenweekswar.30.d: "The Austrian government has approached us with an inquiry to sign a military convention that would act as a non-aggression pact. They fear our involvement in support of the Italians in their imminent clash with the Prussians. We could ask them for something in return?"
 sevenweekswar.30.a: "The need to cede Venetia to the Italians, even in case of victory."
 sevenweekswar.30.b: "There will be no convention between France and Austria."
 AUS_FRA_convention_1866_1: "We will ask the §Y[AUS.GetName]§! to cede the North Italian region of §YVenetia§! to the §Y[ITA.GetName]§! in return for our neutrality in their imminent clash with the §Y[PRS.GetName]§!."
 sevenweekswar.31.t: "Occupation of Holstein?"
 sevenweekswar.31.d: "The Austrians have invoked the federal assembly of the German Confederation in our discord over the Schleswig-Holstein question. We cannot let Frankfurt make such far-reaching decisions concerning the stability and prosperity of the [PRS.GetName].

 sevenweekswar.32.a: "This can only mean war!"
 sevenweekswar.33.t: "Prussian Troops Occupy Holstein"
 sevenweekswar.33.d: "After the Austrians invoked the federal assembly of the German Confederation in the Schleswig-Holstein question, the [PRS.GetName] has ordered its army to seize and occupy Holstein, which has seemingly created a fait accompli for the Austrians."
 sevenweekswar.33.a: "How will they react?"
 sevenweekswar.34.t: "Suggest Austrian Exit from German Confederation"

 sevenweekswar.36.a: "Truely thrilling!"
 sevenweekswar.37.t: "File Motion for Federal Execution Against Prussia"
 sevenweekswar.37.d: "The renewed Prussian audacity leaves us with no other option but to seek military action. If we want to keep our presidency over the German Confederation, we need to act now. The unlawful Prussian occupation of Holstein gives us a very good reason to file a motion for federal execution against the [PRS.GetName] and most other member states will most likely support this course of action."

 sevenweekswar.40.t: "Sign Secret Austro-French Convention?"
 sevenweekswar.40.d: "The French have responded to our inquiry to sign a convention. They demand we cede Venetia to the Italians in return for their neutrality in our conflict with the Prussians. They also can't guarantee Italian neutrality. Although this is not what we had hoped for, it might be the only way to avoid defeat and to protect our friends in Southern Germany from French hegemony."

It appears that the French have high hopes for territorial expansion following their neutrality in the conflict. It seems they have set their eyes on acquiring our country.\n\nOur king, William III of the Netherlands, is in financial trouble and might jump at the opportunity. It's not in our hands, but we might soon have a new ruler..."

Now, although this would mean a loss of prestige, the grand duchy has been a nuisance at times and we are in deep financial trouble, so this sum of money could really help us overcome those problems.

The French are offering 5m guilders as compensation for the cession of all rights to the [LUX.GetName] and the Dutch King William III has agreed, pending our approval. It would not be entirely out of line to accept this transfer of territory, as [PRS.GetLeader] gave vague promises of compensation to [FRA.GetLeader], in case France would remain neutral in our struggle with Austria. But it would also mean extending our border with the [FRA.GetName] and giving up our fortress garrison in Luxembourg. What should we respond to the Dutch delegation?"

We could agree to their offer and end this war as victors, or we could reject these terms and continue the war in hopes for further gains in the Saarland or on the west bank of the Rhine.

France aspires their alleged natural border at the Rhine, and we will have to be prepared to meet their advances with even more determination.

 lux_crisis.34.d: "Despite the genuine peace offer from Prussia, the [FRA.GetName] has rejected to limit their expansion to Luxembourg, and the situation now seems to suggest that the French are aspiring a border on the Rhine. If they achieve their goal, it would mean a complete shift of power on the European continent, and future trouble and instability in the region would be inevitable.

If they agree, Luxembourg will remain under a personal union with the [HOL.GetName], and the German fortress there will stay under Prussian control. The Grand Duchy will also remain a part of the Zollverein, and we would pay some war reparations to the [PRS.GetName]."

 lux_crisis.37.d: "Our armies have been victorious so far against the [FRA.GetName], and the French government is offering us a peace deal. They offer the status quo ante in regard to Luxembourg, meaning that the Grand Duchy would remain under a personal union with the [HOL.GetName] and we could still control the fortress there. Luxembourg would also remain a member of the Zollverein. Additionally, the French are offering decent war reparations. We could agree to their offer and end this war as victors, or we could reject these terms and continue the war in hopes for further gains along the border. The latter would most probably make the other signatories of the London Treaty leave our side, they could even intervene on behalf of France if we are not careful.

 lux_crisis.38.t: "Prussia Rejects Our Peace Offer"
 lux_crisis.38.d: "[PRS.GetNameDef] has rejected our peace offer and decided to continue the war instead. They have finally dropped all pretense now, and their strategic aims are clear. Prussia aspires to gain territory along the border with Luxembourg and France, and we will have to be prepared to meet their advances with even more determination. Luckily for us, their refusal to accept our offer will probably convinve the London Treaty signatories currently on their side to withdraw from the war or maybe even intervene on our behalf."
 lux_crisis.38.a: "France has dealt with worse situations."
 lux_crisis.39.t: "Leave Prussia's Side?"
 lux_crisis.39.d: "Despite the genuine peace offer from France, the [PRS.GetName] has rejected to agree to the status quo ante regarding Luxembourg, and the situation now seems to suggest that the Prussians are looking for territorial gains on their western border. If they achieve their goal, it might well create a shift of power on the European continent, and future trouble and instability in the region would be likely. We need to think long and hard how we should proceed here. We might have supported the Prussians for too long already..."
 lux_crisis.39.a: "Leave them on their own."

 lux_crisis.40.t: "Prussia Accepts Our Peace Offer"
 lux_crisis.40.d: "[PRS.GetNameDef] has accepted our peace offer, Luxembourg will remain in a personal union with the [HOL.GetName]. The Grand Duchy will also remain part of the Zollverein following this agreement. We cannot deny it, this is a blow to our ambitions and to the cause of achieving our natural border at the Rhine, but we must overcome this setback, analyze the reasons for our failure, and look to improve in the future."
 lux_crisis.40.a: "Time to move on."
 lux_crisis.41.t: "Peace between France and Prussia"
 lux_crisis.41.d: "[PRS.GetNameDef] has accepted a peace offer from the [FRA.GetName], and they agree to get back to the status quo ante. Thus, Luxembourg will stay in a personal union under us and will also remain part of the Zollverein. Our involvement in this crisis has been far from fortunate, and it will take some time to recover our standing in the world."

 lux_crisis.42.d: "Our armed forces have been defeated. The French army has advanced deep into our territory and the west bank of the Rhine seems lost. We need to stop the bloodshed before it's too late. Giving in to France's demands will be devastating for us and the Prussian and German public, but we have no other choice at this point. Let's hope for the best, maybe the day for our revenge will eventually come."

The Prussian government has finally come to terms with reality, and they are now ready to accept our demands for territorial expansion along the Rhine. This is a glorious day for France, as our natural border at the Rhine has finally been reestablished, at least in part for now. Glory to France, glory to His Majesty, Emperor [FRA.GetLeader]!"

 lux_crisis.44.t: "France Occupies the West Bank of the Rhine"
 lux_crisis.44.d: "Our worst nightmare is a reality, the west bank of the Rhine has been lost to France. Once again, the both historically and economically vital German area left of the Rhine is now almost entirely under the control of French forces. The people there are going to suffer the consequences of our failures on the battlefield. The German public is fuming, but we can only hope to get an opportunity to strike back at some point."
 lux_crisis.44.a: "We need to take revenge..."
 lux_crisis.45.t: "Luxembourg Lost to France"
 lux_crisis.45.d: "Following our military defeat, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has been lost to France without any compensation. This marks the end of our rule over Luxembourg and a low point in our international standing and importance. The mistake had already occured when the topic was even allowed to enter the stage of international politics, and King William III will certainly have to justify his actions before an angry parliament."
 lux_crisis.45.a: "Damn..."
 lux_crisis.46.t: "Wallonia Lost to France"
 lux_crisis.46.d: "Following our military defeat, Wallonia has been lost to France without any compensation. Although culturally distinctively different from the western part of the country, the area has been a vital part of [BEL.GetName] since the successful revolution of 1830. This territorial loss not only reduces our population by around 40% and our geographic size by half, it also leaves us open to further expansion and a practical puppet of the [FRA.GetName] for the time being..."
 lux_crisis.46.a: "Damn..."
 lux_crisis.47.t: "Palatinate Lost to France"
 lux_crisis.47.d: "Following our military defeat, the Palatinate has been lost to France without any compensation. French forces now occupy the western bank of the Rhine, and it is unlikely that these German lands will be recovered any time soon. As for the Palatinate, it might have been a separate and distinctively different part of our realm, but it nonetheless was a vital component of the [BAV.GetName]. We will surely take time to recover from this, and the German public will be fuming at the loss of these German territories to France."

 lux_crisis.471.t: "Rhine Hesse Lost to France"
 lux_crisis.471.d: "Following our military defeat, Rhine Hesse has been lost to France without any compensation. French forces now occupy the western bank of the Rhine, and it is unlikely that these German lands will be recovered any time soon. As for Rhine Hesse, it might have been somewhat different in terms of cultural habits and religion from the rest of our realm, but it nonetheless was a vital component of the [HSD.GetName]. We will surely take time to recover from this, and the German public will be fuming at the loss of these German territories to France."
 lux_crisis.471.a: "We need to take revenge..."
 lux_crisis.48.t: "France Breaks the Balance of Power"
 lux_crisis.48.d: "Following its triumph over Prussia and their allies on the battlefield, the [FRA.GetName] now occupies large parts of the left bank of the Rhine. Their decisive victory means a dangerous shift of power on the European continent. France is now without a doubt the dominating power on the continent, and we need to do everything in our power to prevent a situation like that of the early 19th century from repeating. Otherwise we risk to be subdued by France sooner than later."
 lux_crisis.48.a: "The time to act is now."
 lux_crisis.49.t: "We Must Sue for Peace"
 lux_crisis.49.d: "Our armed forces have been defeated. The Prussian army has advanced deep into our territory and Alsace-Lorraine seems lost. We need to stop the bloodshed before it's too late.

The French government has finally come to terms with reality, and they are now ready to accept our demands for territorial expansion along the border in Alsace-Lorraine. This is a glorious day for Prussia and the German people, as the French menace that has been threatening the western parts of Germany for centuries seems averted for the time being. Glory to Prussia, glory to His Majesty the King, glory to the German people!"

 lux_crisis.51.t: "Prussia Occupies Alsace-Lorraine"
 lux_crisis.51.d: "Our ambition for expansion has been turned upside down, and Alsace-Lorraine has been lost to the [PRS.GetName]. After beating Austria and now us, Prussia looks destined to unite the German states and create a military and economic powerhouse in the heart of Europe. This inevitably puts us into a very difficult position, and we must do everything in our power to ensure we can recover eventually. For now, however, the French people of Alsace-Lorraine are going to suffer the consequences of our failures on the battlefield. The French public is fuming, but we can only hope to get an opportunity to strike back sometime in the future."

 lux_crisis.52.d: "Following their military victory over France, the [PRS.GetName] has agreed to purchase the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the same price we negotiated with the French. The Prussian leadership regards the situation that led to the war to be untenable for the future, and the German public demands that they take Luxembourg of our hands. We are in no position to decline their request. Whilst this is certainly not ideal, we could have been far worse off. This still marks the end of our rule over Luxembourg and a low point in our international standing and importance, and King William III will certainly have to justify his actions before an angry parliament."
 lux_crisis.52.a: "We might have gotten away with a slap on the wrist..."
 lux_crisis.53.t: "The Purchase of Luxembourg"
 lux_crisis.53.d: "Following our military victory over France, the German public demanded that we solve the Luxembourg question once and for all by acquiring it from the Netherlands. Our leadership has agreed to purchase the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg from King William III of the Netherlands for the same price that had originally been negotiated with the French, which amounts to 5m guilders. The situation that led to the war with France seems untenable for the future, and this solution will appease most other powers concerned. The Dutch have already agreed to the purchase and our forces will fully occupy the Grand Duchy within the day."
 lux_crisis.53.a: "A historical wrong has been righted."
 lux_crisis.54.t: "German Interests Defended"
 lux_crisis.54.d: "The French aggression has been met with force, the force of the German people. We have been victorious at the side of the [PRS.GetName] and our soldiers have fought bravely. The united effort to push back the French forces from German soil has also undoubtedly created a common spirit of national pride among our citizens, a spirit that is increasingly pushing for unification..."
 lux_crisis.54.a: "We will see."
 lux_crisis.55.t: "Prussia Occupies Alsace-Lorraine and Luxembourg"
 lux_crisis.55.d: "Following its triumph over France on the battlefield, the [PRS.GetName] has acquired Alsace-Lorraine and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Their decisive victory will certainly mean a shift of power on the European continent, and Prussia is now without a doubt a force to be reckoned with. Their strategic aim seems to be the unification of Germany, and we need to be wary of their ambition in the future."
 lux_crisis.55.a: "It's not an ideal situation, but there's not much we can do at this point."
 lux_crisis.56.t: "The Dutch Seek Prussian Approval"
 lux_crisis.56.d: "Our contacts in the Netherlands have informed us that King William III seeks Prussian approval before he agrees for the Luxembourg purchase to go through. Although the German Confederation no longer exists, and, thus, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is no part of it anymore, the Dutch monarch feels uncomfortable without green light from the new German hegemon. Since the emperor has recently spoken to [PRS.GetLeader], it is not unlikely that the Prussians will agree. If the German public gets wind of our purchase proposal, however, the deal is probably in danger."

The King still agrees to keep our end of the bargain, but should France decide to seek military confrontation over the matter, we will have to defend our interests on the battlefield.

The German public will also be delighted that German interests have been defended from French aggression. Regarding Luxembourg itself, our control over the Grand Duchy will surely be intensified, aiming for a possible future unification that would also extend our borders with Belgium and France."
 lux_crisis.63.a: "We have achieved a true victory!"
 lux_crisis.64.t: "France Rejects Our Peace Offer"
 lux_crisis.64.d: "[FRA.GetNameDef] rejects our renegotiated peace terms, which means that the war will continue. Since we have technically rejected the French peace offer first, our allies are likely to reconsider their involvement in the conflict with France. If we manage to advance further into France, however, we are in a good position to demand more than just control over Luxembourg, with or without foreign allies. Truly a chance worth taking."

 lux_crisis.65.t: "The War Continues"
 lux_crisis.65.d: "Following our rejection of the Prussian demand for controlling the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the war will continue.

 # Baltic events
 baltic.1.t: "The Lithuanian National Revival"
 baltic.1.d: "The Political Union of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland once created the largest and greatest European Superpower, the terror of the Ottoman and humbler of the Rus. But centuries of German and Russian imperialism and political meddling has erased the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth from the maps of Europe. But recent years has seen more and more Lithuanian Liberal Intellectuals seek political self-determination. Already they are reviving the common Lithuanian language, rehabilitating it for modern use. This kind of nationalism can only end one way."

 baltic.2.t: "The First Latvian National Awakening"

Now with his death, Morocco is up against new challenges in an age, where even their neighbours are being conquered by invaders from Europe."
