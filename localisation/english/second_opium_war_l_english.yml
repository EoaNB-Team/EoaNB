 # Events
 secondopiumwarnew.1.t: "Prepare to Attack Canton"
 secondopiumwarnew.1.d: "We are making the necessary preparations to assault Canton before we send our ultimatum that the British High Commissioner to China, Lord Elgin, will write to its viceroy Ye Mingchen. demanding that he implement in full the trade and access agreements made in the 1842 Treaty of Nanking that ended the First Opium War and that he pay reparations for British losses in the war so far.\n\nThe Qing Army is a massive force, although we have the technology, we must ensure that our expedition is not swarmed the moment we attack."
 secondopiumwarnew.1.a: "God Speed"
 secondopiumwarnew.2.t: "Join the British Against Qing?"
 secondopiumwarnew.2.d: "The British are making preparations to attack the Qing at Canton, they have previously tried to persuade us to join in a coalition against the Chinese. We have received complaints from our envoy in China, Baron Jean-Baptiste Louis Gros, over the execution of a French missionary, Father Auguste Chapdelaine, by Chinese local authorities in Guangxi province.\n\nHowever, many times we have suffered the death of missionaries for which no military vengeance occurred. So this will easily be spun as Imperialist gain.\n\nOn the other hand, the political situation wherein Britain's victory is inevitable and so it would only be wise to have a chance to gain the rewards also"
 secondopiumwarnew.2.a: "Oui!"
 secondopiumwarnew.2.b: "Not Worth the Men"
 secondopiumwarnew.3.t: "The French Propose a Coalition Againt China"
 secondopiumwarnew.3.d: "The French know we are preparing to attack China at Canton. While we have in the past offered the French to assist us in China, they refused. It must be clear to them that we are likely to win the Second Opium War and they wish to reap the rewards also. Forming this Coalition with the French would mean we don't have to commit as many of our own forces in the assault, freeing up much needed troops in India. It would also guarantee our success, if we were to win the war and not allow the French to help, they would be forever bitter…"
 secondopiumwarnew.3.a: "All Help is Welcome!"
 secondopiumwarnew.3.b: "Stay Away Frogs!"
 secondopiumwarnew.4.t: "British Send Ultimatum!"
 secondopiumwarnew.4.d: "The British had been permitted access to Canton (Guangzhou) at the end of the First Opium War under the terms of the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, but were being illegally barred from entry by its viceroy Ye Mingchen. In 1856, there had been a series of attacks on the Thirteen Factories and its residences, culminating with their complete destruction by fire. This and the seizure of a foreign ship led the British to assemble a force to demand reparations.\n\nthe British High Commissioner to China, Lord Elgin, wrote to Ye demanding that he implement in full the trade and access agreements made in the 1842 Treaty of Nanking that ended the First Opium War and that he pay reparations for British losses in the war so far. Elgin promised that if Ye agreed within ten days then British and French forces would cease offensive actions, though they would retain possession of key forts until a new peace treaty was signed."
 secondopiumwarnew.4.a: "Comply with Britain"
 secondopiumwarnew.4.b: "Never Barbarians!"
 secondopiumwarnew.5.t: "Treaty of Tianjin"
 secondopiumwarnew.5.d: "With the outbreak of the Second Opium War and an Anglo-French alliance banded against the Qing Empire, it is clear the Qing state cannot withstand the pressure of the West. The newly-ratified Treaty of Tianjin has forced the flow of commercial trade to continue throughout eleven ports across the Chinese coast, this time including the United States and Russia despite lack of combat. The Great Powers now watch closely with the intention of carving a slice out of the weakened Qing Empire."
 secondopiumwarnew.5.a: "Sign It..."
 secondopiumwarnew.6.t: "The Qing Refuse!"
 secondopiumwarnew.6.d: "Ye's reply was that Britain had effectively abandoned its rights with regards to Canton through eight years of inactivity, that the cause of the war (the loss of the merchant ship Arrow) had been of the British making and that he could not sign a new peace treaty because the 1842 treaty had been decreed by the emperor to last for 10,000 years. Elgin boarded HMS Furious on 17 December and sailed upriver towards Canton. On 21 December, Elgin ordered British Admiral Michael Seymour, French Admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly and British General Charles van Straubenzee to take Canton and handed over full operational control."
 secondopiumwarnew.6.a: "Onwards to Canton!"
 secondopiumwarnew.7.t: "European Forces Fail to Take Canton!"
 secondopiumwarnew.7.d: "After fierce fighting at Canton, the Qing army has narrowly defended the port city from European assault. The British have failed to take the city, with their forces retreating back to Hong Kong, while they won’t be pursued, this has greatly hurt the British Empire's image."
 secondopiumwarnew.7.a: "The Qing Beat the Odds!"
 secondopiumwarnew.8.t: "Continue Assisting in China?"
 secondopiumwarnew.8.d: "With our defeat in Canton, which was meant to be an easy victory, we must now contemplate whether we continue to commit our forces in China. The British have assured us this defeat will not be repeated and that they are committing more of their own forces. While this is reassuring, we can not lose another battle against the Qing or we risk being the laughing stock of Europe."
 secondopiumwarnew.8.a: "Oui!"
 secondopiumwarnew.8.b: "Not Worth the Men..."
 secondopiumwarnew.9.t: "France Leaves the Coalition!"
 secondopiumwarnew.9.d: "Unsurprisingly, after our defeat at Canton, the French have cowardly refused to commit any further forces in China and are pulling out. We must now decide whether we continue alone or follow the French in their decision. Continuing with the war could lead to greater success. However, if we choose to flee like the Frogs, it could lead to Hong Kong being attacked by the Chinese…"
 secondopiumwarnew.9.a: "We Shall Carry on the Fight"
 secondopiumwarnew.9.b: "We Shouldn't Risk It"
 secondopiumwarnew.10.t: "Britain Lose the Second Opium War!"
 secondopiumwarnew.10.d: "After a long drawn out war, the British Empire has deciede to end their expedition against the Qing Empire. The British forces have failed to take their objectives and have decided to not risk any further losses, with their forces retreating back to Hong Kong, while they won't be pursued, this has greatly hurt the British Empire's image. The future of the Britains interest in China and especially Hong Kong look uncertain."
 secondopiumwarnew.10.a: "The Qing Beat the Odds"
 secondopiumwarnew.11.t: "British Expedition take Canton!"
 secondopiumwarnew.11.d: "The main battle began with a naval bombardment throughout the day and night. The next day troops landed, taking a small fort, by Kupar Creek to the south-east of the city. The Chinese had thought that the attacking forces would try to capture Magazine Hill before they moved on the city walls, but on the morning after a naval bombardment ending at 9am European troops climbed the city walls with little resistance. They had arrived at the wall half an hour early and so faced fire from their own guns.\n\nOver 4,700 British and Indian troops scaled the city walls. The walls were occupied for a week, then the troops moved into the streets of the city that contained over 1,000,000 people. Commissioner Ye Mingchen was captured and taken to Calcutta."
 secondopiumwarnew.11.a: "Surprising?"
 secondopiumwarnew.12.t: "British Ships Spotted!"
 secondopiumwarnew.12.d: "Some of our Coastal Garrisons have spotted British ships sailing towards the Hai River in Tianjin. The Barbarian force seems much greater than the one encounted at Canton, we must build up more forces if we are to have any hope in repelling the attack!"
 secondopiumwarnew.12.a: "Prepare for Battle!"
 secondopiumwarnew.13.t: "European Forces Fail to Take the Taku Forts"
 secondopiumwarnew.13.d: "After fierce fighting at the Taku Forts, the Qing army has narrowly defended the forts from European assault. Even with a much larger force than at Canton the British have failed to take the forts, with their forces retreating back to Hong Kong, while they won't be pursued, this has greatly hurt the British Empire's image."
 secondopiumwarnew.13.a: "The Qing Beat the Odds!"
 secondopiumwarnew.14.t: "The Battle of Taku Forts"
 secondopiumwarnew.14.d: "The British Expedition sent a squadron of gunboats, under Rear-Admiral Admiral Michael Seymour, to attack China's Taku Forts. The battle ended as an allied success. The squadron bombarded the forts and left only nothing of use remaining. The Qing have no choice but to surrender to the Europeans and sign the treaty of Tianjin."
 secondopiumwarnew.14.a: "Peace at Last..."
 secondopiumwarnew.15.t: "Break the Treaty of Tianjin?"
 secondopiumwarnew.15.d: "Shortly after we signed the Treaty of Tianjin, the Qing imperial court agreed to the disadvantageous treaties, hawkish ministers prevailed upon the Xianfeng Emperor to resist Western encroachment. If we break the treaty it is almost certain we will risk clashing with the western nations once again. We can order the Mongol general Sengge Rinchen to guard the Taku Forts and Sengge Rinchen to reinforce the forts with additional artillery pieces.\n\nHowever, should we risk clashing with the technologically superior west? There is no certainty we will win…"
 secondopiumwarnew.15.a: "Follow the Treaty..."
 secondopiumwarnew.15.b: "Break the Treaty!"
 secondopiumwarnew.16.t: "Qing Break the Treaty of Tianjin!"
 secondopiumwarnew.16.d: "The Qing, with their attitude to being superior to outside nations, have broken the Treaty of Tianjin they signed with us. As a result, another expedition has been sent to enforce the treaty on the Qing. If they refuse, there will be further bloodshed… it is likely to be a British victory."
 secondopiumwarnew.16.a: "Here we go Again..."
 secondopiumwarnew.17.t: "Second and Third Battle of Taku Forts"
 secondopiumwarnew.17.d: "The Second Battle of Taku Forts took place. A British naval force with 2,200 troops and 21 ships, under the command of Admiral Sir James Hope, sailed north from Shanghai to Tianjin with newly appointed European envoys for the embassies in Beijing. British forces blew up the iron obstacles that the Chinese had placed in the Baihe River. The next day, the British forces sought to forcibly sail into the river, and shelled the Taku Forts. Low tide and soft mud prevented their landing, accurate fire from Sengge Rinchen's cannons sank four gunboats and severely damaged two others. American Commodore Josiah Tattnall III, although under orders to maintain neutrality, declared "blood is thicker than water", and provided covering fire to protect the British convoy's retreat.\n\nThe Third Battle of Taku Forts took place. London once more dispatched Lord Elgin with a force of 11,000 British troops under General James Hope Grant. They carried out a landing near Beitang some three kilometers (1.9 mi) from the Taku Forts, which they captured after three weeks.\n\nPeace talks between the West and China will soon begin... again."
 secondopiumwarnew.17.a: "Next Peking..."
 secondopiumwarnew.18.t: "Be Respectful During Peace Talks?"
 secondopiumwarnew.18.d: "We have won once again in China, with peace talks beginning in Beijing soon, we must decide on how to proceed during the talks. The Chinese view western nations as Barbarians, even though we have destroyed their army. Should we act like victors or continue to talk to the Chinese like our superiors? However, the Qing have a record of not responding well to “disrespect”... What's the worst that can happen?"
 secondopiumwarnew.18.a: "Don't Risk Offending Them..."
 secondopiumwarnew.18.b: "We are the Victors!"
 secondopiumwarnew.19.t: "Treaty of Tianjin"
 secondopiumwarnew.19.d: "With the outbreak of the Second Opium War and an Anglo-French alliance banded against the Qing Empire, it is clear the Qing state cannot withstand the pressure of the West. The newly-ratified Treaty of Tianjin has forced the flow of commercial trade to continue throughout eleven ports across the Chinese coast, this time including the United States and Russia despite lack of combat. The Great Powers now watch closely with the intention of carving a slice out of the weakened Qing Empire."
 secondopiumwarnew.19.a: "Sign It..."
 secondopiumwarnew.20.t: "The British Offends Our Emissary!"
 secondopiumwarnew.20.d: "The Xianfeng Emperor dispatched ministers for peace talks, but the British diplomatic envoy, Harry Parkes, insulted the imperial emissary during the talks. This surely can not stand, the Barbarians should not be allowed to insult their superiors like this. The British should be arrested and punished, teach these Barbarians some manners…"
 secondopiumwarnew.20.a: "No! Let it Slide!"
 secondopiumwarnew.20.b: "Arrest Him!"
 secondopiumwarnew.21.t: "Envoy Arrested!"
 secondopiumwarnew.21.d: "The Xianfeng Emperor dispatched ministers for peace talks, but the British diplomatic envoy, Harry Parkes, has been accused of insulting the imperial emissary during the talks. Word has arrived that Parkes was arrested in retaliation. Also captured were a number of British and French officers, Sikh soldiers, and a journalist from The Times. Parkes and the others were imprisoned, tortured, and interrogated. The prisoners had been tortured by having their limbs bound with rope until their flesh was lacerated and became infected with maggots, and by having dung and dirt forced down their throats. Several were executed by beheading, their corpses being fed to animals. Captured coolies who had worked for the allies were buried up to their necks and left to released rabid dogs.\n\nIt is clear the Qing are bitter about their defeat. However, if we leave our men to their fate, this will hit our prestige. Should we send another expedition to rescue the captives and finally put an end to this charade?"
 secondopiumwarnew.21.a: "It was his own fault..."
 secondopiumwarnew.21.b: "Demand their Release!"
 secondopiumwarnew.22.t: "British Send Ultimatum!"
 secondopiumwarnew.22.d: "After the British Envoy insulted the Imperial Emissary, we arrested him and a number of British officers. We have punished these Barbarians, as they deserve it. However, the British are demanding we release our Prisoners. If we do not, it is likely the West will send another expedition to force us to comply. Although it is possible for us to try and repulse a possible expedition, it will be no easy task.\n\nShould we release the prisoners or risk the wrath of the Barbarians?"
 secondopiumwarnew.22.a: "Release Them"
 secondopiumwarnew.22.b: "Never!"
 secondopiumwarnew.23.t: "Assault Peking!"
 secondopiumwarnew.23.d: "Unsurprisingly, the Qing have still not learned their lesson and refuse to accept our demands. As such, we have sent another expedition to force the Chinese to comply with our requests. We will force our way into Beijing if necessary."
 secondopiumwarnew.23.a: "Onwards!"
 secondopiumwarnew.24.t: "Battle of Zhangjiawan"
 secondopiumwarnew.24.d: "The combined Anglo-French force which had recently occupied Tianjin engaged our army numbering some 30,000-strong at Zhangjiawan. Since infantry was the worst part of the Qing army, the Qing commander-in-chief Sengge Rinchen decided to use his cavalry against the Anglo-French forces. British cavalry won a battle against Mongolian cavalry, French infantry crushed the defence of Chinese troops, and British-French artillery inflicted massive losses on the Chinese Qing army.\n\nShould we accept defeat or try and push the expedition to the sea? However, if we lose again we risk our army being devastated."
 secondopiumwarnew.24.a: "Surrender"
 secondopiumwarnew.24.b: "Carry on the Fight!"
 secondopiumwarnew.25.t: "Battle of Palikao"
 secondopiumwarnew.25.d: "The Anglo-French force had been trying for two years to get to Peking. The combined Anglo-French force marched in a leisurely manner from the Taku Forts, with the French on one side of the river, the British on the other.\n\nThe army advanced from Tianjin with a cavalry screen and when they reached Chang-Kia-Wan they met a large Chinese army with a five-mile front. There was a skirmish between cavalry, then with the allied artillery silencing the Chinese artillery. The Chinese army scattered and retired.\n\nTwo days later, the cavalry discovered the Chinese army in a strong position in front of a canal connecting Peking with the Peiho River, with two bridges at Palikao. The allied army attacked frontally and the cavalry attacked from the left forcing the Chinese back over the two bridges. The Anglo-French force inflicted massive losses on the Qing army trapped by the canal. Peking was invaded thereafter.\n\nOn the Qing side, Sengge Rinchen's troops, including elite Mongolian cavalry, were completely annihilated after several doomed frontal charges against concentrated firepower from the allied forces."
 secondopiumwarnew.25.a: "Devastating"
 secondopiumwarnew.26.t: "Burn the Summer Palace?"
 secondopiumwarnew.26.d: "After the release of Parkes and the surviving prisoners, the extent of their mistreatment became apparent. The destruction of the Forbidden City was discussed, as proposed by Lord Elgin to discourage the Qing Empire from using kidnapping as a bargaining tool, and to exact revenge on the mistreatment of their prisoners. However, an attack on Peking was ruled out, as this had already been presented as a threat for other terms.\n\nElgin also proposed burning the Summer Palace. In a letter, he explained that the burning of the palace was the punishment "which would fall, not on the people, who may be comparatively innocent, but exclusively on the Emperor, whose direct personal responsibility for the crime committed is established.\n\nShould we allow our forces to burn the palaces? "
 secondopiumwarnew.26.a: "No"
 secondopiumwarnew.26.b: "Burn it to the Ground!"
 secondopiumwarnew.27.t: "Summer Palace Looted and Burned Down"
 secondopiumwarnew.27.d: "After the European victories at the battles of Zhangjiawan and Palikao. British soldiers looted and burnt the Summer Palace, the French refusing to assist. The razing of the buildings took two days, with imperial property in the vicinity also destroyed. The British considered doing the same to the Forbidden City. However, decided against it, as burning of the Summer Palaces was the punishment which would fall, not on the people, who may be comparatively innocent, but exclusively on the Emperor, whose direct personal responsibility for the crime committed is established. This ensures the Qing come to the negotiating table and are unable to refuse the demands of the West."
 secondopiumwarnew.27.a: "Victory is Ours"
 secondopiumwarnew.28.t: "Emperor Flees Peking..."
 secondopiumwarnew.28.d: "With the Qing army devastated, the Xianfeng Emperor fled the capital and left behind his brother, Prince Gong, to take charge of peace negotiations. Xianfeng first fled to the Chengde Summer Palace and then to Rehe Province. This will likely upset much of the population, seeing the Emperor as a coward..."
 secondopiumwarnew.28.a: "Shameful"
 secondopiumwarnew.29.t: "Peking Convention"
 secondopiumwarnew.29.d: "While the emperor cowers far away from the capital, his brother will take his place in ratifying the previous treaty, with more being placed on the table to compensate for the sudden mutiny. Eleven trading ports have been opened for trade exclusively with the West.\n\nUnder Article 6, the Kowloon Peninsula, north of Hong Kong, was ceded perpetuity to Britain’s previously gained colony of Hong Kong. Further ratification of the Treaty of Aigun, which was signed in the same year as the Tianjin, resulted in further loss of territory, the province of Haishenwai was ceded to the Russians."
 secondopiumwarnew.29.a: "The War Ends..."
 secondopiumwarnew.30.t: "Russia Send Ultimatum!"
 secondopiumwarnew.30.d: "Since the reign of Catherine the Great, Russia has desired to become a naval power in the Pacific. It did so by annexing the Kamchatka Peninsula and establishing the naval outpost of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in 1740, as well as naval outposts in Russian America and near the Amur watershed, encouraging Russians to go there and settle, and slowly developing a strong military presence in the Amur region. The Qing Empire never governed that region effectively or conducted territorial surveys, and these Russian advances went unnoticed.\n\nGovernor-General of the Far East Nikolay Muraviev camped tens of thousands of troops on the borders of Mongolia and Manchuria, preparing to make legal Russian de facto control over the Amur from past settlement. Muraviev seized the opportunity when it was clear that we were losing the Second Opium War, and threatened us with a war on a second front if we did not accept the Russian demands."
 secondopiumwarnew.30.a: "Accept"
 secondopiumwarnew.30.b: "Refuse"
 secondopiumwarnew.31.t: "Treaty of Aigun"
 secondopiumwarnew.31.d: "After stationing tens of thousands of men along the Mongolian and Manchurian borders, the looming threat of a two-front invasion of the warring Qing Empire against the British and French has forced the Chinese to surrender. Diplomat Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky was sent to negotiate the terms of peace. The lands north of the Amur River have been under Qing control since the Nerchinsk Treaty of 1689 between the Tsardom of Russia and the Qing Dynasty. Under this new treaty, the borders have been redefined to give Russian control of the area north of the Amur River in Manchuria, the ancestral home of the Manchu people."
 secondopiumwarnew.31.a: "Sign"
 secondopiumwarnew.32.t: "Russia Fails to take Manchuria!"
 secondopiumwarnew.32.d: "After the Russian Ultimatum for Outer Manchuria was not accepted by Great Qing, the Russians would admit defeat, surrendering claims of the regions, and would also begin the demobilization process on the mongolian border, shortly before this a battle had occurred, between a force of Ten Thousand Russian soldiers, and Forty Thousand Qing Soldiers, with the Russians being heavily outnumbered, and forced to retreat."
 secondopiumwarnew.32.a: "The Qing Beat the Odds!"
 secondopiumwarnew.33.t: "Qing Refuse our Demands!"
 secondopiumwarnew.33.d: "Surprisingly, the Qing have denied our ultimatum, we will now send our troops into Outer Manchuria and force the Qing to accept our ultimatum, these Qing will never stand a chance in a 3 front war."
 secondopiumwarnew.33.a: "Onwards!"
 secondopiumwarnew.34.t: "Battle of the Taku Forts"
 secondopiumwarnew.34.d: "The Second Opium War rages strong and far off, away from American interests. A few years prior did we evacuate our citizens out of Canton, of which we were attacked and shelled. A treaty was signed after the conflict to enact complete neutrality during the war. However, naval commander Josiah Tattnall and his chartered steamship, Toey-Wan, has provided aid to the British and French landings at the attack on the Taku Forts along the Hai River in Tianjin, assisting by towing several loaded boats upstream into the raging battle. Despite breaking our terms of neutrality, Congress sees no cause for penance should be placed on Admiral Tattnall."
 secondopiumwarnew.34.a: "Interesting..."
 secondopiumwarnew.35.t: "Second and Third Battle of Taku Forts"
 secondopiumwarnew.35.d: "The Second Battle of Taku Forts took place.
