We hope that this and follow-up reform will end in making our armed forces one of the best in Europe."

AUS_found_kk_warministry: "Found K. und k. Ministry of War"
AUS_found_kk_warministry_desc: "We would establish a new shared army ministry, which will be a foundation for our new army structure.

There we will have a joint high command, with our emperor commander-in-chief, all centralised in Wien (Vienna)."

AUS_reorganize_landwehr: "Reorganise Landwehr"
AUS_reorganize_landwehr_desc: "We’ll reorganise the Landwehr, the territorial forces of the Ciseleithian part of our empire, into the K. und k. Landwehr.

This will be with Gemeinsame Armee (Common Army) and Honvéd as part of our land forces."

AUS_honvend_formation: "Honvéd Formation"
AUS_honvend_formation_desc: "One of Hungary’s demands in the Compromise of 1867 was to have its defence force. The Royal Hungarian Honvedseg will only operate in the Transleithania part of our empire. We’ll create their own Ministry, the K. u.

This will be with Gemeinsame Armee (Common Army) and Landwehr as part of our land forces."

AUS_reform_conscription: "Reform the Conscription"

AUS_HUN_expand_hussars_desc: "Hungarians and Poles have a long tradition of light cavalry. We could continue and support this tradition. This will be done by reforming and expanding hussars as swift recon units, which can strike enemies at any moment in the rage of battle."

AUS_ethnic_battalions: "Ethnic Battalions"
AUS_ethnic_battalions_desc: "In an empire of ten nationalities and five religions, marked by ethnic conflict and sharp political and economic divisions, the army formed the only real bond among the emperor's subjects and the sole instrument through which loyalty to him could find expression. We will only achieve this by creating ethnically homogeneous battalions."

AUS_mil_slavic: "Military Slavic"
AUS_mil_slavic_desc: "Military Slavic is a human-made group of cca 90 words, which means base military commands. It was made so every Slav of our empire could understand them even without learning them because of the proximity to each language."

AUS_ger_hun_commander_dominance: "Germano-Hungarian Commander Dominance"
AUS_ger_hun_commander_dominance_desc: "After Ausgleich, Hungarians will gain a much greater role in commanding our new reorganised army. Despite these changes, the official commanding language in our armed forces will still be German but with large Hungarian autonomy in the Honvéd part of the military."

AUS_multi_lan_army: "Multi-Language Army"
AUS_multi_lan_army_desc: "The biggest problem with the current structure of our army is that it has multiple nationalities trying to cooperate and fight in the name of the Kaiser. There are multiple ways to fix this huge problem like officers' language education, better division organisation etc. But the main point is that through our reforms, we are trying to fight internal misunderstanding."

AUS_HUN_study_our_lost_war: "Study Last Wars"
AUS_HUN_study_our_lost_war_desc: "We need to study the last wars on which experience we have to adapt our military thinking and doctrines. Only by teaching from our and others' mistakes will our army improve and not by endless hours sitting behind drawing boards."

AUS_HUN_archiduke_albert_conservative_army: "Archduke Albert's Conservative Reform"
AUS_HUN_archiduke_albert_conservative_army_desc: "We need to choose someone who will lead the reorganisation of our tactics. The best man for this job is Archduke Albert Habsburg, Duke of Teschen. He’s a defender of conservative tactics at all costs. He thinks that we need to reform our army but needs to be close to our long military traditions. All of the final major decisions regarding the army will be made by him and his associates."

AUS_HUN_modernize_stoss_taktic: "Modernize Stoß Tactic"
AUS_HUN_modernize_stoss_taktic_desc: "Stoßtaktik is a tactic preferred by our army in which our infantry fight in close quarters with bayonets against the enemy forces. We have shown the world it can be effective, but because of technological innovations, it is starting to be costly and obsolete. We need to learn from the past and rethink our Stoßtaktik and modernise it so it can match the power of the other armies."

AUS_HUN_adapt_napolenic_thoughts: "Adapt Napoleonic Thoughts"
AUS_HUN_adapt_napolenic_thoughts_desc: "Napoleon was one of the greatest strategists who many times defeated our glorious army. We still have much to learn from his military doctrines and tactics. If we want to remain a great power we’d have to adapt his thinking to the modern world."

AUS_HUN_functional_army: "Functional Army"
AUS_HUN_functional_army_desc: "If it works, why would we drastically change it? This can be also implemented in our armed forces. A functional army is what we need at the moment, and we cannot risk any risky experimentation with one of the foundations of our state."

AUS_HUN_Prince_Rudolf_Liberal_Reform: "Prince Rudolf's Progressive Reform"
AUS_HUN_Prince_Rudolf_Liberal_Reform_desc: "Prince Rudolf, the son of our great emperor, Franz Joseph I, is one of the most capable men to lead the army. He’s a true visionary. He’ll insist on progressive reforms in the land forces, which would drift our forces from any shameful defeat in any upcoming war. This will lead to modernising our failed army into a great, undefeatable one."

AUS_HUN_abolish_stoss_taktic: "Abolish Stoß Tactic"
AUS_HUN_abolish_stoss_taktic_desc: "Stoßtaktik is a tactic preferred by our army in which our infantry fight in close quarters with bayonets against the enemy forces. We have shown the world it can be effective, but with modern technology, it starts to be obsolete. We need to stop using this costly nonsense and start caring about our men's lives."

AUS_HUN_new_generation_new_tactics: "New Generation, New Ideas"
AUS_HUN_new_generation_new_tactics_desc: "We’ll fire most of our current military cabinet and fill the new positions with young and talented military theorists. This will lead to the development of new and modern tactics for our army, which will be used in a future war against anyone who dares to attack our great empire. Despite many old commanders’ opposition, we’ll progress our reforms in a way that our reforms will be relevant for many upcoming wars in the future."

AUS_HUN_modern_army: "Modern Army"
AUS_HUN_modern_army_desc: "The new and fresh cabinet will now work on modernising the Imperial and Royal Army’s equipment and tactics. We won’t ever face a shameful defeat anymore. Only with a modern army, we can stay a great power in global politics and defend our rightful place under the sun."

AUS_HUN_Status_of_Artilery: "Status of Artillery"
AUS_HUN_Status_of_Artilery_desc: "Artillery started to become the new king of the battlefield. We need to update our thinking to this unquestionable fact. Every modern army relies on the use of artillery and we would face hard times if we don’t adapt."

AUS_HUN_napoleonic_legacy: "Napoleonic Legacy"
AUS_HUN_napoleonic_legacy_desc: "During the Napoleonic wars artillery was used for the first time in European history on such a scale. We need to continue with this legacy and learn from our past mistakes."

AUS_HUN_en_masse_artilery: "En Masse Artillery"
AUS_HUN_en_masse_artilery_desc: "If we want to maximally use our artillery brigades, we’ll have to use as many artillery pieces at once. This tactic should maximalise our breakthrough in enemy lines."

AUS_HUN_fund_haubitzen_research: "Fund Haubitzen Research"
AUS_HUN_fund_haubitzen_research_desc: "The heavy artillery research lacked funds. We’ll spend some of the new and increased budget towards modernising the artillery technology. We’ll have to establish new research facilities and financially help existing ones."

AUS_HUN_form_reitende_artilleriedivision: "Form Reitende Artilleriedivision"
AUS_HUN_form_reitende_artilleriedivision_desc: "We’ll have to form a new artillery division. Reitende Artillerie Division would be formed by 10 mounted artillery batteries dragged by horses. This new mobile artillery will be a great support to our armed forces."

AUS_HUN_form_field_cannon_experts: "Field Cannon Experts"
AUS_HUN_form_field_cannon_experts_desc: "Artillery has a long tradition in Czech lands. It was used there from the Hussite wars in the 15th century. We need to support this legacy, which may bring us many potential victories on the battlefield. By our actions, we will create a new generation of artillery experts."

AUS_increase_army_budget: "Increase Army Budget"

AUS_contract_domestic_companies_mil: "Contracts with Domestic Military Companies"
AUS_contract_domestic_companies_mil_desc: "One of our main arms deliveries has to be from our lands. By this, we will not only ensure that deliveries would not be during war but also some form of national pride. We should try to contact domestic arms designers and sign contracts with them.

AUS_skoda_artilleries: "Škoda Artilleries"
AUS_skoda_artilleries_desc: "Škoda Works are on the way to becoming one of the biggest arms factories in the whole empire and even Europe. We need to improve their access to state arms contracts.

AUS_officer_appointment_noble_desc: "We think that our army should stick to the current officer appointment system. By this, we will ensure that the lowborn people won't infect the pureness of our officers corp.  The noble personnel, trained from their youngest years, were always the core of our army. We shouldn't move away from this tradition and protect it as much as is in our power."

## NATIONAL FOCUSES POLITICAL ##
AUS_the_political_landscape: "The Political Landscape"
AUS_the_political_landscape_desc: "After our uneasy partnership with the Kingdom of Hungary we should finally focus on our own problems. Such as the ever growing nationalism and the political rivalries that tear our Parliament, the Reichsrat away. As the dust have settled we can take the matters into our own hand and deal with every crisis that comes at us."

AUS_minority_question: "Minority Question"
AUS_minority_question_desc: "The Czech representatives are countinuing with the boycott. We can't allow Slavic nationalism and radicalism to grow, as it can have great consequences. Shall we seek minor concessions to coax them back into the fold, uphold the status quo to preserve German preeminence, or pursue a bold compromise that could reshape the empire itself? The future of Cisleithania may well hinge on how we answer the nationalities' call."

AUS_czech_minor_appeasement_for_czechs: "Minor Appeasement for the Czechs"
AUS_czech_minor_appeasement_for_czechs_desc: "Acknowledging the crisis does not mean surrendering to separatism and radicalism. By granting some sybolic and minor reforms to the protesters we could calm them just enough to buy us some time to focus on our other matters. Let this be a gesture of the Empire's goodwill, not its weakness."

AUS_cultural_and_ecducational_autonomy_for_czechia: "Give Them Cultural and Economic Autonomy"
AUS_cultural_and_ecducational_autonomy_for_czechia_desc: "By allowing the Czechs to teach their culture, and decide over their economic policies we will give them the illusion of free will, while still holding them close to us. If this is the path to end the protests once and for all we shouldn't be afraid to go down this path. But we will have to be cautious, because we can't risk angering our hard-liner friends in the party."

AUS_linguistic_rights_for_czechs: "Give Them More Linguistic Rights"
AUS_linguistic_rights_for_czechs_desc: "We can all agree that language is the soul of the nation. We shouldn't be the ones to deny the Czechs the right to freely use it. Doing this would cause less divide in the party, but some of the radical Czechs may not feel that this is a big enough favor for them."

AUS_czech_calm_down: "The Czechs Calm Down"
AUS_czech_calm_down_desc: "Trough carefully negotiating, while still remaining true to our party we have successfuly manage to calm down the Czechs. It seems that protests have stopped for now, but the leadership thinks that this is not the final time that we heard from the Czech radicalists!"

AUS_deny_the_czech_requests: "Deny Their Requests"
AUS_deny_the_czech_requests_desc: "We have managed their previous protests and boycotts and it's clear that we can surviive without them. We shouldn't give them rights, because that will only lead to our downfall. The Czechs have two options. Obey us or be silenced! We will give them the choice, but we won't force their hands."

AUS_avoid_radicalising_the_czechs: "Avoid Radicalising Them"
AUS_avoid_radicalising_the_czechs_desc: "The Czechs have chosen to obey our rule. As we have promised we will try to leave them be. But if they continue to revolt against us and boycott our government then we will use our tools to repress them."

AUS_the_boycotts_continue: "The Boycotts continue"
AUS_the_boycotts_continue_desc: "The Czech boycott persists, but it remains a distant issue for the empire as a whole. The crisis has yet to spiral into open conflict, and though the Czechs remain obstinate, the wider balance of power holds firm—at least for now. Stability, while fragile, endures."

AUS_use_the_police_to_silence_the_czechs: "Use the Police to Silence Them"
AUS_use_the_police_to_silence_the_czechs_desc: "The Czechs have chosen to fight on, but as we have promised we will also fight back! We will call in the police and we will silence the radicalist protesters. Resistance is futile and they have to learn this."

AUS_the_czech_riots: "The Czech Riots"
AUS_the_czech_riots: "What began as a boycott now threatens to destabilize the region entirely, as anger spills into open violence. The Czechs' resolve has hardened, and radicalism is growing. We must decide whether to continue down this path or risk further destabilization."

AUS_the_language_question: "The Language Question"
AUS_the_language_question_desc: "As national consciousness grows among the empire's many peoples, the eternal language question is getting bigger. The German-speaking elite insists that a unified Empire requires a unifided administration. But the Federalists argue that the supression of minority languages will just tear up our beautiful home.\n\nThe Reichsrat must now confront this sensitive question: will we forge unity through enforced uniformity, or through mutual respect?"

AUS_attempt_minor_changes: "Attempt Minor Changes"
AUS_attempt_minor_changes_desc: "We have seen that repressing the minorities only lead to future riots. Now that the previous government is ousted we can restart the process and reapproach the Czechs."

AUS_other_nationalities_want_rights_too_desc: "After we have given rights to the Czechs in Bohemia the other nationalities have stood up and are demanding their rights to be expanded too. The decision is now in our hands if we want to listen to them or stay away from their requests."

AUS_give_them_their_rights: "Give Them Their Rights!"
AUS_give_them_their_rights_desc: "We have made the decision to expand the minority rights to the other Crownlands. We hope that by working with them  we will be able to silence all the protests and boycotts."

AUS_enough_is_enough: "Enough Is Enough!"
AUS_enough_is_enough_desc: "We have got to draw the line somewhere! We can't toss out rights to everyone who comes at us. We won't become a puppet government controlled by all the minorities! We will fight with everything we have. We have to fight for our German friends and we have to fight for our great Empire!"

AUS_try_to_ignore_them: "Try To Ignore Them"
AUS_try_to_ignore_them_desc: "If we give into their demands what guarantees that they won't demand more? The Czechs have shown that their loyalty is only conditional. To preserve the authority of our government we should ignore their demands and focus on our own problems first."

AUS_avoid_radicalising_the_them: "Avoid Radicalising Them"
AUS_avoid_radicalising_the_them_desc: "While we won't compromise with the Czech leaders we still don't want to push them towards an open rebellion. By adopting measured responses we can contain the unrest and avoid radicalising the protesters."

AUS_the_boycotts_continues_taaffe_desc: "The Czech boycott persists, but it remains a distant issue for the empire as a whole.

AUS_use_the_police_to_silence_them: "Use The Police To Silence Them"
AUS_use_the_police_to_silence_them_desc: "The time for negotiation has passed. The Czech boycotts must end, and if the people refuse to comply, we will enforce order through any means necessary. The police will be mobilized to quash the unrest striking fear into the hearts of those who challenge the authority of the Empire. While this may provoke anger, it will send a clear message: the Empire will not tolerate defiance. The cost of peace may well be the silencing of dissent."

austria_hungary.306.d: "The Reichsrat is in a deadlock, as the Constitutionalist and Federalist representatives can't reach an agreement on the subject of Semi-Trialism. We could only pass the proposal with Imperial backing, but the Federalist government is not in a sweetspot with the Emperor.\nOnly time will tell if our government will survive or they will fade into obscurity."
austria_hungary.306.a: "Oh dear..."

austria_hungary.307.t: "Hard-lined Conservatives Are Angered"
austria_hungary.307.d: "Our attempt to make minor changes to the May Laws seemed to have backfired. Hardliner Conservatives from the party are starting to turn themselves away. If we want to gain back the unity of the Federalists, we need to give up our intentions of caution and appeasement, and attack the Liberal ideas."
austria_hungary.307.a: "They are not the ones in control"

austria_hungary.308.t: "The opposition is growing"
austria_hungary.308.d: "Our past decisions seemed to have angered the Reichsrat. Day by day the opposition is growing, and if we don't do anything about it our government will fumble. We could make deals with some of the minor parties, but that might not be enough to survive. Our best option is to steal the centralists, with promises for them."
austria_hungary.308.a: "The end is near"

austria_hungary.309.t: "Karl von Streymar Steps Down"
austria_hungary.309.d: "Only after 3 months in office, Karl von Streymar has resigned. His government lacked the parliamentary support needed for any reform. Because of the previous failures of the Liberal governments Emperor Franz Joseph would prefer a more conservative and multi-ethnic coalition in the form of the Federalists."
austria_hungary.309.a: "The end of an era"

austria_hungary.310.t: "The Path Ahead of Us"
austria_hungary.310.d: "The current Liberal government is opposed by most of the parliament, as the Minister-President, Ignaz von Plener is an open Liberal hardliner, refusing to cooperate with the opposition. Experts in the field of politics are speculating that his reign in office will not last for long."
austria_hungary.310.a: "We shall fight the opposition"

austria_hungary.311.t: "The Fellow Party Members Lose Their Trust"
austria_hungary.311.d: "Our decision to remain a hardliner, angreed even our own party members. If we continue to refuse any cooperation, Ignaz von Plener will be forced to resign."
austria_hungary.311.a: "We are doomed"

austria_hungary.312.t: "Ignaz von Plener Resigns"
austria_hungary.312.d: "After our faliures to cooperate we have lost the trust of the Reichsrat, we are forced to resign from office. Leopold Hasner von Artha has been selected as the successor of Plener. We can only hope that his government does better."
austria_hungary.312.a: "This is devistating for the country"

austria_hungary.313.t: "The May Laws"
austria_hungary.313.d: "We fear that if we were to put forward the original May Laws, we would lose the support of the Church and our catholic supporters. In order to circumvate this, while also curbing the power of the clergy, we are only focusing on one aspect of the original proposal. The choice is in our hands..."
austria_hungary.313.a: "Take the matters of marriage into our own hands"
austria_hungary.313.b: "Expand the Freedom of religion"
austria_hungary.313.c: "Take the eduction under our control"

austria_hungary.314.t: "The Path Ahead Of Us"
austria_hungary.314.d: "Eduard von Taaffe, the previous Defence Minister was chosen as the next Minister-President for Cisleithania. He was a good choice, as he is open to compromise with the other side, while also maintaining his loyality to the Constitutionalist party. He is at a crossroad of decisions, his choice could influence the future of politics."
austria_hungary.314.a: "Compromise will serve us well"

austria_hungary.315.t: "The situtation in our Industrial Heartland"
austria_hungary.315.d: "Bohemia is undineably an essential part of our Empire, with its industrial might. But in recent years Bohemian politicians have been boycotting our government to recieve more rights, and eventually becoming an independent part of the crown, just like Hungary. Fighting for their rights might get us a good ally."
austria_hungary.315.a: "We will do everything in our power"

austria_hungary.316.t: "Our stance on Czech rights"
austria_hungary.316.d: "Hohenwart doesn't want to risk a collapse of his government, so he decided to pursue a minor agreement with the Bohemian Crownland instead. Czechs have been complaining about Vienna not giving them enough autonomy in their education, but they have also protested the lack of language rights in administration and courts. We cannot give them both, so we are forced to choose of of the above."
austria_hungary.316.a: "Expand their Educational autonomy"
austria_hungary.316.b: "We should give them more language rights"

austria_hungary.317.t: "Ludwig Freiherr von Holzgethan Resigns From The Government"
austria_hungary.317.d: "Holzgethan was appointed after the resignation of Hohenwart, the Emperor intended him to be a transfer government until he can choose a better candidate. His reign was very shortlived, only lasting 27 days."
austria_hungary.317.a: "It was expected"

austria_hungary.318.t: "The Iron Ring Coalition?"
austria_hungary.318.d: "Eduard von Taaffe formed the Iron Ring Coalition as an answer to the Liberalist's germanophile coalitions, often excluding their own allies. With his coalition he has gathered enough support in the Reichsrat to pass any reform he wants. The Constitutionalists fear that Taaffe, who once was their ally, will stab them in the back and that he will cooperate with the Federalists, and even passing the Trialism issue."
austria_hungary.318.a: "The Liberals did nothing for us!"
austria_hungary.318.b: "We shouldn't backstab them!"

austria_hungary.319.t: "The Labourers are angered with our new Laws"
austria_hungary.319.d: "Taaffe and his coalition have passed countless labour laws in the Reichsrat, which have radicalised the labourers. They demand reparations for the damages done in their businesses by the government. They are threatening us with ceasing support of the Iron Ring coalition and withdrewing money from government funds. The decision is in our hands to decide what we want to do with the crisis."
austria_hungary.319.a: "We don't need their money!"

austria_hungary.320.t: "The Labourers Had Enough With The Government"
austria_hungary.320.d: "After our lack of action and reparations, the labourers have withdrewed from politics and have stopped supporting us. Even in the parliament we can see changes in the balance of power. If we don't do something about the situation, our government won't have the sufficient support to pass any reforms."
austria_hungary.320.a: "This isn't what we imagined to happen"

austria_hungary.321.t: "The liberals in our party have turned away"
austria_hungary.321.d: "After our decision to put an end to further election reforms, the liberals and centralists in our party have turned away from us, some even defecting to other parties. We can see that the Iron Ring Coalition is starting to break up."
austria_hungary.321.a: "We shouldn't have angered them"

austria_hungary.322.t: "Conservative Representatives Are Outraged"
austria_hungary.322.d: "We have successfully passed the second election reform, which has caused an uproar in the Reichsrat. The conservative representatives have organised a boycott, to see if they have the power to turn over the decision, but we will stop any attempts to stop the ratification of the reform. If it's necessary we will use legal actions against the said MPs."
austria_hungary.322.a: "We have lost some allies"

austria_hungary.323.t: "We have lost all support"
austria_hungary.323.d: "We have failed...\n\nOur allies have left us, the Coalition has been disbanded, and Taaffe is set to resign from office. The election reform has caused massive distrust in Taaffe and in members of the coalition. Our enemies are celebrating as we our governent has collapsed. Only God knows what the future holds for us, and the Empire."
austria_hungary.323.a: "What a shame..."

austria_hungary.375.t: "The Clergy Is Outraged"
austria_hungary.375.d: "The church is outraged as Adolf von Auersperg's government has decided to continue its party's policy of curbing the power of the clergy. Christian representatives are furious, and are demanding a veto on the proposal."
austria_hungary.375.a: "They have no power on us!"

austria_hungary.601.t: "New Military Districts and Reforms"
austria_hungary.601.d: "We have started our military reforms, and a crucial part of it is creating new military districts and reforming the current ones. They should be kept up to date with the current boundaries of the Empire, and we should base them on startegic importance rather than imperial compromises. This way we can ensure that our armed forces will be on the top in case of a military conflict"
austria_hungary.601.a: "We shall reorganise the Empire!"

austria_hungary.602.t: "History of Austro-Hungarian Military Maps"
austria_hungary.602.d: "Many of the military maps still in use today date back to before the 1848 revolutions, often riddled with outdated borders, inaccurate terrain data, and long-lost infrastructure. As the empire faces the realities of modern warfare, these obsolete maps pose a serious strategic liability. Reform and redrawing are not just desirable, but essential."
austria_hungary.602.a: "Interesting!"

austria_hungary.603.t: "Destroying City Fortresses"
austria_hungary.603.d: "Across the empire, the walls of once-proud city fortresses are being torn down. These massive stone defenses, built in the age of cannons and sieges, now stand as obsolete relics, hindering urban expansion and offering little value in the face of modern artillery and mass-mobilized armies.\n\nTheir demolition clears the way for broader boulevards, new barracks, rail lines, and the infrastructure of a modern state. Yet, as the dust settles, some mourn the loss of these old guardians of our cities—symbols of a time when war was waged with honor, and not machines."
austria_hungary.603.a: "They are reminders of the olden times"

austria_hungary.604.t: "Formation of Ethnic Batalions"
austria_hungary.604.d: "With our armed forces consisting of hundreds and hundreds of ethnicities it's getting obvious that this hinders our army's organisation. The high command made the decision to make purely ethnic batallions in order to have better cohesion between the divisions."
austria_hungary.604.a: "Is this helpful for the Army?"

austria_hungary.605.t: "Military Slavic"
austria_hungary.605.d: "As the empire's armed forces continue to draw recruits from across its diverse Slavic populations, a curious linguistic phenomenon has emerged: Military Slavic. This informal dialect, cobbled together from various South and West Slavic tongues with simplified grammar and vocabulary, is becoming a practical language among soldiers who share no common language.\n\nThough unrefined and unofficial, Military Slavic is proving surprisingly effective in the barracks and on the training fields, helping officers issue orders and fostering basic communication among Slavic troops. It's a reflection of both the Empire's fractured identity and its ability to improvise unity from diversity."
austria_hungary.605.a: "Interesting development"

austria_hungary.606.t: "Officer Appointment Question"
austria_hungary.606.d: "A growing number of reform-minded generals and ministers are questioning one of the oldest traditions of our armed forces: that officers must come from the nobility. With warfare becoming increasingly technical and merit-based, and with the need for a larger, more professional officer corps, some argue that talented commoners should be granted commissions."
austria_hungary.606.a: "We shouldn't stray from tradition"
austria_hungary.606.b: "Status doesn't matter, merrit does!"

austria_hungary.607.t: "Lessons from the Last War"
austria_hungary.607.d: "After our recent defeats we should think about making changes in our hig-command and in our army structure.\n\nThe conservative faction urges caution, preserving the chain of command, aristocratic officer traditions, and time-tested doctrines. To them, the defeat was a matter of discipline and morale, not structure.\n\nReformers, however, rally around the ideas of Crown Prince Rudolf, advocating for modernized training, centralized logistics, and an officer corps selected by merit, not birth. They argue that without such reforms, we will fall further behind the modern powers of Europe."
austria_hungary.607.a: "We should stick with the Conservative leadership"
austria_hungary.607.b: "We need  Rudolf's reforms"

austria_hungary.608.t: "Status of Artillery"
austria_hungary.608.d: "Recent military analyses and war reports have reinforced a simple truth: artillery is no longer just a support weapon, rather it is a defining force on the battlefield. The power of massed cannon fire, mobile field guns, and increasingly accurate bombardments have proven decisive in both offense and defense.\n\nSome in the General Staff argue that we must expand and modernize our artillery forces, invest in domestic production, and integrate heavy guns more thoroughly into our doctrine. Others still cling to the old view—that infantry courage and cavalry maneuvers win wars. The debate will shape the army's priorities for years to come."
austria_hungary.608.a: "Artillery is a defining weapon"

austria_hungary.901.t: "Cisleithanien Development"
austria_hungary.901.d: "The Austrian part of the Empire has long been prioritised by the leadership. It houses the industrial heart of our lands, Bohemia, one of the most advanced parts of the Empire. In the following years we plan to advance our industry, so that it can rival the giants, like the British behemoth.\n\nOne of the issues that we would need to solve is the vast gap between the standard of life in Galicia, and the other parts of the Empire.\nThe reforms will bring prosperity to all parts of our nation."
austria_hungary.901.a: "We will prosper!"

austria_hungary.902.t: "Industrialisation in Transleithania"
austria_hungary.902.d: "Transleithania has been long lagging behind the economy of Cisleithania. This is due to Imperial policy in the past, and the large focus on agriculture in Hungarian lands. To modernise our economy, we will need to have a sufficient transport system, and higher literacy rates.\n\nThe government plans to call in Industrial masterminds, like Ganz, Eötvös and Baross, who will help us industrialise Hungary!"
austria_hungary.902.a: "We need to industrialize!"

austria_hungary.903.t: "The Industrial History of Galicia"
austria_hungary.903.d: "Galicia has been experiencing injustice for centuries by the Habsburg crown. The region has been left behind long ago, and thus couldn't industrialise which has created a great proverty crisis in the region. We will work with Polish officials to fix, or atleast to improve the current situation in Galicia."
austria_hungary.903.a: "We have neglected them for long enough now"

austria_hungary.904.t: "Electrification of the Empire"
austria_hungary.904.d: "We have been falling behind, modern and industrialised societies, such as Britain, France or the USA, who has stared electrification in their nations. We will need to start the process before we are too late. To help us achive this ambitious goal, we will call in the minds of great scientists, who will help us plan out the electrification program for the Empire."
austria_hungary.904.a: "This is a big step towards modernization"

austria_hungary.905.t: "Křižík's Innovations"
austria_hungary.905.d: "František Křižík is an amazing innovator, who has helped us with our electrification project. His recent invention, the 'Plzen Lamp', has been a breakthrough in street-lighting. It is an automatic electric arc lamp, which can adjust it's light levels.\n\nHis previous inventions include the 'Křižík's cores', which can protect against the collision between trains.\nPeople all over the Empire are excited to see his latest invention."
austria_hungary.905.a: "His inventions will come in handy"

austria_hungary.906.t: "Breadbasket of the Empire"
austria_hungary.906.d: "Cisleithania has long been the breadbasket of the Empire, being the second largest exporter of flour. Our foodindustry keeps the Empire and its population alive, with its centre being in Budapest, the Capital of our great Kingdom. While we are planning to industrialise, we won't forget our past and we will continue to concentrate some of our efforts to improving our agricultural practices."
austria_hungary.906.a: "Agriculture is important!"

austria_hungary.907.t: "Continue in Ganz's Legacy"
austria_hungary.907.d: "Ábraháb Ganz was a leading force of Industrialisation in Hungary before the Ausgleich, and after his passing, his legacy went to his colleagues, András Mechwart, Antal Eichleter and Ulrik Keller. Mechwart has long been a follower of Ganz's modernizational ideas, and now he has established the Electrical Department of the Ganz Enterprises."
austria_hungary.907.a: "He was an economic genius"

austria_hungary.908.t: "Chamber of Commerce and Craft in Zagreb"
austria_hungary.908.d: "The Chambers of Commerce and Craft has been playing a vital role in modernization of Croatia during the last few decades. It was heavily involved in railway expansion, supporting lines that connected Zagreb to Budapest, Rijeka, and later Trieste.\n\nIt works to abolish outdated guild restrictions, integrating traditional crafts into a more modern, competitive framework. The Chamber also functiones as a forum where merchants and craftsmen could express grievances and lobby for favorable policies."
austria_hungary.908.a: "The Croatian Economy will boom"

austria_hungary.909.t: "Expand Our Education System"
austria_hungary.909.d: "While literacy rates are high in our developed regions, but in the periphery of the Empire, most of the population cannot read or write. If we want to thrive for a modern economy, we need a modern education system. We should work towards establishing a new grade and school system, and supporting more universities across the nation."
austria_hungary.909.a: "Our innovations will be world-renown"

austria_hungary.910.t: "Found New Universities Across The Empire"
austria_hungary.910.d: "The imperial government has the building of new, government funded universities across the bigger cities in the periphery. Whese institutions are expected to train not only scholars and jurists but also engineers, physicians, and teachers, strengthening both the state and civil society.\n\n While there are debates over the primary language of the said universities, it should still serve its purpose in increasing the literacy amongst all walks of life."
austria_hungary.910.a: "We shall educate our children"

austria_hungary.911.t: "New Technology High-Schools"
austria_hungary.911.d: "In response to the Empire's growing demand for skilled workers and engineers, several new technology-oriented high schools have been founded across Austria-Hungary.\n\nThe reform is widely praised by liberals and industrialists as a crucial step toward modernization and competitiveness, while conservatives remain wary of moving too far from traditional education models. Nonetheless, the schools represent a decisive investment in the Empire's future workforce and its place in the industrial age."
austria_hungary.911.a: "We need to keep up with the modern technology"

austria_hungary.913.t: "New School of Economics"
austria_hungary.913.d: "A new School of Economics has been founded within the Empire, dedicated to the study of commerce, finance, and modern economic theory. Its establishment reflects the growing need for trained specialists capable of guiding trade, industry, and state finances in an age of rapid modernization.\n\nSupporters see the school as an investment in rational economic management and a tool to strengthen the Empire's competitiveness, while critics fear it may empower new elites at the expense of traditional interests. Regardless, the institution marks another milestone in the Empire's educational and economic development."
austria_hungary.913.a: "A new generation of Economists will rise"

austria_hungary.914.t: "Found Austro-Hungarian State Bank"
austria_hungary.914.d: "The previous state bank established during the Austrian Empire has been made insignificant after the Ausgleich. After months of planning and working, the imperial authorities have established the Austro-Hungarian State Bank, a central institution tasked with regulating currency, overseeing credit, and ensuring financial stability throughout the empire. Modeled after leading European banks, it will hold the privilege of issuing banknotes and guiding monetary policy in the name of imperial unity."
austria_hungary.914.a: "We will keep our economy stable!"

austria_hungary.915.t: "Encourage Trade and Transport"
austria_hungary.915.d: "The government has announced a broad initiative to promote trade and improve transport links with our neighbours. Our first deals will be with the Serbian and Romanian government, who seem as great partners in trade, because of their richness in resources. Investments in new railway lines, river shipping, and road networks are expected to accelerate the flow of goods, reduce costs, and strengthen the Empire's internal and external markets."
austria_hungary.915.a: "Export everything!"

austria_hungary.916.t: "Baross's reforms"
austria_hungary.916.d: "Gábor Baross, our Transport Minister has announced major reforms, which would shift our obsolete and old-fashioned railway system into a modern and European one. He plans to introduce the 'zone tariff system'. By restructuring the railway freight tariff system, he would focus on the competitiveness of Hungarian agriculture and the interests of industry and trade, even at the expense of the profitability of the railways."

austria_hungary.917.t: "Eötvös's reforms"
austria_hungary.917.d: "Minister of Religion and Education Baron József Eötvös has unveiled a sweeping set of reforms aimed at modernizing the educational system of Transleithania.
