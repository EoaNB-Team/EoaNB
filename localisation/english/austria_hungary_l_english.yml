 AUS_dualism_in_army: "Dualism in the Army"
 AUS_dualism_in_army_desc: "As a new internal situation is forming in our lands, we need to adapt our armed forces to this situation. This will be done by negotiation with the Hungarian delegation.

 AUS_found_kk_warministry: "Found K. und k. Ministry of War"
 AUS_found_kk_warministry_desc: "We would establish a new shared army ministry, which will be a foundation for our new army structure.

There we will have a joint high command, with our emperor commander-in-chief, all centralised in Wien (Vienna)."

 AUS_reorganize_landwehr: "Reorganise Landwehr"
 AUS_reorganize_landwehr_desc: "We’ll reorganise the Landwehr, the territorial forces of the Ciseleithian part of our empire, into the K. und k. Landwehr. This will be another part of our armed forces. With it, we’ll establish the Ministry of National Defence (Landwehr Ministerium) in Wien (Vienna), independent from the K. und K. War Ministry. This will be with Gemeinsame Armee (Common Army) and Honvéd as part of our land forces."

 AUS_honvend_formation: "Honvéd Formation"
 AUS_honvend_formation_desc: "One of Hungary’s demands in the Compromise of 1867 was to have its defence force. The Royal Hungarian Honvedseg will only operate in the Transleithania part of our empire. We’ll create their own Ministry, the K. u. Honved Ministerium (The Royal Hungarian Defence Ministry), in Budapest independent from the K. und K. War Ministry. This will be with Gemeinsame Armee (Common Army) and Landwehr as part of our land forces."

 AUS_reform_conscription: "Reform the Conscription"
 AUS_reform_conscription_desc: "We need to reform and reorganise our antique conscription system. We will unite and simplify the whole system. All men between the age of 21 - 32 will need to go through 2-3 years of military service. Then they’ll have a 10-year reserve obligation."

 AUS_HUN_unit_elisation: "Unit Specialisation"

 AUS_HUN_elite_jeagers: "Elite Jäger"
 AUS_HUN_elite_jeagers_desc: "We will expand the elite Jaeger Division. These huntsmen and the foresters of our empire will become great scouts on rage of the battlefield."

 AUS_HUN_reform_heavy_cavalery: "Reform Heavy Cavalry"

 AUS_HUN_expand_hussars: "Expand Hussars Regiments"
 AUS_HUN_expand_hussars_desc: "Hungarians and Poles have a long tradition of light cavalry. We could continue and support this tradition. This will be done by reforming and expanding hussars as swift recon units, which can strike enemies at any moment in the rage of battle."

 AUS_ethnic_battalions: "Ethnic Battalions"
 AUS_ethnic_battalions_desc: "In an empire of ten nationalities and five religions, marked by ethnic conflict and sharp political and economic divisions, the army formed the only real bond among the emperor's subjects and the sole instrument through which loyalty to him could find expression. We will only achieve this by creating ethnically homogeneous battalions."

 AUS_mil_slavic: "Military Slavic"
 AUS_mil_slavic_desc: "Military Slavic is a human-made group of cca 90 words, which means base military commands. It was made so every Slav of our empire could understand them even without learning them because of the proximity to each language."

 AUS_ger_hun_commander_dominance_desc: "After Ausgleich, Hungarians will gain a much greater role in commanding our new reorganised army.

 AUS_multi_lan_army: "Multi-Language Army"
 AUS_multi_lan_army_desc: "The biggest problem with the current structure of our army is that it has multiple nationalities trying to cooperate and fight in the name of the Kaiser. There are multiple ways to fix this huge problem like officers' language education, better division organisation etc. But the main point is that through our reforms, we are trying to fight internal misunderstanding."

 AUS_HUN_study_our_lost_war: "Study Last Wars"
 AUS_HUN_study_our_lost_war_desc: "We need to study the last wars on which experience we have to adapt our military thinking and doctrines. Only by teaching from our and others' mistakes will our army improve and not by endless hours sitting behind drawing boards."

 AUS_HUN_archiduke_albert_conservative_army_desc: "We need to choose someone who will lead the reorganisation of our tactics. The best man for this job is Archduke Albert Habsburg, Duke of Teschen.

All of the final major decisions regarding the army will be made by him and his associates."

 AUS_HUN_modernize_stoss_taktic: "Modernize Stoß Tactic"
 AUS_HUN_modernize_stoss_taktic_desc: "Stoßtaktik is a tactic preferred by our army in which our infantry fight in close quarters with bayonets against the enemy forces.

We need to learn from the past and rethink our Stoßtaktik and modernise it so it can match the power of the other armies."

 AUS_HUN_adapt_napolenic_thoughts: "Adapt Napoleonic Thoughts"
 AUS_HUN_adapt_napolenic_thoughts_desc: "Napoleon was one of the greatest strategists who many times defeated our glorious army. We still have much to learn from his military doctrines and tactics. If we want to remain a great power we’d have to adapt his thinking to the modern world."

 AUS_HUN_functional_army: "Functional Army"
 AUS_HUN_functional_army_desc: "If it works, why would we drastically change it? This can be also implemented in our armed forces. A functional army is what we need at the moment, and we cannot risk any risky experimentation with one of the foundations of our state."

 AUS_HUN_Prince_Rudolf_Liberal_Reform: "Prince Rudolf's Progressive Reform"
 AUS_HUN_Prince_Rudolf_Liberal_Reform_desc: "Prince Rudolf, the son of our great emperor, Franz Joseph I, is one of the most capable men to lead the army. He’s a true visionary.

This will lead to modernising our failed army into a great, undefeatable one."

 AUS_HUN_abolish_stoss_taktic: "Abolish Stoß Tactic"
 AUS_HUN_abolish_stoss_taktic_desc: "Stoßtaktik is a tactic preferred by our army in which our infantry fight in close quarters with bayonets against the enemy forces.

 AUS_HUN_new_generation_new_tactics: "New Generation, New Ideas"
 AUS_HUN_new_generation_new_tactics_desc: "We’ll fire most of our current military cabinet and fill the new positions with young and talented military theorists. This will lead to the development of new and modern tactics for our army, which will be used in a future war against anyone who dares to attack our great empire. Despite many old commanders’ opposition, we’ll progress our reforms in a way that our reforms will be relevant for many upcoming wars in the future."

 AUS_HUN_modern_army: "Modern Army"
 AUS_HUN_modern_army_desc: "The new and fresh cabinet will now work on modernising the Imperial and Royal Army’s equipment and tactics. We won’t ever face a shameful defeat anymore. Only with a modern army, we can stay a great power in global politics and defend our rightful place under the sun."

 AUS_HUN_napoleonic_legacy: "Napoleonic Legacy"
 AUS_HUN_napoleonic_legacy_desc: "During the Napoleonic wars artillery was used for the first time in European history on such a scale. We need to continue with this legacy and learn from our past mistakes."

 AUS_HUN_en_masse_artilery: "En Masse Artillery"
 AUS_HUN_en_masse_artilery_desc: "If we want to maximally use our artillery brigades, we’ll have to use as many artillery pieces at once. This tactic should maximalise our breakthrough in enemy lines."

 AUS_HUN_fund_haubitzen_research: "Fund Haubitzen Research"
 AUS_HUN_fund_haubitzen_research_desc: "The heavy artillery research lacked funds. We’ll spend some of the new and increased budget towards modernising the artillery technology. We’ll have to establish new research facilities and financially help existing ones."

 AUS_HUN_form_reitende_artilleriedivision: "Form Reitende Artilleriedivision"

 AUS_HUN_form_field_cannon_experts_desc: "Artillery has a long tradition in Czech lands. It was used there from the Hussite wars in the 15th century.

 AUS_contract_domestic_companies_mil: "Contracts with Domestic Military Companies"
 AUS_contract_domestic_companies_mil_desc: "One of our main arms deliveries has to be from our lands. By this, we will not only ensure that deliveries would not be during war but also some form of national pride. We should try to contact domestic arms designers and sign contracts with them. Only by this, we will become an arms manufacturing powerhouse."

 AUS_skoda_artilleries: "Škoda Artilleries"
 AUS_skoda_artilleries_desc: "Škoda Works are on the way to becoming one of the biggest arms factories in the whole empire and even Europe. We need to improve their access to state arms contracts.

By this, we will ensure that the lowborn people won't infect the pureness of our officers corp.  The noble personnel, trained from their youngest years, were always the core of our army. We shouldn't move away from this tradition and protect it as much as is in our power."
