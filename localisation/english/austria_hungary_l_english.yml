	AUS_dualism_in_army: "Dualism in the Army"
	AUS_dualism_in_army_desc: "As a new internal situation is forming in our lands, we need to adapt our armed forces to this situation. This will be done by negotiation with the Hungarian delegation. We hope that this and follow-up reform will end in making our armed forces one of the best in Europe."

	AUS_found_kk_warministry: "Found K. und k. Ministry of War"
	AUS_found_kk_warministry_desc: "We would establish a new shared army ministry, which will be a foundation for our new army structure. The creation of the Kaiserlich und königlich Reichskriegsminister (Imperial and Royal Ministry of War) will mean we would have one ministry for both parts of our empire. There we will have a joint high command, with our emperor commander-in-chief, all centralised in Wien (Vienna)."

	AUS_reorganize_landwehr: "Reorganise Landwehr"
	AUS_reorganize_landwehr_desc: "We’ll reorganise the Landwehr, the territorial forces of the Ciseleithian part of our empire, into the K. und k. Landwehr. This will be another part of our armed forces. With it, we’ll establish the Ministry of National Defence (Landwehr Ministerium) in Wien (Vienna), independent from the K. und K. War Ministry. This will be with Gemeinsame Armee (Common Army) and Honvéd as part of our land forces."

	AUS_honvend_formation: "Honvéd Formation"
	AUS_honvend_formation_desc: "One of Hungary’s demands in the Compromise of 1867 was to have its defence force. The Royal Hungarian Honvedseg will only operate in the Transleithania part of our empire. We’ll create their own Ministry, the K. u. Honved Ministerium (The Royal Hungarian Defence Ministry), in Budapest independent from the K. und K. War Ministry. This will be with Gemeinsame Armee (Common Army) and Landwehr as part of our land forces."

	AUS_reform_conscription: "Reform the Conscription"
	AUS_reform_conscription_desc: "We need to reform and reorganise our antique conscription system. We will unite and simplify the whole system. All men between the age of 21 - 32 will need to go through 2-3 years of military service. Then they’ll have a 10-year reserve obligation."

	AUS_HUN_unit_elisation: "Unit Specialisation"
	AUS_HUN_unit_elisation_desc: "We need to train elite units, who can dominate the battlefields and win the wars for us. These units will have special training to reverse the unfavourable fate of wars to our advantage."

	AUS_HUN_alpine_mountainers: "Alpine Mountaineers"
	AUS_HUN_alpine_mountainers_desc: "In our land, there are many great mountains such as the Alps and the Carpathian. We can use this fact and recruit people from there to the elite mountaineers division, which could serve greatly to our army during a fight in mountainous regions."

	AUS_HUN_elite_jeagers: "Elite Jäger"
	AUS_HUN_elite_jeagers_desc: "We will expand the elite Jaeger Division. These huntsmen and the foresters of our empire will become great scouts on rage of the battlefield."

	AUS_HUN_reform_heavy_cavalery: "Reform Heavy Cavalry"
	AUS_HUN_reform_heavy_cavalery_desc: "Our heavy cavalry didn't change much from the Napoleonic war. We need to reform this truly outdated part of our military to bear the standards of modern military and warfare."

	AUS_HUN_expand_hussars: "Expand Hussars Regiments"
	AUS_HUN_expand_hussars_desc: "Hungarians and Poles have a long tradition of light cavalry. We could continue and support this tradition. This will be done by reforming and expanding hussars as swift recon units, which can strike enemies at any moment in the rage of battle."

	AUS_ethnic_battalions: "Ethnic Battalions"
	AUS_ethnic_battalions_desc: "In an empire of ten nationalities and five religions, marked by ethnic conflict and sharp political and economic divisions, the army formed the only real bond among the emperor's subjects and the sole instrument through which loyalty to him could find expression. We will only achieve this by creating ethnically homogeneous battalions."

	AUS_mil_slavic: "Military Slavic"
	AUS_mil_slavic_desc: "Military Slavic is a human-made group of cca 90 words, which means base military commands. It was made so every Slav of our empire could understand them even without learning them because of the proximity to each language."

	AUS_ger_hun_commander_dominance: "Germano-Hungarian Commander Dominance"
	AUS_ger_hun_commander_dominance_desc: "After Ausgleich, Hungarians will gain a much greater role in commanding our new reorganised army. Despite these changes, the official commanding language in our armed forces will still be German but with large Hungarian autonomy in the Honvéd part of the military."

	AUS_multi_lan_army: "Multi-Language Army"
	AUS_multi_lan_army_desc: "The biggest problem with the current structure of our army is that it has multiple nationalities trying to cooperate and fight in the name of the Kaiser. There are multiple ways to fix this huge problem like officers' language education, better division organisation etc. But the main point is that through our reforms, we are trying to fight internal misunderstanding."

	AUS_HUN_study_our_lost_war: "Study Last Wars"
	AUS_HUN_study_our_lost_war_desc: "We need to study the last wars on which experience we have to adapt our military thinking and doctrines. Only by teaching from our and others' mistakes will our army improve and not by endless hours sitting behind drawing boards."

	AUS_HUN_archiduke_albert_conservative_army: "Archduke Albert's Conservative Reform"
	AUS_HUN_archiduke_albert_conservative_army_desc: "We need to choose someone who will lead the reorganisation of our tactics. The best man for this job is Archduke Albert Habsburg, Duke of Teschen. He’s a defender of conservative tactics at all costs. He thinks that we need to reform our army but needs to be close to our long military traditions. All of the final major decisions regarding the army will be made by him and his associates."

	AUS_HUN_modernize_stoss_taktic: "Modernize Stoß Tactic"
	AUS_HUN_modernize_stoss_taktic_desc: "Stoßtaktik is a tactic preferred by our army in which our infantry fight in close quarters with bayonets against the enemy forces. We have shown the world it can be effective, but because of technological innovations, it is starting to be costly and obsolete. We need to learn from the past and rethink our Stoßtaktik and modernise it so it can match the power of the other armies."

	AUS_HUN_adapt_napolenic_thoughts: "Adapt Napoleonic Thoughts"
	AUS_HUN_adapt_napolenic_thoughts_desc: "Napoleon was one of the greatest strategists who many times defeated our glorious army. We still have much to learn from his military doctrines and tactics. If we want to remain a great power we’d have to adapt his thinking to the modern world."

	AUS_HUN_functional_army: "Functional Army"
	AUS_HUN_functional_army_desc: "If it works, why would we drastically change it? This can be also implemented in our armed forces. A functional army is what we need at the moment, and we cannot risk any risky experimentation with one of the foundations of our state."

	AUS_HUN_Prince_Rudolf_Liberal_Reform: "Prince Rudolf's Progressive Reform"
	AUS_HUN_Prince_Rudolf_Liberal_Reform_desc: "Prince Rudolf, the son of our great emperor, Franz Joseph I, is one of the most capable men to lead the army. He’s a true visionary. He’ll insist on progressive reforms in the land forces, which would drift our forces from any shameful defeat in any upcoming war. This will lead to modernising our failed army into a great, undefeatable one."

	AUS_HUN_abolish_stoss_taktic: "Abolish Stoß Tactic"
	AUS_HUN_abolish_stoss_taktic_desc: "Stoßtaktik is a tactic preferred by our army in which our infantry fight in close quarters with bayonets against the enemy forces. We have shown the world it can be effective, but with modern technology, it starts to be obsolete. We need to stop using this costly nonsense and start caring about our men's lives."

	AUS_HUN_new_generation_new_tactics: "New Generation, New Ideas"
	AUS_HUN_new_generation_new_tactics_desc: "We’ll fire most of our current military cabinet and fill the new positions with young and talented military theorists. This will lead to the development of new and modern tactics for our army, which will be used in a future war against anyone who dares to attack our great empire. Despite many old commanders’ opposition, we’ll progress our reforms in a way that our reforms will be relevant for many upcoming wars in the future."

	AUS_HUN_modern_army: "Modern Army"
	AUS_HUN_modern_army_desc: "The new and fresh cabinet will now work on modernising the Imperial and Royal Army’s equipment and tactics. We won’t ever face a shameful defeat anymore. Only with a modern army, we can stay a great power in global politics and defend our rightful place under the sun."

	AUS_HUN_Status_of_Artilery: "Status of Artillery"
	AUS_HUN_Status_of_Artilery_desc: "Artillery started to become the new king of the battlefield. We need to update our thinking to this unquestionable fact. Every modern army relies on the use of artillery and we would face hard times if we don’t adapt."

	AUS_HUN_napoleonic_legacy: "Napoleonic Legacy"
	AUS_HUN_napoleonic_legacy_desc: "During the Napoleonic wars artillery was used for the first time in European history on such a scale. We need to continue with this legacy and learn from our past mistakes."

	AUS_HUN_en_masse_artilery: "En Masse Artillery"
	AUS_HUN_en_masse_artilery_desc: "If we want to maximally use our artillery brigades, we’ll have to use as many artillery pieces at once. This tactic should maximalise our breakthrough in enemy lines."

	AUS_HUN_fund_haubitzen_research: "Fund Haubitzen Research"
	AUS_HUN_fund_haubitzen_research_desc: "The heavy artillery research lacked funds. We’ll spend some of the new and increased budget towards modernising the artillery technology. We’ll have to establish new research facilities and financially help existing ones."

	AUS_HUN_form_reitende_artilleriedivision: "Form Reitende Artilleriedivision"
	AUS_HUN_form_reitende_artilleriedivision_desc: "We’ll have to form a new artillery division. Reitende Artillerie Division would be formed by 10 mounted artillery batteries dragged by horses. This new mobile artillery will be a great support to our armed forces."

	AUS_HUN_form_field_cannon_experts: "Field Cannon Experts"
	AUS_HUN_form_field_cannon_experts_desc: "Artillery has a long tradition in Czech lands. It was used there from the Hussite wars in the 15th century. We need to support this legacy, which may bring us many potential victories on the battlefield. By our actions, we will create a new generation of artillery experts."

	AUS_increase_army_budget: "Increase Army Budget"
	AUS_increase_army_budget_desc: "Everything has its price. And so has a modern and ready army. We need to increase our army budget to be able to modernise and reform everything we need to."

	AUS_contract_domestic_companies_mil: "Contracts with Domestic Military Companies"
	AUS_contract_domestic_companies_mil_desc: "One of our main arms deliveries has to be from our lands. By this, we will not only ensure that deliveries would not be during war but also some form of national pride. We should try to contact domestic arms designers and sign contracts with them. Only by this, we will become an arms manufacturing powerhouse."

	AUS_skoda_artilleries: "Škoda Artilleries"
	AUS_skoda_artilleries_desc: "Škoda Works are on the way to becoming one of the biggest arms factories in the whole empire and even Europe. We need to improve their access to state arms contracts.

	AUS_officer_appointment_noble_desc: "We think that our army should stick to the current officer appointment system. By this, we will ensure that the lowborn people won't infect the pureness of our officers corp.  The noble personnel, trained from their youngest years, were always the core of our army. We shouldn't move away from this tradition and protect it as much as is in our power."

	## NATIONAL FOCUSES POLITICAL ##
	AUS_the_political_landscape: "The Political Landscape"
	AUS_the_political_landscape_desc: "After our uneasy partnership with the Kingdom of Hungary we should finally focus on our own problems. Such as the ever growing nationalism and the political rivalries that tear our Parliament, the Reichsrat away. As the dust have settled we can take the matters into our own hand and deal with every crisis that comes at us."

	AUS_minority_question: "Minority Question"
	AUS_minority_question_desc: "The Czech representatives are countinuing with the boycott. We can't allow Slavic nationalism and radicalism to grow, as it can have great consequences. Shall we seek minor concessions to coax them back into the fold, uphold the status quo to preserve German preeminence, or pursue a bold compromise that could reshape the empire itself? The future of Cisleithania may well hinge on how we answer the nationalities' call."

	AUS_czech_minor_appeasement_for_czechs: "Minor Appeasement for the Czechs"
	AUS_czech_minor_appeasement_for_czechs_desc: "Acknowledging the crisis does not mean surrendering to separatism and radicalism. By granting some sybolic and minor reforms to the protesters we could calm them just enough to buy us some time to focus on our other matters. Let this be a gesture of the Empire's goodwill, not its weakness."

	AUS_cultural_and_ecducational_autonomy_for_czechia: "Give Them Cultural and Economic Autonomy"
	AUS_cultural_and_ecducational_autonomy_for_czechia_desc: "By allowing the Czechs to teach their culture, and decide over their economic policies we will give them the illusion of free will, while still holding them close to us. If this is the path to end the protests once and for all we shouldn't be afraid to go down this path. But we will have to be cautious, because we can't risk angering our hard-liner friends in the party."

	AUS_linguistic_rights_for_czechs: "Give Them More Linguistic Rights"
	AUS_linguistic_rights_for_czechs_desc: "We can all agree that language is the soul of the nation. We shouldn't be the ones to deny the Czechs the right to freely use it. Doing this would cause less divide in the party, but some of the radical Czechs may not feel that this is a big enough favor for them."

	AUS_czech_calm_down: "The Czechs Calm Down"
	AUS_czech_calm_down_desc: "Trough carefully negotiating, while still remaining true to our party we have successfuly manage to calm down the Czechs. It seems that protests have stopped for now, but the leadership thinks that this is not the final time that we heard from the Czech radicalists!"

	AUS_deny_the_czech_requests: "Deny Their Requests"
	AUS_deny_the_czech_requests_desc: "We have managed their previous protests and boycotts and it's clear that we can surviive without them. We shouldn't give them rights, because that will only lead to our downfall. The Czechs have two options. Obey us or be silenced! We will give them the choice, but we won't force their hands."

	AUS_avoid_radicalising_the_czechs: "Avoid Radicalising Them"
	AUS_avoid_radicalising_the_czechs_desc: "The Czechs have chosen to obey our rule. As we have promised we will try to leave them be. But if they continue to revolt against us and boycott our government then we will use our tools to repress them."

	AUS_the_boycotts_continue: "The Boycotts continue"
	AUS_the_boycotts_continue_desc: "The Czech boycott persists, but it remains a distant issue for the empire as a whole. The crisis has yet to spiral into open conflict, and though the Czechs remain obstinate, the wider balance of power holds firm—at least for now. Stability, while fragile, endures."

	AUS_use_the_police_to_silence_the_czechs: "Use the Police to Silence Them"
	AUS_use_the_police_to_silence_the_czechs_desc: "The Czechs have chosen to fight on, but as we have promised we will also fight back! We will call in the police and we will silence the radicalist protesters. Resistance is futile and they have to learn this."

	AUS_the_czech_riots: "The Czech Riots"
	AUS_the_czech_riots: "What began as a boycott now threatens to destabilize the region entirely, as anger spills into open violence. The Czechs' resolve has hardened, and radicalism is growing. We must decide whether to continue down this path or risk further destabilization."

	AUS_the_language_question: "The Language Question"
	AUS_the_language_question_desc: "As national consciousness grows among the empire's many peoples, the eternal language question is getting bigger. The German-speaking elite insists that a unified Empire requires a unifided administration. But the Federalists argue that the supression of minority languages will just tear up our beautiful home.\n\nThe Reichsrat must now confront this sensitive question: will we forge unity through enforced uniformity, or through mutual respect?"

	AUS_attempt_minor_changes: "Attempt Minor Changes"
	AUS_attempt_minor_changes_desc: "We have seen that repressing the minorities only lead to future riots. Now that the previous government is ousted we can restart the process and reapproach the Czechs."

	AUS_other_nationalities_want_rights_too: "The Other Minorities Want Rights Too"
	AUS_other_nationalities_want_rights_too_desc: "After we have given rights to the Czechs in Bohemia the other nationalities have stood up and are demanding their rights to be expanded too. The decision is now in our hands if we want to listen to them or stay away from their requests."

	AUS_give_them_their_rights: "Give Them Their Rights!"
	AUS_give_them_their_rights_desc: "We have made the decision to expand the minority rights to the other Crownlands. We hope that by working with them  we will be able to silence all the protests and boycotts."

	AUS_enough_is_enough: "Enough Is Enough!"
	AUS_enough_is_enough_desc: "We have got to draw the line somewhere! We can't toss out rights to everyone who comes at us. We won't become a puppet government controlled by all the minorities! We will fight with everything we have. We have to fight for our German friends and we have to fight for our great Empire!"

	AUS_try_to_ignore_them: "Try To Ignore Them"
	AUS_try_to_ignore_them_desc: "If we give into their demands what guarantees that they won't demand more? The Czechs have shown that their loyalty is only conditional. To preserve the authority of our government we should ignore their demands and focus on our own problems first."

	AUS_avoid_radicalising_the_them: "Avoid Radicalising Them"
	AUS_avoid_radicalising_the_them_desc: "While we won't compromise with the Czech leaders we still don't want to push them towards an open rebellion. By adopting measured responses we can contain the unrest and avoid radicalising the protesters."

	AUS_the_boycotts_continues_taaffe_desc: "The Czech boycott persists, but it remains a distant issue for the empire as a whole. The crisis has yet to spiral into open conflict, and though the Czechs remain obstinate, the wider balance of power holds firm—at least for now. Stability, while fragile, endures."

	AUS_use_the_police_to_silence_them: "Use The Police To Silence Them"
	AUS_use_the_police_to_silence_them_desc: "The time for negotiation has passed. The Czech boycotts must end, and if the people refuse to comply, we will enforce order through any means necessary. The police will be mobilized to quash the unrest striking fear into the hearts of those who challenge the authority of the Empire.

	austria_hungary.301.d: "The newly established Dual Monarchy has shifted the balance of power within our Empire. With the Ausgleich of 1867, Cisleithania and Hungary now stand as separate entities under a shared throne, but the implications of this agreement are still unfolding. The people are divided, some view this as a step toward modernization and unity, while others fear the rise of nationalist movements that threaten the Empire's cohesion. The political landscape is shifting, and all eyes are now on Vienna to see how the new order will stabilize or further fracture our country."
	austria_hungary.301.a: "Interesting to see..."

	austria_hungary.302.t: "The December Constitution"
	austria_hungary.302.d: "The December Constitution of 1867 has finally been enacted, ushering in a new era of reform within Cisleithania. This landmark document lays the groundwork for a more structured and modern government, with the establishment of a constitutional framework that recognises the rights of all. The creation of the Recihsrat gives more power to the Minister-President, while the Emperor still holding great authority over the Empire's policies.\n\nWhile the reforms bring much-needed stability and a more representative government to Cisleithania, the system remains inherently complex and may not be enough to calm the rising tide of ethnic and nationalist unrest. With greater autonomy granted to the Hungarian side of the empire, many fear that similar demands will follow from other minorities within our borders."

	austria_hungary.303.t: "The Other Minorities Are Demanding Rights"
	austria_hungary.303.d: "Following to recent consessions given to Bohemia a wave of political agitation has spread across Cisleithania. Representatives from Galicia, Bukovina, Dalmatia, and other crown lands are now demanding similar cultural, linguistic, and administrative rights for their peoples.\n\nSupporters of further reform argue that granting these demands could foster a more unified and loyal empire through mutual respect. But conservatives warn that continued decentralization may lead to fragmentation, weakening the authority of Vienna and threatening the integrity of the monarchy itself.\n\nThe path forward is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the Emperor is watching."

They should be kept up to date with the current boundaries of the Empire, and we should base them on startegic importance rather than imperial compromises. This way we can ensure that our armed forces will be on the top in case of a military conflict"
	austria_hungary.601.a: "We shall reorganise the Empire!"

	austria_hungary.602.t: "History of Austro-Hungarian Military Maps"
	austria_hungary.602.d: "Many of the military maps still in use today date back to before the 1848 revolutions, often riddled with outdated borders, inaccurate terrain data, and long-lost infrastructure. As the empire faces the realities of modern warfare, these obsolete maps pose a serious strategic liability. Reform and redrawing are not just desirable, but essential."
	austria_hungary.602.a: "Interesting!"

	austria_hungary.603.t: "Destroying City Fortresses"
	austria_hungary.603.d: "Across the empire, the walls of once-proud city fortresses are being torn down. These massive stone defenses, built in the age of cannons and sieges, now stand as obsolete relics, hindering urban expansion and offering little value in the face of modern artillery and mass-mobilized armies.\n\nTheir demolition clears the way for broader boulevards, new barracks, rail lines, and the infrastructure of a modern state. Yet, as the dust settles, some mourn the loss of these old guardians of our cities—symbols of a time when war was waged with honor, and not machines."
	austria_hungary.603.a: "They are reminders of the olden times"

	austria_hungary.604.t: "Formation of Ethnic Batalions"
	austria_hungary.604.d: "With our armed forces consisting of hundreds and hundreds of ethnicities it's getting obvious that this hinders our army's organisation. The high command made the decision to make purely ethnic batallions in order to have better cohesion between the divisions."
	austria_hungary.604.a: "Is this helpful for the Army?"

	austria_hungary.605.t: "Military Slavic"
	austria_hungary.605.d: "As the empire's armed forces continue to draw recruits from across its diverse Slavic populations, a curious linguistic phenomenon has emerged: Military Slavic. This informal dialect, cobbled together from various South and West Slavic tongues with simplified grammar and vocabulary, is becoming a practical language among soldiers who share no common language.\n\nThough unrefined and unofficial, Military Slavic is proving surprisingly effective in the barracks and on the training fields, helping officers issue orders and fostering basic communication among Slavic troops. It's a reflection of both the Empire's fractured identity and its ability to improvise unity from diversity."
	austria_hungary.605.a: "Interesting development"

	austria_hungary.606.t: "Officer Appointment Question"
	austria_hungary.606.d: "A growing number of reform-minded generals and ministers are questioning one of the oldest traditions of our armed forces: that officers must come from the nobility. With warfare becoming increasingly technical and merit-based, and with the need for a larger, more professional officer corps, some argue that talented commoners should be granted commissions."
	austria_hungary.606.a: "We shouldn't stray from tradition"
	austria_hungary.606.b: "Status doesn't matter, merrit does!"

	austria_hungary.607.t: "Lessons from the Last War"
	austria_hungary.607.d: "After our recent defeats we should think about making changes in our hig-command and in our army structure.\n\nThe conservative faction urges caution, preserving the chain of command, aristocratic officer traditions, and time-tested doctrines. To them, the defeat was a matter of discipline and morale, not structure.\n\nReformers, however, rally around the ideas of Crown Prince Rudolf, advocating for modernized training, centralized logistics, and an officer corps selected by merit, not birth. They argue that without such reforms, we will fall further behind the modern powers of Europe."
	austria_hungary.607.a: "We should stick with the Conservative leadership"
	austria_hungary.607.b: "We need  Rudolf's reforms"

	austria_hungary.608.t: "Status of Artillery"
	austria_hungary.608.d: "Recent military analyses and war reports have reinforced a simple truth: artillery is no longer just a support weapon, rather it is a defining force on the battlefield. The power of massed cannon fire, mobile field guns, and increasingly accurate bombardments have proven decisive in both offense and defense.\n\nSome in the General Staff argue that we must expand and modernize our artillery forces, invest in domestic production, and integrate heavy guns more thoroughly into our doctrine. Others still cling to the old view—that infantry courage and cavalry maneuvers win wars. The debate will shape the army's priorities for years to come."
