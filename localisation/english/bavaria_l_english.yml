 ###Events###
 bavariafocus.0.t: "Maximilian II Dead!"
 bavariafocus.0.d: "Today, the realm is in mourning. For quite some time, our precious King Maximilian II had been suffering from severe illness. After months of battling disease, His Majesty fell very sick three days ago. Maximilian's body could no longer withstand the disease, and this morning he eventually succumbed to it. Maximilian II, being King of Bavaria for 16 years, died on 10th March 1864, ultimately leaving the throne empty. This event will certainly influence the very existence of our Kingdom."
 bavariafocus.0.a: "May the King rest in peace."
 bavariafocus.1.t: "Ludwig II Decides"
 bavariafocus.1.d: "As the oldest son of Maximilian II with a right to the throne, Ludwig II Otto Friedrich Wilhelm von Wittelsbach ascended at the age of just 18 years after his fathers death, and is now officially the new King of Bavaria. Seeing as how the young King could be or have been a subject of manipulation from a foreign state, many politicians are worried about how Ludwig could behave in the future. In an attempt to eliminate this risk, a proposal has been made by some of the worried, which would try to persuade the King. The proposal would try to bring Ludwig II closer to his fathers work, and maybe even push for the continuation of the Triaspolitik. However, a lot of people think that this would lead to no result, as Ludwig never was and probably still isn't interested in his fathers work and way of ruling. Whatever we decide to do, this will impact the future of the Kingdom of Bavaria greatly."

After she hesitantly entered the room no one aside from the dead Ludwig was in it anymore. His throat was pierced with a sharp knife or sword. The assassination and its real reason remain a mistery for now, but it is clear that the murder is connected to Maximilian's death and Ludwig's planned ascension of the throne."
 bavariafocus.3.a: "Everything went according to plan then."
 bavariafocus.4.t: "Luitpold von Bayern Takes the Throne!"
 bavariafocus.4.d: "After the death of Ludwig II and the following public commotion, Luitpold Karl Joseph Wilhelm von Bayern felt obligated on his own behalf to restore part of the stability lost due to the lack of a reigning monarch. As Otto I, Ludwig's younger brother and the next Prince to succeed the throne of their father, suffers archly from a mental illness, Luitpold has risen to act as Prince Regent of Bavaria until his sibling is considered adequate or a proper heir can be assorted."
 bavariafocus.4.a: "This might become a nuisance for us."
 bavariafocus.5.t: "Triaspolitik"
 bavariafocus.5.d: "The so-called Trias is a try of the southern German states to strengthen their bond and affront the great Germanic powers, being Prussia and Austria. The main contributors to this idea are Württemberg with Karl Augustus von Wangenheim, Bavaria with Maximilian II, the current King of Bavaria, and Prime Minister Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust from Hannover. This idea of a unified coalition in the south again experienced an upsurge in popularity after the German Revolution and is even being supported by France. Following the Prussian attempt at pulling through the Lesser Germany, the Four Kings Alliance became reality, consisting of Bavaria, Saxony, Hannover and Württemberg, which mainly supports the Greater Austrian Plan."
 bavariafocus.5.a: "Bavaria should be the one to lead the Trias."
 bavariafocus.6.t: "Bavarian Proposal"
 bavariafocus.6.d: "Bavaria today proposed to strengthen our bond and maybe even establish an alliance, seeing how the tension between Austria and Prussia keeps on growing. Accepting the Bavarian proposal may have its benefits, but many think that the old idea of the Trias, a try of the southern German states to strengthen their bond and affront the great Germanic powers, would lead to both Austria and Prussia being against us. We should decide carefully."
 bavariafocus.6.a: "We should accept Bavarias proposal. Let's grow stronger together."
 bavariafocus.6.b: "This proposal will be of no benefit to our nation. Deny it."
 bavariafocus.7.t: "Bavarian Proposal"
 bavariafocus.7.d: "Bavaria today proposed to strengthen the bond between our countries. While we did not make that much common policy in the past, Bavaria may be a good ally to have. If we were to accept, however, we must keep in mind that we would attract attention from both Prussia and Austria. Let us decide carefully."
 bavariafocus.7.a: "We should accept Bavarias proposal. Let's grow stronger together."
 bavariafocus.7.b: "This proposal will be of no benefit to our nation. Deny it."
 bavariafocus.8.t: "Bavaria Proposes a Süddeutscher Zollverein"
 bavariafocus.8.d: "As of late the relations between our country and Bavaria have been developing very well. We gained a few new allies, too, and now they proposed a new kind of Zollverein. Accepting this new South German Zollverein would mean getting rid of the old one and upsetting Prussia. Still, this proposal is not a bad move from Bavaria, wanting to exclude their enemies from the new Zollverein. In other words, Bavaria thinks of us as an ally."
 bavariafocus.8.a: "A brilliant idea! This will be of great benefit to our economy."
 bavariafocus.8.b: "This is just an attempt by Bavaria to grab more power. Don't let them succeed."
 bavariafocus.9.t: "Bavaria proposes the South German Confederation!"
 bavariafocus.9.d: "The South German Zollverein became reality and now Bavaria wants to push even further. The proposed South German Confederation is a military and economic alliance between allied German middle states. Accepting it means giving up on getting Prussia or Austria as allies and being on our own. There are two ways this could turn out - either the new South German Confederation is not supported by many middle states, marking its demise, or it becomes the Third Deutschland, the third big power in middle Europe. We do not like to gamble with the future with our country, but in this case it seems to be inevitable."
 bavariafocus.9.a: "Our country wants to be a part of this new Confederation. This will mark a new era."
 bavariafocus.9.b: "There is no way we will agree. It's suicide."
 bavariafocus.10.t: "Bavarian Protestantism Dead?"
 bavariafocus.10.d: "Catholicism is a part of Bavarian history and culture. Abolishing it would mean abolishing our culture, and no one wants that to happen. The Catholic Church will be a part of our country forever."
 bavariafocus.10.a: "This is for the best."
 bavariafocus.11.t: "Bavaria Accepts Protestantism"
 bavariafocus.11.d: "Today Bavaria lost a piece of its culture. The state officially recognized Protestantism, making it the state religion. Many are not content with this development, however, namely the 'classic' Catholic Church and conservative groups."
 bavariafocus.11.a: "Let us see how this will develop."
 bavariafocus.12.t: "Conservatives Resist!"
 bavariafocus.12.d: "Following our recent pro-Protestantism policies, a bunch of conservative Bavarian groups have been raising their voices. They demand that we stop 'destroying their beloved culture' and come back to old standards. Whatever we do, we should prepare for the backlash."
 bavariafocus.12.a: "Let them scream for a bit and eventually their cries will dampen. We're doing the right thing."
 bavariafocus.12.b: "Maybe we shouldn't be as aggressive. Let's do some talking first."
 bavariafocus.13.t: "Bavarian Protestantism Fails!"
 bavariafocus.13.d: "Our try to officially recognize Protestantism backfired. Many armed groups went on to strike and protest against our recent non-conservative moves. The Catholic Church prevailed and only widened its reach. All this effort - for nothing."
 bavariafocus.13.a: "Can't they see that they're destroying our country?!"
 bavariafocus.14.t: "Bavarian Protestantism Accepted!"
 bavariafocus.14.d: "No one believed this could happen - and yet it did. The conservative groups simply could not get the government to accept classic Catholicism again. Instead, Protestantism now plays a big role in the everyday-life of the Bavarian citizen. Still, the conservative groups refuse to give up on their beloved Catholic Church and the Bavarian people are now clearly divided."
 bavariafocus.14.a: "New times require new standards."
 bavariafocus.15.t: "Bavaria - A Friend?"
 bavariafocus.15.d: "Bavarian advisors and politicians today arrived in Vienna and proposed silent cooperation between Bavaria and Austria, as both of us have something against Prussia, to say the least. While it would make sense for them to ask us to become allies, maybe we should not meddle with the German middle states too much. On the other hand, with some political work, we could get a foothold in Bavaria, possibly making a battle against Prussia easier."
 bavariafocus.15.a: "The more allies on our side - the better."
 bavariafocus.15.b: "We don't need them."
 bavariafocus.16.t: "Bavaria - An Ally?"
 bavariafocus.16.d: "Yet again Bavarian advisors arrive in Vienna. This time their proposal is more drastic - seeing how Prussia keeps pushing their demands, Bavaria now wants us an official ally against them, feeling threatened by Prussia. This might be our chance to completely bring Bavaria on our side. However, this might incite the Prussians."
 bavariafocus.16.a: "If you think about it, Bavaria is not that different from Austria."
 bavariafocus.16.b: "We may have a common enemy, but we can manage alone."
 bavariafocus.17.t: "Talks With Austria Going Well"
 bavariafocus.17.d: "Today our advisors came back from Vienna with good news. Our proposals to Austria were accepted and the relationship between our two countries is steadily growing. While this is good news to us, Prussia should not be that happy about this development. We should tread with caution."
 bavariafocus.17.a: "This will help our relationship grow."
 bavariafocus.18.t: "Talks With Austria Continue to Go Well"
 bavariafocus.18.d: "And again our advisors come back, bringing good news with them. Austria now officially sees us as an ally after considering the pros and cons of this coalition. As long as our common enemy Prussia exists, this coalition will too."
 bavariafocus.18.a: "In these times allies are a must."
 bavariafocus.19.t: "Bavaria Wants to Support Bismarck's Parliament"
 bavariafocus.19.d: "Bismarck's proposal for a parliament seems to have found some popularity in Bavaria. This proposal is Bismarck's last try to bring the German middle states together and maybe with Bavaria agreeing to it it could succeed. Time will tell, but for now Bavaria seems to have become a little more open to Prussian politics. We could either accept their support, or reject it, the choice is still ours."
 bavariafocus.19.a: "It's not too late for them."
 bavariafocus.19.b: "They're just trying to kiss up to us."
 bavariafocus.20.t: "Prussia Accepts our Support!"
 bavariafocus.20.d: "Prussia just accepted our support for Bismarck's parliament. Maybe this will bring us a step closer to a German unification, or at least improve the relation between Bavaria and Prussia. Either way, this is good news, and we can stop holding our breath."
 bavariafocus.20.a: "Maybe we can avoid escalation after all."
 bavariafocus.21.t: "Bavaria Wants Unity"
 bavariafocus.21.d: "Bavaria once again wants to support our deed, and this time it is about German unity. Seeing how a war is probably inevitable, Bavaria wants to support us. While we do not think that Bavaria really wants to go to war, but only tries to gain some allies in case of it, they could be a good ally to have in the south. At the very least the Bavarian territory could be used as a temporary buffer between the German middle states and us."
 bavariafocus.21.a: "Very well, there shall be unity."
 bavariafocus.21.b: "Nothing but lies. We shouldn't trust them."
 bavariafocus.22.t: "Prussia Agrees!"
 bavariafocus.22.d: "After some wait, we have received message that Prussia agreed to our support. Now we have a strong ally on our side, but are right between the other German states and Austria, all of whom are strictly against Prussian reforms. Still, we now do not have to fear being alone in the case of war."
 bavariafocus.22.a: "Today is a good day."
 #(Austria)
 bavariafocus.23.t: "Military Consultative Commission"
 bavariafocus.23.d: "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results state that there is a high possibility of us surviving the upcoming war if we were to fight on Austrias side, as the latest developments have shown that Austria has a high enough political opinion of us to be our ally. Ultimately we did not learn anything we did not know before, seeing how Austria agreed to all of our proposals. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Austrias side."
 bavariafocus.23.a: "The commission is over."
 #(lean Austria)
 bavariafocus.24.d: "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were less clear than we had hoped them to be, stating that while Austria has its differences, it would probably be still a better idea to fight on their side instead of trying to survive alone. The Austrians agreed to most of our proposals, making an alliance in the case of war likely, but not definite. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Austrias side in case of war, but still be careful around them."
 #(Prussia)
 bavariafocus.25.d: "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were surprising, to say the least, with the commission recommending Prussia as an ally. Prussia and Bavaria are not the best friends per se and have their cultural and political differences, but recent developments have shown that the Prussians might not be as aggressive against Bavaria as we thought them to be. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Prussia's side."
 #(lean Prussia)
 bavariafocus.26.d: "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were slightly surprising, with the commission recommending Prussia as an ally in case of war. However, the commission pointed out that Prussia's main goal is to expand their reach, meaning one day they might turn against us. As such we should be very careful when joining an alliance with Prussia. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Prussias side, but still have an eye on their actions."
 #(neutral)
 bavariafocus.27.d: "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were disappointing at most, if anything. Instead of producing a clear statement, the commission could not find an agreement between its members. As such, not Prussia nor Austria seem to be good options in case of war. Maybe we should try to stay neutral, even if that seems unlikely at first."
 bavariafocus.28.t: "Bavarian Customs"
 bavariafocus.28.d: "Bavaria is a country of culture, arts and customs. With the new Republic established, however, we now have to ask ourselves if this can go on like this. We could try convincing our people to be more understanding towards other cultures and religions, and separate state and religion."
 bavariafocus.28.a: "Our customs and culture are important to our people."
 bavariafocus.28.b: "Maybe a change of pace would be good."
 bavariafocus.29.t: "Bavaria Decides"
 bavariafocus.29.d: "With two Kings gone in such a short time and new social ideas embraced, the government is in a turmoil. Now is our chance to form the future of our country, by taking the leashes in our own hands. Before we do any mistakes we will regret doing in the future though, we must first decide how to approach this. We could either try to take over the government from the inside, or call for a revolution."
 bavariafocus.29.a: "This is our chance to take over the government without any bloodshed."
 bavariafocus.29.b: "There is no way the nobles will give in. The only way is revolution."
 bavariafocus.30.t: "[From.GetName] Accepts!"
 bavariafocus.30.d: "[From.GetName] seemingly liked our proposal, and accepted it! Now we can move on and gather other allies. Together we are strong!"
 bavariafocus.30.a: "Great news!"
 bavariafocus.31.t: "[From.GetName] Denies!"
 bavariafocus.31.d: "To our regret, [From.GetName] denied our proposal. We should move on and try convincing others to join us."
 bavariafocus.31.a: "They don't understand how important this is."
 bavariafocus.32.t: "Nuremberg's Industrie- und Kulturverein Established!"
 bavariafocus.32.d: "As we have instructed, the Industrie- und Kulturverein in Nuremberg has been established. It will actively try to support and stimulate our industry and spread of our culture. Additionally it will help us gain more local influence in Nuremberg."
 bavariafocus.32.a: "Good to hear!"
 bavariafocus.33.t: "Bezirksamt Erlangen Established!"
 bavariafocus.33.d: "As we have instructed, the Bezirksamt Erlangen has been established. Because of how fast Erlangen, the small city in the proximity of Nuremberg has grown, the Bezirksamt makes sure that we as the Bavarian government have full control over the agrarian culture and industry in that area."
 bavariafocus.33.a: "Wunderbar!"
 bavariafocus.34.t: "The Culture of Munich"
 bavariafocus.34.d: "Since Ludwig I Munich has been the centre of Bavarian culture. The city is the main contributor to the Bavarian image and is our capital at the same time. As instructed by us, Bavarian culture will now go beyond Munich and reach even the smallest villages and towns of the [Root.GetName]."
 bavariafocus.34.a: "Ausgezeichnet!"
 bavariafocus.35.t: "The Pride of the Bavarians"
 bavariafocus.35.d: "Today [Root.GetLeader] made a speech, telling the people that they, as [From.GetAdjectiveCap]s, should be proud of themselves. The speech was received with loud clapping and the following night one could hear and see joyful singing, dancing and drinking everywhere. Ein Prosit auf Bayern!"
 bavariafocus.35.a: "We are a proud nation!"
 bavariafocus.36.t: "Bavaria Wants to Play Big"
 bavariafocus.36.d: "Today the Kingdom of Bavaria announced that from now on it wants to play a bigger role in the Concert of Europe, and find its place in it. Seeing how it is the biggest and most influential German middle state, some think that Bavaria's wish to be noticed by others could be successful, provided they take part in international politics, like the big powers do. Others, however, think that this wish is merely that, noting that the Kingdom of Bavaria never before had any interest in being a part of the Concert. While small countries like some other German middle states seemingly want Bavaria to succeed in becoming more important, the main and long-established powers in Europe, mainly France, Prussia and Austria, would like Bavaria to stay in its current position."
 bavariafocus.36.a: "Onwards, Bavaria!"
 bavariafocus.36.b: "This is merely wishful thinking."
 bavariafocus.37.t: "Bavaria Wants to Play Safe"
 bavariafocus.37.d: "For the current time, the Kingdom of Bavaria stated today that it will stay out of major European issues. While Bavaria wants to continue to play a role in German affairs, it does not want to get involved in any prominent foreign affairs. This choice, on the other hand, does not appear to have surprised anyone, especially given the size of the major powers that border the small kingdom, namely the Empire of France, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Austrian Empire. Bavaria, ostensibly unwilling to abandon its isolated policies and culture, prefers to concentrate on German regions rather than compete with neighboring powerhouses that surround it and its allies."
 bavariafocus.37.a: "We shall keep our principles."
 bavariafocus.37.b: "A wise decision."
 bavariafocus.38.t: "Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal Extended!"
 bavariafocus.38.d: "As we have instructed, the Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal has been extended. Finished in 1846 and built during the reign of Ludwig I, the Donau-Main-Kanal has been an important tool for Bavarian trade ever since. With the expansion finished, it now allows us to use more ships for trade, making Bavaria more important when it comes to trading."
 bavariafocus.38.a: "Ships sure are something."
 bavariafocus.39.t: "Ludwig-Süd-Nord-Bahn Extended!"
 bavariafocus.39.d: "As we have instructed, the Ludwig-Süd-Nord-Bahn has been extended. Named after Ludwig I, just like the Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal, it allows for fast transportation between Franconia and Upper Bavaria, even going so far to reach Saxony. After extending it with additional lines, it now grants us the possibility to transport our goods to more corners of Bavaria faster than ever before."
 bavariafocus.39.a: "Trains sure are something."
 bavariafocus.40.t: "Southgerman Confederation Formed!"
 bavariafocus.40.d: "It seems that the Triaspolitik of Bavaria and the other German middle states finally payed off. As of late, the middle states have been making common policy, guided by Bavaria, the biggest and most probably strongest middle state in the German area. Today, after endless discourses and debates, the Southgerman Confederation was born, officially lead by Bavaria. It is advertised by its members as the Third Deutschland, the third big Germanic power, right beside Austria and Prussia. However, it still remains a mystery whether this brand new alliance will bear any fruit and keep up with the European powers."
 bavariafocus.40.a: "We will be a power to be reckoned with."
 bavariafocus.40.b: "The Third Deutschland is now formed."
 bavariafocus.41.t: "[From.GetName] Joins the Southgerman Zollverein!"
 bavariafocus.41.d: "We just received word that [From.GetName] has joined the Southgerman Zollverein. As follows, they have abandoned the old one."
 bavariafocus.41.a: "This will benefit our economy greatly."
 bavariafocus.42.t: "[From.GetName] Denies the Southgerman Zollverein!"
 bavariafocus.42.d: "We just received word that [From.GetName] has refused our proposal. Seeing no future in the new Southgerman Zollverein, they decided to stick to the old one."
 bavariafocus.42.a: "What do they even gain from this decision!?"
 bavariafocus.43.t: "[From.GetName] Joins the Southgerman Confederation!"
 bavariafocus.43.d: "The [From.GetAdjectiveCap] government today told us that they will support our cause, agreeing to our proposal and that [From.GetName] will join the Southgerman Zollverein. They are now de jure a member."
 bavariafocus.43.a: "United we are strong!"
 bavariafocus.44.t: "[From.GetName] Denies the Southgerman Confederation!"
 bavariafocus.44.d: "After having considered the up- and downsides of our proposal, [From.GetName] decided to not join the new Southgerman Confederation. We will have to search for other members."
 bavariafocus.44.a: "After all this trouble we went through!?"
 bavariafocus.45.t: "[BAV.GetNameDef] Proposes the Establishment of the Trias"
 bavariafocus.45.d: "[BAV.GetName], our neighbour in the south of the German lands, lately has been motivating the middle states for the formation of the Trias, or the Third Deutschland, as some people call it. Essentially being a confederation or league of sorts, the Trias will establish a third power besides Prussia and Austria in the south. Liking this idea, [BAV.GetName] now officially proposed the formation of said Trias league. As such, both us and [BAD.GetNameDef] receive an invitation. If one of us declines, the Trias will break down, as it requires both [WUR.GetName] and [BAD.GetName] for its formation. When deciding on whether to accept or deny this proposal, however, we should keep in mind that becoming the third German power could have consequences."
 bavariafocus.45.a: "May this be the birthing hour of the Third Deutschland!"
 bavariafocus.45.b: "It is an old and unrealistic idea; fantasy."
 bavariafocus.48.d: "[BAV.GetName], our neighbour in the south of the German lands, lately has been motivating the middle states for the formation of the Trias, or the Third Deutschland, as some people call it. Essentially being a confederation or league of sorts, the Trias will establish a third power besides Prussia and Austria in the south. Liking this idea, [BAV.GetName] now officially proposed the formation of said Trias league. As such, we now receive this invitation, with [WUR.GetNameDef] already having accepted it. If we were to decline, the Trias would break down, as it requires both [WUR.GetName] and [BAD.GetName] for its formation. When deciding on whether to accept or deny this proposal, however, we should keep in mind that becoming the third German power could have consequences."
 bavariafocus.46.t: "Trias Established!"
 bavariafocus.46.d: "As both [WUR.GetNameDef] and [BAD.GetNameDef] have accepted our proposal regarding the formation of the Trias, we, the three south German states of the Trias, are now allied to each other. As this form of Trias has no leader per se, each and every member can voice their concerns and ambitions if they want to. However, to ensure the inner stability of this structure, [BAV.GetName] will act as a representative of the Trias."
 bavariafocus.46.a: "May the Third Deutschland flourish and thrive!"
 bavariafocus.49.t: "[WUR.GetName] Accepts!"
 bavariafocus.49.d: "Word reached us that [WUR.GetNameDef] has accepted our proposal regarding the Trias. Now, it is up to [BAD.GetNameDef] to decide whether the Trias will be established or not."
 bavariafocus.49.a: "We welcome our [WUR.GetAdjective] friends!"
 bavariafocus.47.t: "[FROM.GetName] Denies!"
 bavariafocus.47.d: "As [FROM.GetNameDef] has denied our proposal regarding the Trias, no such structure can be formed anymore from our side as such requires both [WUR.GetName] and [BAD.GetName] to accept. Unfortunately for us, and for all of the southern German states wishing for a Third Deutschland, there is nothing we can do anymore to ensure the sovereignty of the middle states, including ourselves."
 bavariafocus.47.a: "The dream of the Trias - shattered into a thousand pieces..."
 bavariafocus.50.t: "Invitation to the Trias"
 bavariafocus.50.d: "With the Trias established in the South, [BAV.GetNameDef] asks us whether we would like to join it or not. The three founding nations of the Trias, namely [BAV.GetName], [WUR.GetName] and [BAD.GetName], now are on the lookout for more allies, as the Trias is still quite small as it is right now. By deciding to join them we may be able to participate in creating the Third Deutschland, although it must be said that doing so may also have consequences."
 bavariafocus.50.a: "The Third Deutschland, we shall be a part of it!"
 bavariafocus.50.b: "We do not want to aggravate the political situation Central Europe is already in."
 bavariafocus.51.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts!"
 bavariafocus.51.d: "Following our invitation into the Trias, [FROM.GetNameDef] decided that being a part of the newly formed Trias would benefit them in the long run."
 bavariafocus.51.a: "Welcome to the Third Deutschland!"
 bavariafocus.52.t: "[FROM.GetName] Denies!"
 bavariafocus.52.d: "Following our invitation into the Trias, [FROM.GetNameDef] decided that they would rather stay away from the newly formed Trias."
 bavariafocus.52.a: "Curse those damn [FROM.GetAdjective]s!"

 bavariaevent.0.t: "Maximilian II Tries to Push for Reforms"
 bavariaevent.0.d: "The Bavarian King Maximilian II has today suggested withdrawing the freedom of the press and suffrage. Remembering the German Revolution of 1848 and 1849, the King thinks that there should be stricter laws to prevent a return of such a movement. However, multiple advisors and politicians are unsure if that really is such a good idea. Many are concerned that such reforms could incite the people, making the situation only worse. Whether these suggested reforms will be implemented or not is still up in the air."
 bavariaevent.0.a: "We will follow the King's will."
 bavariaevent.1.t: "Frankfurter Fürstentag"
 bavariaevent.1.d: "The Frankfurter Fürstentag session began today on the 17th August 1863. The Fürstentag was initiated by the Austrian Kaiser and deals with proposed reforms regarding the German Confederation. The proposed reforms, if enacted, would inter alia set up a parliamentary committee, bringing the German Confederation nearer to being a Federal State. On the other hand, Prussia proposed other plans for the reorganization of the German Confederation. We either could support the Austrian proposals, disapprove of them and support the Prussian ones or stay neutral."
 bavariaevent.1.a: "We will support the Austrian proposals."
 bavariaevent.1.b: "We don't want to incite anybody."
 bavariaevent.1.c: "We will support the Prussia proposals."
 bavariaevent.2.t: "King Max's Hike"
 bavariaevent.2.d: "Maximilian II today hiked in the Alpine region in Upper Bavaria. The total length of the path amounts up to 26 km and stretches from the Hörnle summit by Bad Kohlgrub, the royal Jagdhaus on the Pürschling and the Klammspitze summit to the Brunnenkopfhäuser built by King Max himself."
 bavariaevent.2.a: "We should name this path after our King!"
 bavariaevent.3.t: "Common Policy with [From.GetNameDef]"
 bavariaevent.3.d: "Our recent political actions have impressed the [From.GetAdjectiveCap] ministers and politicians. After many discussions, proposals and debates, our two countries finally agreed to make common policy and to grow stronger together in the future - side by side."
 bavariaevent.3.a: "A Prost to our new [From.GetAdjectiveCap] friends!"
 bavariaevent.4.t: "Common Policy with [From.GetNameDef]"
 bavariaevent.4.d: "Afraid that our latest try to make common policy with the [From.GetAdjectiveCap] would stir up the relations between them and other German states, [From.GetName] denied our proposal. However, they seem to be moved by our newly embraced open politics and want to stay on friendly terms."
 bavariaevent.4.a: "It is a shame, but we will have to respect their decision."
 bavariaevent.5.t: "[From.GetName] Proposes Common Policy"
 bavariaevent.5.d: "Today [From.GetNameDef] proposed common policy between our two countries. They think that this is a good way to improve the relations between us."
 bavariaevent.5.a: "[From.GetNameDef] are our friends. We should accept."
 bavariaevent.5.b: "Even if our countries are both German, there is a reason for why we are independent."
 #Unification
 bavariaevent.7.t: "The German Question"
 bavariaevent.7.d: "Now that the German threat is gone, the Austrians will look forward to unite Germany as they like. Luckily, we chose the right side and are now one of the winners. As such, we are allowed to partake in the peace talks. We could try to have a say and get a few advantages for ourselves, but we also could leave it up to the Austrians. However, if we were to take part in the peace talks, we would need to keep in mind that our chance of achieving what we want would be dependent on how much our country developed or performed in the war."
 bavariaevent.7.a: "We should try to have a say."
 bavariaevent.7.b: "Let's leave it up to the Austrians."
 bavariaevent.8.t: "Treaty of Frankfurt"
 bavariaevent.8.d: "The peace talks are finally here. As we decided to have a say and be present during the talks, we now have to propose our demands or suggestions. As the North, led by Prussia, lost the war, we now have full control over Germany and can push through our interests.\n\nFirstly, we could demand the annexation of the Ruhrgebiet by Bavaria, as we already own Palatinate in that region. This could greatly benefit our industry, but we should be aware that if the Austrians do not recognize Bavaria as an industrializing country, we would have little chances in succeeding with this demand.\n\nAnother approach would be to just sit at the table, but let the Austrians do all the actual work. Being present at the peace talks and being victorious already makes us quite popular. Additionally, it would not be a bad idea to be on the good side of the Austrians.\n\nThe by far most daring suggestions would be the ones concerning the German unification. As to not be completely thrown aside, we could try to submit some ideas on how the unification should go."
 bavariaevent.8.a: "The Ruhr is rightfully Bavarian soil. We should demand it to be handed over to us."
 bavariaevent.8.b: "Whatever the Austrians say, we should agree for the sake of relations."
 bavariaevent.8.c: "Unification is key. Conveniently, we have some ideas how it could be reached."
 bavariaevent.9.t: "Bavaria Demands the Ruhrgebiet"
 bavariaevent.9.d: "Taking part in the peace talks, [BAV.GetNameDef] today demanded the Ruhr to be officially handed over to them. As we have defeated the Prussians on the field, we theoretically can do whatever we want with that piece of land. In fact, if Bavaria were to annex the Ruhrgebiet, it would weaken the industry of [PRS.GetNameDef] immensely. We could, however, decline and do something else with it."
 bavariaevent.9.a: "Let them have it. Bavaria is a friend."
 bavariaevent.9.b: "We shouldn't give Bavaria more power."
 bavariaevent.10.t: "Deutscher Staatenbund"
 bavariaevent.10.d: "As no apparent answer to the German Question could have been found until now, we have to decide what to do for the time being. Unification seems to be a much more complicated thing to accomplish than we thought it would be, and now we have to act before the German states turn away from us.\nMany in our government have come to like the temporary idea of forming a Schutzbund, a temporary, protective federation, to ensure stability and safety along the German areas. It was decided that this faction is to be established within the next days. However, it is yet to be decided how to handle this federation; we could either directly subjugate the German states and initiate the Schutzbund to play safe, or we could create the Schutzbund without subjugating anyone, as that could lead to mistrust."
 bavariaevent.10.a: "Let's play safe."
 bavariaevent.10.b: "The Schutzbund alone should be enough."
 bavariaevent.11.t: "Bavaria Proposes Unification"
 bavariaevent.11.d: "Today [BAV.GetNameDef] proposed the final unification of Germany under Bavaria as our subject. Every German state would be forcefully annexed by them, to be ruled from Vienna through Munich. If we were to agree to this proposal, German unification would finally be accomplished and we would have full power over all German land without risking too much, like protests in our home country. However, we have to keep in mind that this possibly could be a power grab from Bavaria, even though they have been quite well-disposed towards us."
 bavariaevent.11.a: "So be it."
 bavariaevent.11.b: "We will decide by ourselves how to handle this."
 bavariaevent.12.t: "Bavaria Proposes Unification"
 bavariaevent.12.d: "Today [BAV.GetNameDef] proposed the final unification of Germany under Bavaria as our subject. Every German state would be annexed by them, to be ruled from Vienna through Munich, except from the ones who were our allies in the past war. Instead, our past allies, mostly consisting of the southern German states, would be asked whether they would like to become a part of the to be formed German Confederation. If they deny, they will simply become subjects of the new Germany, maintaining their old and rightful borders and territories. It is now up to us to decide whether this new Germany becomes reality, or not."
 bavariaevent.12.a: "Bavaria has been a good friend of ours. For a new Germany!"
 bavariaevent.12.b: "We have better ideas than that."
 bavariaevent.13.t: "The Road to Unification"
 bavariaevent.13.d: "The time has come to present our plans for Germany to the Austrians. Still, we need to decide what exactly we will propose to them; on that matter we have two major ideas on how to establish a unified Germany.\n\nThe first idea would be to forcefully unify Germany under Bavaria, while Bavaria itself becomes a subjugated state of Austria. This would make our dream of a Bavarian Germany reality, even if Austria would become our overlord.\n\nThe second idea would be to give the German states who were our allies in the previous war a choice: either they join us and become a part of the New Germany, or they maintain their borders, but are subjugated to us.\n\nWhile the first idea sounds more pleasing, the second one would ensure that no previous ally turns sour on us. However, we should note that the ones who have the final say remain the Austrians. Whether they will accept our proposal depends on how we decided to be seen by the other European powers."
 bavariaevent.13.a: "We will unite Germany, even if this could bother some people."
 bavariaevent.13.b: "We can not afford to upset our allies."
 bavariaevent.14.t: "German Unification"
 bavariaevent.14.d: "The German peace talks seem to be coming to an end, and with that it seems that Austria has accepted Bavaria's proposal of unification; unification is but a step away. All German states who have been allied to [AUS.GetNameDef] have now to make a decision. Either they become a direct part of the new Germany, or they maintain their borders and territories, but become a subject. As we are one of the past allies, we have to make a choice."
 bavariaevent.14.a: "We will become a part of the new Confederation."
 bavariaevent.14.b: "Unification was never our dream. We want our [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] borders."
 bavariaevent.15.t: "[From.GetNameDef] Becomes Part of Germany"
 bavariaevent.15.d: "As the [From.GetName] today announced, their realm will become a part of the newly formed Germany. [From.GetAdjectiveCap] politicians will be integrated into the new political system as ministers and general members of the government."
 bavariaevent.15.a: "Finally the German dream becomes reality."
 bavariaevent.16.t: "[From.GetNameDef] Becomes Subject of Germany"
 bavariaevent.16.d: "As the [From.GetName] today announced, the [From.GetName] will hold on to their borders and territories. Instead of becoming a part of the new Germany, they rather would preserve their culture, political system, and land, but turn into our subject."
 bavariaevent.16.a: "They have to suit themselves."
 bavariaevent.17.t: "Germany United!"
 bavariaevent.17.d: "Today we received word that the German war between Austria and Prussia concluded in a victory of the South - meaning Austria and it's allies. A peace conference was held, deciding on how to proceed with the German states. Bavaria, the biggest southern German state, proposed uniting Germany under her, to be ruled from Vienna, Austria. The Austrians accepted the Bavarian proposal, seemingly liking the sound of finally uniting the German states, and as such [GEC.GetNameDef] was born. However, as the former Prussian allies and Prussia itself were forcefully integrated into the new country, it is yet to be seen whether this new Germany will hold."
 bavariaevent.17.a: "Hurra!"
 bavariaevent.17.b: "Good for them."
 bavariaevent.18.t: "[From.GetNameDef] Agrees"
 bavariaevent.18.d: "Austria has agreed to our proposal. The German unification under Bavaria can now become a real thing. "
 bavariaevent.18.a: "Cheers!"
 bavariaevent.19.t: "[From.GetNameDef] Denies"
 bavariaevent.19.d: "Austria denied our proposal. They will now push through their own ideas and plans, instead of listening to others."
 bavariaevent.19.a: "Damn."
 bavariaevent.20.t: "Bavarian Freiwilligenkorps Rise Up"
 bavariaevent.20.d: "Seeing how the treacherous Prussians attacked our beloved country, the Bavarian people are in turmoil. Multiple organized bodies have risen up and joined our army to help us in the defense of Bavaria. Generally, these Freiwilligenkorps are badly equipped, but they will do their best to help us out, understanding that if Bavaria falls, their beliefs will forcefully too. Together, we will stand firm against the Prussian revolutionary, united and arm in arm."
 bavariaevent.20.a: "Bavaria will never fall!"
 
 bavariaevent.22.t: "Railway Line from Munich to Vienna - Planning Complete"
 bavariaevent.22.d: "Plans have existed since the early 1850s to connect the Bavarian capital Munich to Vienna via railway. After initial failure, the plan has recently been revitalized, much to the joy of the Austrian Empress Elisabeth, who is a Bavarian native. The planning for the railway line has been completed now. It will run southeast from Munich to Rosenheim, from where it will continue in eastern direction to Berchtesgaden and meet the line from Austria behind the border at Salzburg. The line is scheduled to go into service in approximately three years time. If we decide to support this initiative, the new railway line would surely benefit our economy and our mutual understanding with the Austrians."
 bavariaevent.22.a: "Sounds good."
 bavariaevent.22.b: "Stop our support for the railway projects."
 bavariaevent.23.t: "Segment from Rosenheim to Traunstein in Service"
 bavariaevent.23.d: "As part of our effort to construct a railway line from Munich to Vienna, the segment between Rosenheim and Traunstein has finally been opened for service. Construction was delayed due to the difficult terrain and soil conditions around the Chiemsee."
 bavariaevent.23.a: "Gute Reise!"
 bavariaevent.23.b: "Stop our support for the railway projects."
 bavariaevent.24.t: "Segment from Traunstein to Salzburg in Service"
 bavariaevent.24.d: "As part of our effort to construct a railway line from Munich to Vienna, the last segment between Traunstein and Salzburg has finally been opened for service. The line from Munich to Vienna can now operate without change and interruption. The inauguration ceremony, attented by Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and the Empress Elisabeth as well as her relative, King Maximilian II, will commence in a few days."
 bavariaevent.24.a: "Gute Reise!"
 bavariaevent.24.b: "Stop our support for the railway projects."
 bavariaevent.25.t: "Rosenheim-Kufstein Line in Service"
 bavariaevent.25.d: "As part of the railway concessions agreed upon by the state and the investors, the railway line from Rosenheim to Kufstein, at the Austrian border, has been completed. It's the first railway line in the southern part of Bavaria and connects the region to Munich via railway, which will surely promote industry and tourism in the whole region."
 bavariaevent.25.a: "Gute Reise!"
 bavariaevent.25.b: "Stop our support for the railway projects."
 bavariaevent.26.t: "Ostbahn - Segment Munich-Landshut in Service"
 bavariaevent.26.d: "As part of the railway concessions agreed upon by the state and the investors, the Ostbahn segment from Munich to Landshut has been completed. The line will continue to Passau via Straubing. That railway line is supposed to be finished in around two years time, if we decide to continue our support for the railway projects."
 bavariaevent.26.a: "Gute Reise!"
 bavariaevent.26.b: "Stop our support for the railway projects."
 bavariaevent.27.t: "Ostbahn - Segment Landshut-Regensburg-Nürnberg in Service"
 bavariaevent.27.d: "As part of the railway concessions agreed upon by the state and the investors, the Ostbahn segment from Landshut to Regensburg and the connection to Nuremburg has been completed. The line will continue to Passau. That railway line is supposed to be finished in about a year, if we decide to continue our support for the railway projects."
 bavariaevent.27.a: "Gute Reise!"
 bavariaevent.27.b: "Stop our support for the railway projects."
 bavariaevent.28.t: "Ostbahn - Segment Regensburg-Straubing-Passau in Service"
 bavariaevent.28.d: "As part of the railway concessions agreed upon by the state and the investors, the Ostbahn segment from Regensburg via Straubing to Passau has been completed. The line will continue to Passau. There are other railway lines planned connecting the northeast of Bavaria to Bohemia, if we decide to continue our support for the railway projects."
 bavariaevent.28.a: "Gute Reise!"
 bavariaevent.28.b: "Stop our support for the railway projects."
 bavariaevent.29.t: "Ostbahn - Segment Schwandorf-Cham-Bohemian Border in Service"
 bavariaevent.29.d: "As part of the railway concessions agreed upon by the state and the investors, the Ostbahn segment from Schwandorf to the Bohemian border via Cham has been completed. The line will eventually connect the Bavarian railway network to Prague."

 ###Leaders###
 POLITICS_MAXIMILIAN_II_DESC: "Upon taking the responsibility of the throne after his father’s passing, Maximilian II restored stability of the Kingdom during the German Revolution of 1848. King Max, as his followers call him, stands up for Bavarian independence and culture, making him very popular among the people. Unlike his father, Maximilian takes more interest in governmental issues than personal extravagance. Following his policy of making Bavaria into a center of culture, education and arts, Maximilian II declined the Frankfurt Constitution proposed by the Frankfurt Assembly, triggering the 1849 Palatine uprising. With the help of the Prussian army and Bavarian military corps, however, the revolt was broken."
 POLITICS_BAV_LUDWIG_II_DESC: "Ludwig II Otto Friedrich Wilhelm von Wittelsbach ascended to the throne of King of Bavaria at the age of 18 after his father had died of an illness, not prepared for high office and unknown to politicians. Ludwig is committed to culture; his love for Richard Wagner's music, however, raised many concerns among the Bavarian government and first and foremost his own family. Maximilian II, his father, once said "You're a dreamer, Ludwig. Do you know what your love for art is in reality? Weakness" during a demonstration of the new M/1842 rifle. With straining relations with Prussia all we can do is hope our new King, Ludwig II, will lead us to glory, and not our doom."
