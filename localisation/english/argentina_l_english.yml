### EVENTS ###
 arg.1.t: "Unification of Argentina"
 arg.1.d: "We have finally done it, we had cast off the vile Unitarians who wished to engage us under the whims of Buenos Aires. It is a time to celebrate, and a time to unify our nation. However, our disorganization had dragged us and almost cost the Confederation, and this disorganization can be attested to the Confederation itself. We will not get rid of the Confederation, however it could come to be a good idea to offer some slight powers to a Central Government to help lead the nation, but we may face some resistance doing so."
 arg.1.a: "Some reforms may be needed..."
 arg.1.b: "Long Live the Confederation!"
 arg.2.t: "Unification of Argentina"
 arg.2.d: "We have finally done it, we had cast off the vile Federalists who wished to decentralize and destroy Argentina! It is a time to celebrate, but also a time to unify our nation. We must implement federal power on the states, and end the Confederation of Provinces. Now being appointed, [BUE.GetLeader] has been named as the President of Argentina!"
 arg.2.a: "Long Live Argentina!"
 arg.3.t: "Capital Debate"
 arg.3.d: "Now that Buenos Aires is back under our control, there is some debate as to its place in our Confederation. After all, this was the state that rebelled against us, but it is also the most influential and prosperous city in La Plata. Should it become the head of the Confederation once more?"
 arg.3.a: "Move to Buenos Aires"
 arg.3.b: "Not after what they did!"
 arg.4.t: "Reescalation of the Civil War"
 arg.4.d: "Mitre has had enough of the dominance of the Argentine Confederation, he has begun to raise troops to declare war on the Argentine Confederation, and deal with it once and for all!"
 arg.4.a: "For Argentina!"
 arg.5.t: "Argentina Demands our Lands!"
 arg.5.d: "In de jure, Argentina holds control of some territory that we de facto have control over. However, with the spike of Argentinian settlement in the area, they have begun to demand for the lands to officially be turned over to them. If we were mere primatives, they would have been able to easily seize it. However, we are not, and now we must decide to give up the land or not. If we refuse, it is almost guarenteed to lead to war."
 arg.5.a: "Hand it over..."
 arg.5.b: "It's ours!"
 arg.6.t: "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses to Cede Land!"
 arg.6.d: "In response to our demand to transfer official control of our rightful territory, the [From.GetName] have decided to further push their claim over the lands! What should we do?"
 arg.6.a: "Take it by force!"
 arg.6.b: "It's useless anyway..."
 arg.7.t: "Argentina wants to Negotiate"
 arg.7.d: "The lands to the south of us is not formally colonized, and now the Argentinians hold interest in colonizing this land. It should be a priority for us to negotiate a border between our two nations."
 arg.7.a: "Negotiate!"
 arg.7.b: "Never!"
 arg.8.t: "Border Negotiation"
 arg.8.d: "The Chileans have sent an emissary to discuss the possibility of negotiating a border between us, as we hold interest in colonizing our south. This is exactly what we wanted, and now we can discuss our plans. We must now decide which plan we should try and pitch to the Chileans."
 arg.8.a: "The Mountains are a suitable border"
 arg.8.b: "Argentina takes all!"
 arg.8.c: "Chile takes all!"
 arg.9.t: "Argentina's Plan"
 arg.9.d_normal: "Argentina has presented their plan: that the Mountains that currently separate our nations be what continues our seperation as we colonize the South. This is a good plan, but it will make our nation very thin and miss out on some oppertunities..."
 arg.9.d_chile: "Surprisingly, the Argentinians have come up with the plan to give Chile all of the territory south of their respected borderlines. Already, this is astonishing of a choice, but we could see some Argentinian support if we grant them some land..."
 arg.9.d_arg: "Argentina seems to insult us, with their offer of just 'Argentina gets all of the Southern lands', even the lands that hold a respectful amount of settlement to be called our own! We can dispute it, but could we?"
 arg.9.a: "Accept the Mountain Border"
 arg.9.b: "Enforce Mountain Border, but no Guarentees"
 arg.9.c: "Give it all to Argentina..."
 arg.9.e: "Give it all to us!"
 arg.10.t: "Response from Chile"
 arg.10.d_normal: "Chile has handed in their response, and they are in full agreement to our Mountain Plan. The mountains shall define our borderline."
 arg.10.d_decline: "Chile held suspicion on our plan. They had pushed that we should hold the Mountains as the border, but they do not completely hold on claims past the mountains. After hours of struggle and negotiation, our ambassador had finally given in and accepted. Although this will mean both we and Chile will hold claims over each other, we still have to abide by the mountain treaty, so long as it lasts..."
 arg.10.d_arg: "The Chilean embassy begrudgingly, due to their current situation, agreed to our proposal. The entirety of the southern portion of this continent shall belong to Argentina!"
 arg.10.d_chile: "The Chilean government had quickly and fervently accepted the offer to take the entire southern portion of the continent..."
 arg.10.a: "Okay"
 arg.10.b: "They won't hide from us!"
 arg.10.c: "Good!"
 arg.10.e: "Damn!"
 arg.11.t: "The Tip Question"
 arg.11.d: "The Island of Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost island in the Americas, is under dispute. We should hold territory in that island, but the Chileans already have a settlement there. We must negotiate how this island shall be handed out..."
 arg.11.a: "Split the Island!"
 arg.11.b: "All to Argentina!"
 arg.11.c: "All to Chile!"
 arg.12.t: "The Tip Question"
 arg.12.d: "Now, although we made deals on most of the land south of us, we have yet to fully decide the fate of Tierra del Fuego, the island in the southernmost part of the continent. We must now choose what happens to the island..."
 arg.12.a: "Split the island!"
 arg.12.b: "We won't negotiate this!"
 arg.12.c: "Give it to Argentina"
 arg.12.e: "Take it all!"
 arg.13.t: "Island Debate Over"
 arg.13.d: "The debates over the island are over, and although it has not necessary ended all argument over the territoriality of the island, it has been decided that the Island..."
 arg.13.a: "Is Split!"
 arg.13.b: "Is Argentinian!"
 arg.13.c: "Is Chilean!"
 arg.13.e: "Is Disputed!"
 arg.14.t: "End of Negotiation"
 arg.14.d_negotiate: "The Chilean and Argentinian governments have ended their negotiation over the Southern territories. How the points were decided may determine the future of South America."
 arg.14.a: "Okay"
 arg.15.t: "Chile refuses Negotiation!"
 arg.15.d: "Chile refuses to negotiate with us about the territories south of us! We must prepare for what will come of this..."
 arg.15.a: "Damn!"
 arg.16.t: "[BUE.GetName] asks for support"
 arg.16.a: "Give them our support"
 arg.16.b: "Ignore this rogue state"
 arg.17.t: "[ENG.GetName] gives us support"
 arg.18.t: "[ENG.GetName] Ignores us"
 arg.18.d: "The [ENG.GetAdjective] have declined our request for assistance because of political differences and interests lying elsewhere."

 arg.20.t: "Pacifaction of La Rioja"
 arg.20.d: "Our mission in La Roija has been successful. The upstart governer of the province, Angel Penaloza was defeated and then executed by the leader of our troops in the area Pablo Irrazabal."
 arg.20.a: "Perfect"
 arg.21.t: "End of the Argentine Civil War"
 arg.21.d: "The Argentine Civil War, which has gone on for almost a decade, is finally over. As the dust settles over the plains of La Plata, the seccessionist state Buenos Aires stands. \n \nBuenos Aires declared independence from the Argentine Confederation based on its Constitution; which stipulated the importance of keeping the Central Government as weak as possible. Buenos Aires, which was the most powerful state in La Plata, rejected this and declared independence back in 1852. After a recent reescalation of conflict, Buenos Aires has finally managed to defeat the Confederation. \n \nTime will tell what this will bring to the future of South America."
 arg.21.d_confed: "The Argentine Civil War, which has gone on for almost a decade, is finally over. As the dust settles over the plains of La Plata, the old Confederation stands. \n \nIn order to defend themselves against foreign threat, the provinces of La Plata united into a Confederation, which stipulated the need of a Decentralized government. This angered the city of Buenos Aires, which was the most powerful state in La Plata. The declared independence back in 1852, and after a recent reescalation of the conflict, they were defeated at the hands of the Confederation. \n \nTime will tell what this will bring to the future of South America."
 arg.21.a: "Good for Argentina"
 arg.21.b: "For Argentina!"
 arg.22.t: "Reescalation of the Argentine Civil War"
 arg.22.d: "The eight year long stalemate between the Argentine Confederation and Buenos Aires have broken, the Argentine Civil War has resumed. \n \nAfter the September 11th Revolution in 1852, the city of Buenos Aires acted independent from the Argentine Confederate government. Although foreign nations recognized the Confederation, the city of Buenos Aires was the most powerful and prosperous city in La Plata, which seriously damaged the capabilities of the Confederation. Now, the Governor of Buenos Aires, [BUE.GetLeader], has called for the renewal of war to end the Confederation. \n \nArgentina has become embroiled in another war against itself."
