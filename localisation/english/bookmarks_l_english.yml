 END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Empires are at their might. The powers of Europe spread their influence wide and far from the plains of Africa to the mountains of Asia. The end of the Crimean War ensures decades of peace and dust begins to settle in the Americas. Everything seems seamless, and the spread of civilization has brought another Renaissance onto the world. Yet cracks are not unseen; the British colonies of India crumble, and only God foresees what this will mean for the colonial powers. \n The end of a system written in centuries is nigh, an end that will bring a new beginning to the world as we know it."

 ENG_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Decades of the Victorian Era has shown the uncontested British rule of the Atlantic. The crown shines as the sun that never sets upon the very edges of the known world, and each British frontier serves as a jewel in it. The world changes, however; the final jewel of India begins to crack under pressure. Religious conflicts have inflated to the point of threatening the position of the undefeatable Empire, and when one colony topples the rest would follow. Now the most feared has happened, the rebels have captured Delhi, and established a base. Britain still has plenty of men at her disposal, but without caution this very mutiny could lead to the downfall of India."
 USA_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "America enjoys a generation of prosperity and growth. Following the Manifest Destiny, the United States have expanded their reach to the lands once seized by the natives and Mexicans. Although the States aren't absolutely free from conflict, the Mormon rebellion in Utah troubles the nation, and continued arguments about the rights of slaves go on within the Free States and Border Ruffians. \nThese scars left untreated will leave a conflict that troubles the very Constitution of the United States, and left unresolved will eventually rip the nation apart."
 FRA_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Not a few months ago, the Treaty of Paris ended the bloody conflict between Russia and the allied forces, bringing another era of 'peace' to the powers of Europe. Balance in the Black Sea has been restored; but the French Empire is hardly at rest. France still is taking its time rebuilding its Empire, and Napoleon III's ambitions towards the Italian lands bring tension to arise in the Alps. \nShrouded in prestige of victory and a new empire, France is meeting a new era."
 PRS_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Prussia is on the rise. The victory of the Napoleonic Era still is engraved within the Prussians, and ever since they have faced no defeat. Controlling most of the German states, Prussia has grown to a world-wide power ever since the Revolutions of 1848. However even within the German Confederation, the rivalry between Prussia and the Austrian Empire troubles the weakly confined states. With King Frederick William's health on the line, the nation is more vulnerable than ever. \nNot only Prussia recognizes her strength, and it is time to prove how it can be used."
 RUS_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Bitterness of defeat spreads across the nation, as the Crimean War has come to an end with the Russians on the short end of the stick. Modernization might have been too large of a task for Russia, and now after the humiliation they have suffered the road to reformation will only grow steeper. However all is not yet lost; Russia still has many roads to recover from the wars. The Qing are battered from the Opium Wars, and the Afghans remain an open ground for the Empire. \n Russia's history is only to start now."
 AUS_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The Austrian Empire has been the uncontested power of Central Europe for centuries. Their reign and influence spans over tens of nationalities and the remnants of the Habsburg house still resides within countless numbers of courts. Their power was challenged once with the rise of Napoleon, but with the Western threat quelled and Russia recently defeated in the Crimean War, no-one in Europe remains to challenge the Austrian's power on land. But all is not stable; the intricate balance settled decades ago has broken 9 years ago, and Prussia continues to threat Austria by expanding their power in German lands."
 PIE_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Preparations for a new Italy are complete. Cavour has proved his legitimacy with the alliance of the Crimean through srew diplomacy, and elevated the Kingdom of Sardinia to the order of the world powers. Sardinia-Piedmont has come a long way; but still a long road remains. The heart of the Roman Empire is controlled by the Papacy, and Southern Italy by the Two Sicilies. How a new Italy will be sculpted is decided on how the three powers retain their balance in the peninsula, and defend themselves from the cowering powers of Europe. The Risorgimento seems a step's pace far, but is a mile's march away."
 QNG_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "In 1644 the Manchu forces seized the Ming capital of Beijing and proclaimed the founding of the Qing Dynasty, with a period of economic prosperity as well as major expansion of the great empire, often referred to as the 'High Qing era'. That period is however, a mere nostalgic past to remember for the empire as that era has come to an end, with the Qing that once stood tall now on its knees. In the early 1800s, the British made a daring move to start the opium trade in China, causing large amounts of silver to flow out of the empire. When the Qing started their crackdown on opium by throwing raided warehouses that contained large quantities of opium into the ocean, the British waged the First Opium War against the Qing, ultimately defeating the Qing in a landslide victory while forcing the Qing to sign unequal treaties in 1842. With the signing of these treaties, the  'century of humiliation' that would continue to haunt China for decades had started. The empire's situation only got worse when ethnic tensions grew causing locals to arm themselves for a rebellion against their Qing rulers, pushing the Qing to be in a state of total collapse, as well as the point of losing their Mandate of Heaven... Will the Qing learn from its mistakes and restore their Mandate of Heaven or will the Qing fail to and be overrun by traitors and foreign devils?"
 KOR_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The Joseon Dynasty has been ruling the Korean Peninsula since 1392. During the rule of the Joseon Confucianism has been cemented as the state ideology and religion of Korea while the prominence of Buddhism and other religions has been discouraged. Following the Japanese invasions of Korea in the 16th and 17th centuries which nearly resulted in the destruction of the country, the Joseon dynasty has since followed a strict policy of isolation which the West has dubbed the Hermit Kingdom. But as the turn of the century approaches and the 19th century continues on many new challenges are present in Korea. The once strong Joseon Dynasty has become nothing more than a puppet of the Andong Kim Clan, and the government is full of corrupt officials with misplaced loyalties as different clans compete for power. New schools of thought threaten the traditions of Confucianism in Korea, and the people are suffering. While all these internal affairs bring people to borderline rebellion, a new threat is coming to the East. The Western nations have finally taken an interest in the nations of the East. The once great Korean ally of the Qing has collapsed into internal rebellion and foreign invasion, and the western powers influence war in Japan in order for their doors to be opened. It won't be long until these nations turn their eyes onto Korea."
 POR_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Portugal has gone through a period of reform and revolt recently. After the old party has abdicated in 1851, a time of industrial modernization and political instability has formed Portugal to what it is now: a fair naval power with some colonial ambitions, ready to impose its will on the world."
 BRA_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The Empire of Brazil was put through revolts and political instability during the Regency. Once the Emperor took power, he started to reform the country, and with efficient diplomacy, he managed to ensure Brazilian hegemony in South America, and with economic and scientific innovations, Brazil is now in a golden age. But the countries in South America threaten the Empire. \nSlavery and Industrialization are problems that the Emperor needs to solve, it depends on the population whether Brazil will become a superpower or will collapse."
 GRE_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Greece, the cradle of Western Civilization, this mountainous corner of Europe had for centuries been part of various empires until the Revolution of 1821. The ten-year war that ensued against the Ottomans and their allies would end with the Battle of Navarino. Britain, France and Russia helped Greece win independence and installed Otto von Wittelsbach as King.\n Greece however in 1857 is a nation full of contrasts: a rich history and a poor present. Greece is heavily in debt, weakened by political strife and always willing to liberate her children living in Ottoman lands. The Hellenic nation has been reborn and needs firm hands to lead it to glory."
 MEX_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Mexico has not been treated kindly by its neighbours. After a decade-long struggle with Spain for their independence, they lost most of their territory to the United States, with those external conflicts throwing them into multiple civil wars and crippling debt. Facing those issues, the liberals now in power want to rapidly reform. However, it is uncertain if they will succeed."
 DOM_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Welcome el Presidente! I, your wonderful and brilliant advisor, have brought you the status of the Dominican Republic. We have recently fought an independence war, but at a cost... loans. The country is now on the brink of bankruptcy and economic turmoil. Though it's not just the economy that threatens to implode our young republic. In the west lies Haiti, who believes all of Hispaniola is rightfully theirs. It is up to you, El Presidente, to climb out of this hole, repay our debts, and survive the looming Haitian threat! I know you'll do an outstanding job! Or... at least the next El Presidente will!"
 TSH_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "It is an uncertain time for the centuries-old Tokugawa Shogunate. Since 1853, the fear of the West finally breaking down the wall of isolationism that had protected Japan since the 17th century was realized under the weight of Commodore Matthew Perry's famous demand for the opening of Japan. With the arrival of his ominous "black ships", a decade of sociopolitical and economic strife has ravaged the islands. The people are divided over whether to trust these foreigners, or remove them by any means necessary. Whether the Japanese people will put their faith in the Shōgun or the Emperor to carry out this decision, only time will tell..."

Feng established the God Worshipper's Society, Hong joining in 1847. Hong led the society into rebellion against the Qing Dynasty, starting the Taiping Rebellion. In 1851 this rebellion became the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. 1853 would see the Kingdom take the city of Nanjing. Will the Kingdom and Hong be able to survive the Qing Dynasty?"

Together with his Minister Ludwig von der Pfordten, King Max tries to strengthen the idea of the Trias, the so-called Third Deutschland. Along with Austria-Prussian tensions rising, Bavaria has to take a stance on who to trust and to follow - if someone like this even exists."
 SWE_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The old 'Lion of the North' and its political achievements during the 1800s have been a mixed bag. The 'prize' of the War of the Seventh Coalition, the 1814 Union with Norway, is very unpopular with our Norwegian subjects and a despised symbol of their lost freedoms.\n\nCertainly, Sweden has seen better days than this. Despite its misfortunes, Sweden moves forth into an unknown future. Its path remains unclear, and in a world that rapidly changes it will have to struggle to find a place it can call her own. Whether it will manage or not, only time will tell..."
 DEN_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The Kingdom of Denmark has been a regional power in Northern Europe for centuries, spreading its influence from the fjords of Norway and Iceland to the plains of northernmost Germany, and recently prospering from four decades of trade and economic growth.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark traded with both the French and the English throughout most of the war, but after Denmark's association with the League of Armed Neutrality, with Russia, Sweden, and Prussia, and the subsequent bombing of Copenhagen by the British, the Danes sided with Napoleon. Napoleon's fall from grace meant that Denmark was forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Kiel with the Sixth Coalition, where it agreed to irrevocably renounce claims to the Kingdom of Norway.\n\nHowever, Denmark was able to retain most of its older colonies, namely the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Iceland, although the Icelanders themselves are demonstrating their discontent with the situation by constantly revolting against the Danish administration. Apart from the Nordic holdings, Denmark has so far been able to retain one of its Indian colonies, the Nicobar Islands, but possessions at the Danish Gold Coast were sold to Great Britain in 1850. In the Caribbean, the Virgin Islands are still under Danish administration.\n\nThe 1830s and 1840s witnessed the birth of large-scale liberal and national movements across the country, gaining in momentum during the European Revolutions of 1848-49. Following his coronation in 1848, King Frederick was immediately met with demands for a constitution, which eventually ended absolutism in Denmark. The Duchies of Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg, which had been under Danish control for decades, pressed for an independent state whereas the Danish wished to subjugate Schleswig, or Southern Jutland as they refer to it, under the direct control of the Kingdom of Denmark. King Frederick accepted the demands from Danish nationalists but refused to allow the creation of an independent state of Schleswig-Holstein, which consequently looked south for backing.\n\nThe Three Years' War between 1848 and 1851 ended in a victory for the Danish monarchy over the German revolutionaries, including a significant boost of stability across the country. King Frederick was titled a war hero and a national leader, despite never actively taking part on the battlefield. The victorious war also initiated the rise of the National Liberal Party and their new-found influence led to many political and economic reforms, like the recent introduction of free trade. The first Danish railways were constructed in the 1850s and the network is continuing to grow expansively across the country.\n\nOverseas trade and improved communications have led to an abundance of industrial development despite Denmark's lack of natural resources. A notable migration pattern has also emerged across the country as many people from the countryside move into the cities as Danish agriculture now centers on the simple export of dairy and meat products.\n\nDenmark's position has the potential to be of great importance, as it is largely in control of the connection between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, with strategic outposts spanning the Nordic colonies in the Northern Atlantic. However, tensions are slowly rising as a storm seems to be brewing over Central Europe. Will the Kingdom of Denmark be able to resist foreign threats and consolidate its power or will the 19th century mark the end of Denmark as a significant European power?"
 FIN_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The Grand Duchy of Finland, a young subject nation to the Russian Empire, is experiencing an era of exploring one's lost identity.\nFinland, being the lost provinces of the old Swedish Empire, which Sweden lost as a part of the Finnish War of 1808-1809. The Finnish war was a northern division of the Napoleonic wars of the same era, at which end, Finland no longer adhered to Sweden, which many nations in the north referred as the 'the old father'.\nToday the Finnish nation is following a new master, one more liberal and open. A nation enjoying the existence of its state, culture and language, under the more liberal Tsar Alexander the II, in exchange for loyalty, armies and taxes. Times are changing, and so is the Grand Duchy of Finland. Will the Finnish Lion roar in the defense of the Fennomans or adhere to the culture of the Old Empire with Svecomans?"
 PRU_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Peru finally achieved its independence from Spain fighting alongside many South American rebellious republics in 1821. The young republic rose in its first years and managed to unite in a confederation with Bolivia, which was heavily opposed and ended in rebellions for disillusion that lead Peru in a period of anarchy as the military fought for power.\nWith President Ramón Castilla liberalizing the nation and educating the population, the ruling classes and the military have revolted and the recovering Republic is once again divided in a state of civil war."
 TUS_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The great Medici Era has long since passed in the once-prominent Tuscany. Long ago, it was the heart of the Renaissance. Now, day by day, the Tuscan legacy and Tuscan influence across Europe dwindles away, forgotten under the shadowy tendrils of Austria. Tuscany once possessed the greatest bank in all of Europe, now, it languishes in poverty with a crippling reliance on agriculture. Despite the current political and economic predicament, Tuscany has not yet faded from relevance. A new page in Italian history has yet to be written as the dawn of liberalism brings on a new age in Europe and Italy, and with this new age, a new opportunity for Tuscany to free itself from the veils it has long since dwelled under."
 NSC_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The Bourbon monarchy assisted Sardinia-Piedmont in the first Austro-Sardinian war along with the Papal States and the volunteers from Italy. After calling back troops from the front, many remained to continue the fight. Liberal radicals in Sicily took the opportunity to rise up against the monarchy. Other revolts across the kingdom attempted to rise up as well, but all revolts were swiftly put down by the Bourbon army. What followed was a brutal repression by King Ferdinand II that continues. Political enemies are exiled and Sicily is being watched closely for more radicals that may be plotting. Though, as King Ferdinand's health declines following an attempt on his life, many circles try to plan for the future of the Kingdom."

 HOL_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The 19th century hasn't been kind to the Netherlands with the loss of Belgium, a part of their colonies and the VOC, the Netherlands have hard and turmoil filled times ahead. The coming years will determine if they're going to gain their place in the sun or forever get left behind as an unimportant and small state at the edge of Europe."
 SPR_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Following the Napoleonic Wars, Spain has gradually been losing power and influence in European politics, up to the point that it now remains little more than a shadow of its former imperial glory.\n\nThe situation of political fragmentation between progressives and moderates prevents the country from advancing, although perhaps the Liberal Union with its centrist policies could stabilize the country. The Carlists, however, continue to fight for the return of the old regime of monarch Don Carlos de Borbón, uncle of Queen Isabel II, and they are ready to seize any opportunity to impose their conditions at the first sign of governmental weakness.\n\nSpain used to be the largest empire in the world. Now, our overseas possessions are confined to the islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean and the Philippines in the Pacific. The Caribbean remains one of our most precious holdings with the greatest economic potential while our expansion into the Pacific has been halted due to the loss of New Spain and the Acapulco-Manila route. Reaffirming our dominance in the Caribbean and, if possible, in the Americas is a priority if we want to regain our rightful place in history.\n\nThe Spanish economy, although largely intact, is hanging by a thread. Debt accumulated during recent governmental efforts to quell civil unrest and the loss of the vast majority of our overseas possessions are putting pressure on the treasury. Investing our money wisely and looking for any opportunity to demand money from other countries will be key to maintaining hopes of economic recovery and industrialization.\n\nIn short, although certainly tedious and painful, a gradual, constant, and well-executed reconstruction process could give the country a fighting chance in this era of industry and power projection. For this to be possible we must preserve governmental stability above all else and choose our political and financial movements very carefully.\n\nThe future is uncertain for the Kingdom of Spain and with every opportunity also comes a threat. We will have to be careful because a false step could mean the final stumble into a spiral of misfortune for the country..."
 BAD_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Although the 1818 constitution was, at the time, the most liberal constitution in all of Germany and Baden continued to liberalize further during the 1830s, reactionary forces from within and without the Grand Duchy were constantly fighting for a more repressive policy. The 1840s were a constant struggle between the powers of liberalism and conservatism, and although the situation had been calming at the end of the decade, the 1848-49 revolutions fell on fertile ground in Baden.\n\nMany insurrectionist groups with different goals rose against the government. The liberal insurgents presented their revolutionary demands to the government in early March 1848 and in his distress, the Grand Duke promised liberal concessions and appointed a new government. Although most liberal objectives had been fulfilled, a group of radical democrats led by Friedrich Hecker and Gustav Struve demanded further action, like a drastic reform of the bicameral parliament of Baden. The failure of their ideals in Frankfurt further radicalized the proponents of the 'Volksvereine' (people's associations) movement.\n\nFollowing the arrest of a fellow companion, Hecker and Struve led a revolutionary band of around 3,000 men on their violent overthrow of the monarchy. The Grand Ducal army was supported by a few thousand soldiers of the German Confederation and managed to defeat the insurgents around the city of Kandern. Many revolutionaries were killed or fled the country, including Hecker who resettled to the United States. A second uprising led by Struve was crushed in September.\n\nAlthough Grand Duke Leopold had accepted the Frankfurt constitution, the rejection of the imperial German crown by Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV inspired new insurrection. This time, the revolutionary spark caught the soldiers of the Bundesfestung in Rastatt and the garrison in Karlsruhe and the Grand Duke fled the country. After the government had been forced into hiding, the revolutionaries held an election following the guidelines of the Frankfurt Parliament. The Grand Duke's options were very limited, and he had to reach out to Prussia for aid and a military intervention. After heavy fighting, the revolutionary army was forced to disperse, and the government was re-instituted under Grand Duke Leopold - a debt to Prussia that remains to this day. The Prussian troops also made sure that Baden entered an era of reactionary principles.\n\nNow, the Grand Duchy of Baden finds itself in a peculiar place in German affairs. Last year, the new Grand Duke Friedrich I finally took over the reigns from his elder brother, Ludwig II, as the latter's mental health is rapidly deteriorating. Friedrich's been running the country since 1852 and now all question marks have officially been removed. However, questions now loom in the form of sovereignty and foreign policy, as the two German great powers, Austria and Prussia, are vying for dominance within the realm, and Emperor Napoleon III has not given up on the Rhine as the natural border of France, at least secretly.\n\nThe Grand Ducal army has still not fully recovered from the disaster of the Napoleonic campaign in Russia and trouble is brewing within the country's religious majority, the Catholics, who are politically underrepresented. The religious divide between the Catholic and Protestant churches has long been a prominent factor in Baden's internal politics, but reconciliation might be possible, as the coronation of Friedrich I sparked a sense of unity across the nation.\n\nWill Baden solve its religious strife and stay a free, influential, and economically evolving state in Southern Germany, or will it merely be a pawn in the hands of its powerful neighbors?"
 SAX_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The 1848-49 revolutions challenged many monarchies across Europe in their self-conception, but very few were more of a hotbed for revolutionary ideals than the Kingdom of Saxony. After the insurgents had successfully forced King Friedrich August II to make concessions and pass liberal reforms in March 1848, the tide soon turned, and the forces of the counter-revolution were gaining ground. When the Frankfurt Constitution eventually failed to gain support from the crowned heads within the German Confederation, Friedrich August was determined to regain full control, too.\n\nThe revolutionary movement was not ready to be brushed aside without a fight, though, and so the insurgents thwarted the king's plans. In May 1849, widespread anarcho-syndicalist and democratic revolts led by known revolutionaries like the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin or the Saxon 'Turnvater', Otto Leonhard Heubner, instigated an overthrow of the monarchy. Supported by popular public figures like Richard Wagner or Gottfried Semper, the revolutionaries took control over Dresden in an attempt to establish a Saxon Republic.\n\nThe king and his government had fled to the Königstein Fortress near Dresden, also known as the 'Saxon Bastille', amidst the growing uprising, but were prepared to use force to take back control. The Saxon army, however, was simultaneously occupied in Schleswig-Holstein, where it supported the German insurgents against the Danish military intervention. So, Friedrich August reached out to Prussia, where the counter-revolution had just succeeded, and a number of Prussian infantry battalions were sent to Saxony to support the Saxon army in their fight against the revolutionaries.\n\nWith the help of the Prussian troops, the Saxon light infantry managed to beat the insurgents after a few days of heavy street battles. Around 300 people were killed and several hundred wounded, but the revolution had collapsed. The main protagonists of the uprising were sentenced to death, but their sentences were mostly converted to life in prison and internment. Some, like Bakunin, were extradited to foreign powers, where they were also tried for their involvement in the uprisings. Many of the revolutionary achievements were scrapped subsequently, the reactionaries had won a decisive victory.\n\nAfter Friedrich August II's death, his brother, King Johann, succeeded the throne in 1854. So far, he has continued the policy of his elder brother, but the two German hegemons, Austria and Prussia, have intensified their struggle for influence within Germany, and the Kingdom of Saxony finds itself at a crossroads. Additionally, the German nationalist movement vocally advocates for greater political and economic integration among the German states, threatening the sovereignty of our country. There may be a way, however, for Saxony to maneuver its way around these obstacles, as several other German minor and middle states are in a similar position and might be interested in collaboration."
 WUR_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "As a member of the German Confederation, the Kingdom of Württemberg has enjoyed a long period of stability since the ascendance of its able monarch, King Wilhelm I, in 1816. Even the revolutionary fervor that swept through Europe in 1848-1849 barely left its mark on the kingdom. In only twenty years, King Wilhelm I has proven to be a frugal ruler who has allowed Württemberg to pay off its massive foreign debt of 25 million Gulden from the Napoleonic Wars. This allowed the government to lower taxes and improve the conditions of trade, agriculture, and the economy in general. Those factors and an improved education system have not only resulted in a decline in poverty but also achieved almost universal literacy among all citizens above the age of 10. The King's foreign policy has so far mainly been focused on trying to create an alliance with the other German middling states of Bavaria, Hannover, and Saxony in order to create a third power to keep Austria and Prussia in check. Looking ahead, there are still some economic challenges left, and Württemberg needs to tread carefully in the political and diplomatic arenas. Although the legacy of the revolutions of 1848 has been, at least practically, laid to rest on the ash heap of history, a strong liberal opposition is still present in the realm. One of the goals of the liberals is to create a united Germany out of all the German-speaking countries and people. If that sentiment starts to gain momentum, there could be trouble ahead. Who might lead such a German nation-state? Prussia and Austria would almost certainly compete for that position, leaving the question of where Württemberg will stand. Will we have to pick a side, or will the middling states find a way to recalibrate the German equilibrium, with the risk of drawing the ire of both Prussia and Austria? Only the ever-echoing clock of time will tell..." 
 SER_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The Serbian Revolution for Independence from the grip of the Ottoman Empire lasted eleven years, from 1804 until 1815, of which the immediate aftermath granted autonomy from the Muslim Empire. During the First Serbian Uprising (1804–1813), led by vožd Karađorđe Petrović, Serbia was independent for almost a decade before the Ottoman army was able to reoccupy the country. Shortly after this, the Second Serbian Uprising began in 1815. Led by Miloš Obrenović, it ended with a compromise between Serbian revolutionaries and Ottoman authorities. The country would be the first to adopt a democratic constitution in Europe on the 15th of February 1835. From an outside perspective, the situation looks strong for the nation, but dark clouds loom overhead."

The land reforms and taxes of the East India Company have pushed millions to the brink of their livelihoods. Now, the latest insult to the people of India has brought revolt, a rumor that the cartridges needed for the newly introduced Enfield Rifle are lubricated with Pig and Cow Oils. India is Britain’s Crown Jewel but they dare treat our faiths and traditions with such blasphemy!\n \nTens of thousands of Sepoy Soldiers have now mutinied against the British Banner, offering a new hope for the people of India. The Indian people have been oppressed for too long. The time to take action is now and take back our fatherland!"
 NOR_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "In the past centuries Norway was part of different unions, but was never independent. In 1807 Denmark-Norway entered the Napoleonic war on France’s side. The war had a devastating effect on the Norwegian, and Danish economies. After the end of the Napoleonic wars, they signed the Treaty of Kiel, where Norway was ceded to Sweden. After a brief period of unsuccessful independence Norway finally agreed to the Union during the Convention of Moss. The Act of Union was negotiated during the spring of 1815, with prime minister Peder Anker leading the Norwegian delegation; it included twelve articles, such as dealing with the king’s authority. We’ll need to see what the future holds for Norway, and for the time being our most important tasks will remain rebuilding our economy, and dealing with internal problems."
 EGY_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The Egyptian Eyalet, which became a state under Muhammad Ali Pasha in 1805, stands at a crossroads. Under Sa'id Pasha's leadership since 1854, Egypt continues modernization efforts, notably the Suez Canal project initiated in 1854. This ambitious endeavor faces financial and technical challenges, as well as geopolitical resistance. Sa'id Pasha's reforms in the military and bureaucracy have aimed to centralize power, causing discontent among local elites. Economically, the focus on cash crops like cotton has integrated Egypt into global markets but increased dependency on foreign loans. Amidst these changes, Egypt navigates its complex relationship with the Ottoman Empire, balancing autonomy and power. Sa'id Pasha's vision propels Egypt towards a more influential role in global affairs, yet the challenges of modernization and economic volatility remain pressing concerns for the state's stability and future growth."

Many states under the German Confederation urge for a new nation; the question is who shall lead it. \n\nFor long Prussia has seen the Austrians as their nemesis, and saw themselves as the heir to the Holy Roman Empire. The false peace within Europe is soon to be shattered."
 AUS_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "After adopting the February Patent not quite far ago, the Austrian Empire is in their prime. Some disputes within the Magyar question the Austrian authority, but the Hungarians are the least of the Austrian problems. \n\nThe newly rising Prussia challenges Austria in their long heritage of Germanic rule, and conflicts over the lands of Schleswig-Holstein rise. The German Question must be settled, one way or another."
 ITA_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "Italy is finally on the verge of unification, after the victory of the Second War of Independence against Austria and the successful Mille expedition. Victor Emmanuel is now the leader of the new Italian Kingdom, proclaimed less than a month ago. \n\nNow the Roman Question of Rome and Venice rises, and within the nation the French control of Savoy and Nice sows discontent. It is questionable if Rome will rise again, but when it does so blood will be spilled."
 OTO_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "Modernization is rapidly under process in Europe, and the Ottomans were chasing the Westernizing process for the last century. It was quite evident that the Ottomans were in decline, despite their close victory in the Crimean Wars. Abdülmecit I is now old, and his rule could end any day. \n\nThe Ottomans are put upon a long road of tribulations, and the following decades will be decisive for their survival."
 ENG_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "The mid-Victorian Era has come in the land where the sun never sets. Russia has been beaten in the Crimean War and at home, peace and prosperity spreads across the empire. The crown of Great Britain seems unchallenged; but even now trouble stirs. England is surrounded by rising threats in both Europe and America. \n\nHow they react will forever change the destiny of the world."
 OTHER_EOANB_DESC: "Pax Britannica, as it is said on the isles of Great Britain and its ever-expanding empire; a power incomparable and lacking hindrance, one without peer nor challenge as nobody dares face Her Majesty's Armada. Its victims suppose elsewise, coining the era instead as Imperium-Britannica, or British Eminence. The conflicts of recent have reshaped and plotted out who will have their influence where, and if contested against the victors, then be damned and included in their spheres of damnation.\nBut there are many nations of old lurking, ready to be explored and conquered, or lead to victory, across the ever-industrializing world . . ."
 
 BLOOD_AND_IRON_NAME: "Blood and Iron"
 BLOOD_AND_IRON_DESC: "The forces of Nationalism are triumphant in Europe. The Kingdom of Piedmont and Prussia ousted the Habsburgs and their allies, with the Italian peninsula finally unified and Bismarck's Realpolitik confederating the Germans under Prussia's influence. As Pax Britannica continues, the British Empire and their influence expand in Africa and Asia. In the New World, Brazil and The United States reconstruct after asserting their dominance in the Americas. \nAs France and Prussia fight a decisive war, the future and stability of Europe is unpredictable and rests in the hands of those two powers."
 ENG_BLOOD_AND_IRON_DESC: "By 1870 the United Kingdom was the most industrialized and the most powerful country in the world. It possessed the world's largest Empire, protected by a very formidable navy. Imperialism was popular and during this period Britain added to her colonial possessions.\n\nHowever, the Industrial revolution had created severe social problems, as Britain became the world's most urbanized country. Over half of her population lived in cities. The social problems were to be found especially in the area of housing, education and health care."
 JAP_BLOOD_AND_IRON_DESC: "The collapse of Japan's Tokugawa shogunate and the restoration of direct imperial power marked the start of the Meiji Restoration. The shogunate's isolationist strategy was challenged in the nineteenth century by Russia, Britain, and the United States, making Japanese feudal elites aware of Japan's susceptibility to superior Western weaponry. Following Commodore Matthew Perry's visit, Japan was obliged to sign a series of unequal treaties that, like China, granted Western powers unique advantages in Japan. Young samurai from feudal lands that had been traditionally antagonistic to the Tokugawa system rose up against the government in retaliation. They declared the Emperor's return to power in January 1868, and the final Tokugawa soldiers surrendered in May 1869, after much intense battle. The revolutionaries have urged the Emperor to issue the Charter Oath, which promises a break between the feudal class restrictions of the past and a search for knowledge that could transform Japan into a modernized, thriving country, featuring a bolstering economy and a Western army. The restoration ushered in the Meiji period, a time of rapid modernization and Westernization."
 PRS_BLOOD_AND_IRON_DESC: "Having only recently been formed, the North German Confederation is considered by many as nothing more than Prussia's first step in German unification. With Austrian interference now no longer a threat following the Brothers War of 1866 and the German Confederation fully dissolved, Prussia has shown now that its dominance over the European continent may soon be undisputed. The federations future prospects seem to only be positive, even now as France continues to show abject disapproval of its rise in power and influence. Ever so close to unification, the stage is now set for the North German Confederation to make its most critical and decisive move yet; the leaders of the world are now watching the stage with keen interest, and spiralling fear."
 USA_BLOOD_AND_IRON_DESC: "The United States has just won the Civil War against the CSA, leading to the abolition of slavery and military occupation of the South. A period of reconstruction and industrialization is at hand, with railroads beginning to cross the expanding country and cities growing in population.\n\nAll is not well, however. The devastation of the Civil War has left much of the country in shambles, and the Southerners are displeased with the current occupation as well as the rights granted to the newly free Black population. Furthermore, corruption and political instability threaten the livelihood of the United States."

 NOON_OF_EMPIRES_NAME: "Noon of Empires"
 NOON_OF_EMPIRES_DESC: "The rebirth of European power and pre-eminence on the world stage has reawakened the imperialist ambitions of a bygone age. As Europeans begin to contest one another over new colonial ventures destined to spread far and wide over the vast continents of Africa and Asia, the United States continues its aggressive expansion across North America fuelled by a rapidly expanding economy, as Latin America reaffirms their independence. Fantastic new technologies from inventors like Thomas Edison enlighten the globe like never before. In the East, new movements within China and Japan call for modernization and resistance, but it may be too late..."
