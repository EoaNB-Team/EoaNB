 #SUCCESSION AND FAMILY EVENTS
 rossiya.1.t: "Crown Prince Nicholas Dies"
 rossiya.1.d: "Your Highness, I am displeased to inform you of this terrible news. As you know your son and Crown Prince, Nicholas, has been touring Southern Europe in the past few weeks. However, during a trip to Italy he became ill and was rushed to Southern France to be cared for by skilled French doctors. He has just died of cerebro-spinal meningitis after worsening condition, resting on his bead at the Villa Bermond in Nice, France. His final reported words were that his fiancée is to marry to now Tsesarevich Alexander III, your now eldest son. That is all, Your Highness, I shall now leave you to grieve."
 rossiya.1.a: "The entire country mourns Prince Nicholas."
 rossiya.2.t: "Alexander II and His Mistress"
 rossiya.2.d: "Today, his Imperial highness married his beloved mistress, Catherine Dolgokurov. This has unfortunately displeased many courtiers, who have always held such a negative view against the Tsar's mistresses, but his highness loves her nonetheless. Those courtiers just need some convincing of Catherine’s good intentions."
 rossiya.2.a: "The courtiers will keep their mouths shut."
 rossiya.3.t: "Alexander III Marries Maria Feodorovna"
 rossiya.3.d: "Our Tsarevich Alexander, while on a visit to Copenhagen, asked Princess Dagmar of Denmark for her hand. Since then, their relationship has only gained momentum and on the 1st of September, 1866, Dagmar arrived in Kronstadt and was escorted to St. Petersburg in a chariot. On the 29th, she made her formal entry into the Russian capital dressed in a traditional Russian outfit and travelled with the Empress to the Winter Palace where she was introduced to the Russian public atop a balcony. Today she converted to orthodoxy, followed by a lavish wedding in the Imperial Chapel of the Winter Palace."
 rossiya.3.a: "Hail Tsesarevna Maria!"
 rossiya.4.t: "The Tsar's Safety"
 rossiya.4.d: "We fear for the Tsar's safety, as the repeated attacks on his life seem to suggest that a sizeable portion of the population want to see him dead. What should we suggest?"
 rossiya.4.a: "The Tsar must hold on!"
 rossiya.4.b: "The Tsar should abdicate in favor of his on."

 #STARTING EVENTS
 rossiya.11.t: "DEBUG: Hidden Russian Starting Event"
 rossiya.11.d: "Sets starting compliance in occupied states and AI strategies for the wars."
 rossiya.11.a: "HIDDEN"
 rossiya.12.t: "The Caucasian War"
 rossiya.12.d: "Since the beginning of this century we have fought for the subjugation of the Muslims living in the Caucasus area. While we have been successful in Georgia, where the population is Orthodox, we have failed so far in Circassia and Southern Dagestan. There the fierce tribals have resisted our civilizing attempts, and thousands of our men have perished. Our army has used wrong practices in confronting these savages, and we have approached the situation wrongly. The time has now come to mend our mistakes and to end this costly war once for all."
 rossiya.12.a: "Onwards to the Caucasus!"

 #ASSASSINATION EVENTS
 rossiya.16.t: "The Summer Garden"
 rossiya.16.d: "Alexander II leisurely paced through the picturesque Summer Garden, within the Palace Embankment in St. Petersburg. Unbeknownst to Alexander II and his entourage, a young revolutionary slipped through the crowd that had gathered around him at the gate of the St. Petersburg Summer Garden. In a desperate attempt, the revolutionary pulled out a double-barreled shotgun and trained his aim at the Emperor and fired.\n\nAlexander was still alive. Luckily, at just the right moment, the revolutionary's attempt was thwarted by the valiant interruption of no other than a peasant-born hatter's apprentice by the name of Ossip Komissarov, who jostled the revolutionary's arm just as he was about to fire.\n\nThe assailant, shocked by Komissarov, attempted to flee the scene, but he was immediately intercepted by the royal guard. Alexander approached the assailant, and angrily asked him 'What do you want?' The shocked assailant only mumbled back to him 'Nothing, nothing,' before being taken away.\n\nThe identity of the assailant has been revealed to be Dmitry Karakozov, a former student and a member of the revolutionary students' organization known as the Ishutin Circle."
 rossiya.16.a: "Punish him and his fellow revolutionaries harshly!"
 rossiya.19.t: "A Shot in Paris"
 rossiya.19.d: "While coming back from a military review during the Paris world fair with his two sons and French emperor Napoleon III, tsar Alexander was attacked by the polish nationalist, Antoni Berezowski, who fired a double-barrelled pistol at the Tsar. Thankfully the weapon broke, and the bullet deviated, hitting one of the guardsmen’s horses instead. Mr Berezowski was quickly arrested and declared that his motive was the liberation of his native Poland. His only regret is that he committed the deed in Poland-friendly France."
 rossiya.19.a: "In Paris?!"
 rossiya.21.t: "Shots at the Winter Palace"
 rossiya.21.d: "While taking his usual morning walk on the Winter Palace grounds, Alexander II encountered a man with a revolver in his hand. The Tsar quickly fled and ran in a zig zag pattern causing the student to miss all his five shots. He was overpowered by the police after a brief struggle and identified as Alexander Soloviev, a former student who had turned into a revolutionary. So strong was his beliefs that he had even swallowed poison while resisting his arrest but the doctors were able to revive him. All indications are that Soloviev acted on his own."
 rossiya.21.a: "Catch that criminal!"
 rossiya.23.t: "Attempt on the Emperors life - Train Bombing"
 rossiya.23.d: "There has been an attack on the railway line between Livadia on Crimea to Moscow. Thankfully no one has been injured but there are disturbing intelligence pointing out the Tsar’s train as the target."
 rossiya.23.a: "Tactical decisions..."
 rossiya.24.t: "Winter Palace Bombing"
 rossiya.24.d: "The Tsar had just welcomed his nephew to the Winter Palace when an explosion was heard. It soon became clear that a bomb had been planted in the guard room beneath the dining hall. A quick investigation has revealed that a newly hired carpenter had planted the bomb and disappeared. Remnants of the bomb showed that it was a timed device and that it was rigged to explode at the time when the Tsar usually sat down for dinner. The nephews’ arrival had delayed the Tsar and thanks to god saved his life."
 rossiya.24.a: "How did he even get the job there?!"
 rossiya.26.t: "Ekaterininskiy Canal Incident"
 rossiya.26.d: "On the afternoon of 13 March, after having watched the manoeuvres of two Guard battalions at the Manège, the Tsar's carriage, changed many routes by the way,  had gone about 150 yards down the quay of Catherine Chanel until it encountered narodnikist terrorist Nikolai Rysakov who was carrying a bomb wrapped in a handkerchief.\n\nOn the signal being given by terrorist organiser Sophia Perovskaya, Rysakov threw the bomb under the Tsar's carriage. The Cossack who rode behind was mortally wounded, a fourteen year old peasant boy who served as a delivery boy in a butcher's shop was brutally injured too. However, the explosion had only damaged the bulletproof carriage. The emperor emerged shaken but unhurt.\n\nRysakov was captured almost immediately. Police Chief Dvorzhitsky heard Rysakov shout out to someone else in the gathering crowd. The coachman implored the Emperor not to alight. Dvorzhitzky offered to drive the Tsar back to the Palace in his sleigh. The Tsar agreed…"
 rossiya.26.a: "...but decided to first see the culprit, and to survey the damage."
 rossiya.26.b: "...and immediately returned to the Winter Palace."
 rossiya.27.t: "Death of Alexander II"
 rossiya.27.d: "Tsar was ready to drive away when a second bomber, Hryniewiecki, who had come close to the Tsar, made a sudden movement, throwing a bomb at his feet. A second explosion ripped through the air and the Emperor and his assassin fell to the ground, both mortally injured. Since people had crowded close to the Tsar, Hryniewiecki's bomb claimed more injuries than the first.\n\nAlexander was carried by sleigh to his study in the Winter Palace, where almost the same day twenty years earlier, he had signed the Emancipation Edict freeing the serfs. Members of the Romanov family came rushing to the scene. The dying emperor was given Communion and Last rites. When the attending physician, Sergey Botkin, was asked how long it would be, he replied, "Up to fifteen minutes." At 3:30 that day, the personal flag of Alexander II was lowered for the last time."
 rossiya.27.a: "All of Russia mourns the Tsar's passing."

 #Terrorism and such
 rossiya.30.t: ""Zemlya i Volya""
 rossiya.30.d: "The spread of the ideas of Narodnikism in Russia led to the creation of numerous underground circles aimed at putting these ideas into practice. Zemlya i Volya (Land and Liberty) became one of them. Organized under the influence of the ideas of the publicists Herzen, Ogarev and Chernyshevsky, "Zemlya i Volya" appears to be engaged in the creation of a network of circles whose purpose is to overthrow the autocracy and establish Narodnikism. "
 rossiya.30.a: "We must keep an eye on them."
 rossiya.31.t: "Chernyshevsky's arrest"
 rossiya.31.d: ""Sovremennik" literature magazine writer Nikolai Chernyshevsky is arrested for distributing a proclamation to peasants intended to stir up revolutionary sentiments among them. Although there is no direct evidence that the proclamation was drafted by him, it is known that Chernyshevsky is one of the apologists for Narodnikism, makes considerable efforts to turn the Sovremennik, which he edits, into a revolutionary tribune and, apparently, has ties with underground members of Zemlya i Volya. What should the investigation do with him?"
 rossiya.31.a: "His activities are dangerous to the Fatherland. To hell with the evidence, send him to Siberia!"
 rossiya.31.b: "It's unthinkable to accuse a man without evidence! We only have to establish surveillance on him and his associates."
 rossiya.32.t: "The dissolution of "Zemlya i Volya""
 rossiya.32.d: "Good news at last! Judging by the information of the gendarmes, the Narodnik organization "Zemlya i Volya" has ceased to exist. Hoping for the success of the Polish uprising and all-Russian peasant revolts, the grief-stricken revolutionaries waited for neither, and, to all appearances, were disappointed in their cause. Although they were not the only ones, the collapse of a large enough organization would clearly contribute to the decline in popularity of Narodnikism."
 rossiya.32.a: "Good."
 rossiya.33.t: "Ishutin Circle Trial"
 rossiya.33.d: "After an attempt to assassinate the Tsar, thanks to the captured Karakozov, the gendarmes managed to catch most of the Ishutinsk circle - an organization in which the attacker participated. Inspired by the works of Chernyshevsky, the organization aimed to propagate the socialist way of life and terror, which should lead to revolution. As a result of the trial, the members of the circle went to jail, and Karakozov was sent to the gallows."
 rossiya.33.a: "Interesting."
 rossiya.34.t: "Execution of the First Russian Terrorist"
 rossiya.34.d: "Today, Dmitry Karakozov, the first Russian terrorist, was hanged on the Smolensk field of St. Petersburg's Vasilevsky Island in a large crowd. Aspiring artist Ilya Repin, who was present at the execution, drew up a sketch of Karakozov in front of the scaffold."
 rossiya.34.a: "He became the first of many."
 rossiya.35.t: "Government Reaction"
 rossiya.35.d: "The recent incidents have raised confusion in the government. Incomprehensible fires in the capital, the spread of revolutionary ideas in society and an attempted regicide convinced many officials and conservative figures that the reforms carried out by the Tsar had gone somewhere wrong. The conservative part of the establishment insists on a change in the course of reforms, the resignation of the liberal Minister of Education Golovnin, accused of all the troubles, and a revision of attitudes towards education, censorship and local self-government. The tsar is an autocrat and it is up to him to choose whether to listen to the conservatives or continue to support the liberal bureaucratic "Konstantinovites"."
 rossiya.35.a: "The officials are right, the reforms have gone too far"
 rossiya.35.b: "The officials themselves are to blame for many of our troubles, we will continue our reforms!"
 rossiya.36.t: ""People's Reprisal Society""
 rossiya.36.d: "Information reached the Section III about the emergence of another underground revolutionary organization. The " People's Reprisal Society", organized, apparently, by the revolutionary activist and author of the odious "Catechism of the Revolutionary" Sergei Nechaev, aims at conspiratorial preparation for the revolution and terror. Judging by the known data, the organization has a truly Jacobin dictatorship and discipline, so it will not be easy to detect."
 rossiya.36.a: "We need to keep an eye on them."
 rossiya.37.t: "Murder case of student Ivanov I."
 rossiya.37.d: "Crime story: student Ivanov Ivan was found murdered in the grotto of the Petrovskaya Academy. The investigation revealed that the murdered man was a member of the "Society of People's Reprisal" and was killed by its head Sergei Nechaev because of disagreements in the conduct of revolutionary activities. The revolutionaries, as it turned out, kept detailed documentation of all their activities, which gave the investigators who discovered the safe house all the trump cards. As a result of the high-profile case, four participants in the murder and the organization were sentenced to prison terms, although Nechaev himself managed to escape to Switzerland."
 rossiya.37.a: "No country for an old man"
 rossiya.38.t: "Reunification of "Zemlya i Volya""
 rossiya.38.d: "Information has reached the Section III that the formerly dissolved Narodnik organization "Zemlya i Volya" is functioning again. The organization, whose members are students Mikhailov, Plekhanov, Natanson and others, has changed its tactics and now operates with slogans about land and will that are closer to the people. The revolutionaries, to all appearances, have decided to take a firm hold of the countryside, sending their members there to agitate the peasants. Although the peasants do not seem to listen particularly to the urban intellectuals and their stories, the rebirth of a large revolutionary organization is a cause for concern."
 rossiya.38.a: "We need to keep an eye on them."
 rossiya.39.t: "Kazanskaya Square Demonstration"
 rossiya.39.d: "A serious incident occurred in the capital: after the service in honor of the day of St. Nicholas, more than a hundred students and workers came to the square in front of the Kazan Cathedral and began to shout narodnikist slogans and demand land and liberty. Among the organizers of the demonstration was the student Plekhanov, suspected of participating in "Zemlya i Volya". Although the action ended up being small and there were many more students than workers, the precedent for working-class political action emerged."
 rossiya.39.a: "We need to arest the organisers immediately!"
 rossiya.40.t: "The Case of Propaganda in the Empire"
 rossiya.40.d: "In front of the eyes of the capital's citizens and reporters who arrived from many European countries, a grandiose "trial of one hundred and two-three" unfolded - a trial of narodnikists arrested on suspicion of revolutionary propaganda. Several thousand suspects have already spent long terms in prisons, the actions of the investigation, which threw them behind bars on the slightest suspicion, are subjected to terrible condemnations of society and the press.\n\nIn the end, several dozen people were sentenced to hard labor and prisons, and most of the suspects were released. However, the radical public has become angry because of the careless and too harsh conduct of the case and, apparently, will soon move on to increasingly bloody actions."
 rossiya.40.a: "Clouds are gathering over the empire"
 rossiya.41.t: "Split of Zemlya i Volya"
 rossiya.41.d: "The news reached the Section III. The narodnikist organization "Zemlya i Volya" after its last congress in Voronezh, apparently, is disintegrating. The reason for this is disagreement on the methods of conducting the revolutionary struggle. There is little good, since the organization does not disappear, but only splits, the radicals, led by Mikhailov, form the "Freedom or Death", the moderates, led by Plekhanov, go to the "Black Repartition", advocating for peaceful agitation. In any case, the organization should continue to be monitored."
 rossiya.41.a: "Interesting."
 rossiya.42.t: ""Narodnaya Volya""
 rossiya.42.d: "Information reaches Section III that the split radical part of the Land and Liberty has finally taken shape in a new organization - Narodnaya Volya (Popular Will). Consisting of many revolutionaries, among them supposely Zhelyabin, Mikhailov, Perovskaya, Tikhomirov and others, the organization sets itself the goal of disorganizing the work of the government by all means and leading to the overthrow of the regime. This time, as a result of disappointment in the agitation among the peasants and amid irritation from the "Case of Propaganda in the Empire", Narodnaya Volya is going to focus on terror, so we need to triple our vigilance."
 rossiya.42.a: "We need to keep an eye on them."
 rossiya.43.t: "Assassination attempt on the mayor of St. Petersburg"
 rossiya.43.d: "On January 24, 1877, the St. Petersburg mayor Fyodor Trepov ordered the flogging of the political prisoner Narodnik Bogolyubov for not taking off his hat to him. Trepov's order for flogging was a violation of the law on the prohibition of corporal punishment of April 17, 1863. Today, during another reception, Vera Zasulich came into his office and shot the mayor, hitting him in the side. She was immediately arrested and, during interrogation, the shooter stated that she had done it in revenge for the flogging of Bogolyubov. Her case will be heard by a jury."
 rossiya.43.a: "I have bad feeling about this"
 rossiya.44.t: "Jury trial over Vera Zasulich"
 rossiya.44.d: "A high-profile trial of Vera Zasulich took place in St. Petersburg. Due to the mild speech of the prosecution and thanks to the brilliant defense of lawyer Aleksandrov, who pointed out to the jury the nobleness of Zasulich's motive, avenging the official for lawlessness, as well as Judge Anatoly Koni's obvious sympathy for the accused, Zasulich was found not guilty. In the press, both domestic and foreign, the process caused a success, the liberal public is enthusiastic, the conservative public is indignant. The process obviously did not go according to our plan, should we cause any consequences for its participants?"
 rossiya.44.a: "The judge acted tendentiously. Transfer him to a less prestigious position."
 rossiya.44.b: "The judge did what he was supposed to do."
 rossiya.45.t: "Consequences of the Zasulich case"
 rossiya.45.d: "Jury trial of Vera Zasulich caused serious changes in public sentiment. Angry over past narodnikists trials and seeing seemingly public support for violent methods, radical youth are increasingly leaning towards terrorist methods. The Section III expects that many will decide to repeat the act of Zasulich and, apparently, the victims will no longer be avoided."
 rossiya.45.a: "We must stay vigilant."
 rossiya.46.t: "1878 Report on Revolutionary Terror"
 rossiya.46.d: "The Section III prepared a disappointing report on the situation with revolutionary terror in the country. This year there is a real wave of terror. So, in Odessa, a member of "Zemlya i Volya" Grigory Popko stabbed the adjutant of the Kiev provincial gendarmerie department, Baron Gustav von Geiking, in Kiev, attempts were made on the Kiev prosecutor Kotlyarevsky and an agent of the detective police Nikonov, in St. Petersburg, the chief of the gendarmes Mezentsev was stabbed to death by a member of the Zemlya i Volya Kravchinsky. In addition, there have been dozens of smaller and less high-profile attacks across the country."
 rossiya.46.a: "Concerning."
 rossiya.47.t: "1879 Report on Revolutionary Terror"
 rossiya.47.d: "The Section III prepared a disappointing report on the situation with revolutionary terror in the country. This year, terrorist acts have not declined. At the Winter Palace and on the way from Odessa to St. Petersburg, two attempts were made on the life of Tsar Alexander II. In addition, in Kharkov, the Governor-General Prince Kropotkin was killed by the Zemlya i Volya terrorist Grigoriy Goldenberg. In addition, there have been dozens of smaller and less high-profile attacks across the country."
 rossiya.47.a: "Concerning."


 #GENERAL INFO AND FLAVOUR EVENTS
 rossiya.51.t: "The Crimean War"
 rossiya.51.d: "The Crimean War was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to February 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain, and Sardinia. The war started in the Balkans in July 1853, when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities, which were under Ottoman suzerainty, then began to cross the Danube. Led by Omar Pasha, the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the advance at Silistra. The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts in which the military used modern technologies such as explosive naval shells, railways, and telegraphs. The war was one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and photographs. As the legend of the "Charge of the Light Brigade" demonstrates, the war quickly became an iconic symbol of logistical, medical and tactical failures and mismanagement."
 rossiya.51.a: "We'll have to do something"
 rossiya.52.t: "The Second Italian War of Independence"
 rossiya.52.d: "The Second Italian war of independence has resulted in a defeat for Russia’s arch-rival Austria. Although there is, as yet no independent Italian nation the Austrian influence over the Italian peninsula has been severely weakened, perhaps permanently so. There is clearly a new power eager to step into Austria’s shoes; The Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont. It has played its cards well so far by allying with another of Austria’s arch-rivals, France. Maybe Russia could play a hand in here as well?"
 rossiya.52.a: "Interesting."
 rossiya.53.t: "The Gorky Library is Established"
 rossiya.53.d: "Our Great Nation is filled with many illiterates, especially and obviously amongst the peasants and the poor. Establishing public libraries has been deemed important by Tsar Alexander II and even some in the previous Cabinet of Tsar Nicholas I, to help educate our Serfs. However, during the majority of the rule of Nicholas I, the Russian Imperial government lacked the funds to construct any public library whatsoever, so it was not until today that the first public library in the oblast of Ryazan was built, the Gorky Library. Being based in the populated and influential city of Gorky, it was the clear choice, also in part thanks to the many wealthy and educated patrons funding the project."
 rossiya.53.a: "Perhaps a stop by?"
 rossiya.54.t: "Kyiv Police Department"
 rossiya.54.d: "The city of Kyiv, in the Malorossiya region, has been growing rapidly and soon becoming a hassle to control without an official commissioned police to enforce the basic laws. Therefore, by decree of the Emperor early today, the Kyiv Municipal Police Department has been formed with the headquarters based at Number 15, Voldymyr Street."
 rossiya.54.a: "Great job!"
 rossiya.55.t: "St. Isaac's Cathedral Completed"
 rossiya.55.d: "After 40 years of construction and countless hours of planning, the beautiful Saint Isaac's Cathedral has been finalized in St.Petersburg. The cathedral was ordered by Alexander I to start construction 1818, and is the fourth church built on St. Isaac's Square. The Cathedral and Square gained their name from Saint Isaac of Dalmatia, a patron saint of Peter the Great, who had been born on the feast day of that saint. The cathedral took 1,000,000 gold rubles to complete, tanking the Imperial coffers, but the wait and money spent was merit."
 rossiya.55.a: "Glory to god! Glory to Russia!"
 rossiya.56.t: "International Red Cross"
 rossiya.56.d: "Your Excellency, dozens of countries across Europe, major and minor alike, have gathered in Geneva, Switzerland to discuss the formation of the International Red Cross; 36 individuals: eighteen official delegates from national governments, six delegates from other non-governmental organizations, seven non-official foreign delegates, and the five members of the International Committee. Among the many proposals written in the final resolution, some references include: Neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers, the foundation of national relief for the wounded, and international humanitarian law to protect the life and dignity of the victims of international and internal armed conflicts."
 rossiya.56.a: "Interesting..."
 rossiya.58.t: "Epoch Magazine Goes Public"
 rossiya.58.d: "The great writer and imperial advocate, Fyodor Dostoevsky, has begun publishing epoch magazine with his brother Mikhail. The first publication has just come out containing the opening chapters of Notes from Underground, a Dostoevsky novel. We faithfully request you read it, Your Highness, it is an excellent piece of literary work."
 rossiya.58.a: "I will, indeed, read it"
 rossiya.59.t: "New Michael Palace Complete"
 rossiya.59.d: "The grand New Michael Palace has been completed after a grueling five years of construction. Designed by the great architect Andrei Stackenschneider and built on the palace embankment in St. Petersburg, the palace is meant for the numerous children of the late Nicholas I. The palace is extravagant and represents the wealth of our country very well, boasting about our riches and architectural accomplishments. That is all for now, Your Highness."
 rossiya.59.a: "What a great piece of architecture"
 rossiya.60.t: "Nazranov Rebellion"
 rossiya.60.d: "Our plans of forcing the local population in Ingushetia to move to bigger settlements and forbidding the local tribesmen to wear their traditional knifes has caused an open rebellion.

 rossiya.60.a: "Those pesky Caucasians..."
 rossiya.61.t: "Nazranov Rebellion"
 rossiya.61.d: "Our plans of forcing the local population in Ingushetia to move to bigger settlements and forbidding the local tribesmen to wear their traditional knifes has caused an open rebellion.

 rossiya.62.t: "Riga Technical University"
 rossiya.62.d: "The first poly technical institute of our empire will be established in the city of Riga. Since Russia don’t have enough lecturers of its own yet, the first lecturers will come from  Austria-Hungary, Germany and Switzerland and all courses will therefore be in German. Here Russian students could study architecture, agriculture, chemistry, engineering, mechanical engineering and trade. "
 rossiya.62.a: "Development in the Baltic is always welcome."

 rossiya.63.d: "We have received news from our province of Armenia that a local businessman and philanthropist by the name of Harutyun Khalibyan, has decided to financially help the local orthodox church in its endeavour to open a local school for Armenian youths.

 rossiya.63.a: "Time to educate the Armenians."
 rossiya.64.t: "South Ussuriysk Border Commissariat"
 rossiya.64.d: "The border between Russia and China has been badly controlled and has made it easier for individuals with ill intentions to enter Russia. To remedy this, the governor general of Eastern Siberia has proposed that one of the border post in the South Ussuri territory should be upgraded to a border Comissariat under the direct control of the interior ministry. This commissariat should be staffed with a Commisar, a Russo-Chinese interpreter, a Russo-Korean interpreter and various support staff. The commissariat will work with the Chinese authorities in preventing unwanted indiviuals to enter Russia while also compensating for the lack of Russian consulate offices in Manchuria."
 rossiya.64.a: "We need a firm stand in the Far East."
 rossiya.65.t: "Sevastopol Biological Station"
 rossiya.65.d: "Following a request from Russian scientist the first marine biological station in Russia, and the third in Europe, will be established in Sevastopol, Crimea. The hope is that it will help streamlining the scientific research of the flora and fauna of the Black Sea."

The factory is located in the village of Zarozhany, Bessarabia, an area where almost one in five of the farmers doesn’t own the land they are living on, and poverty is widespread. These conditions should make it easy to find labour despite the hard-working conditions in the factory. The factory would also benefit from and to the local farmers buy buying the increasing amount of sugar beets that were farmed in the area."
 rossiya.66.a: "The peasants need new employment."
 rossiya.67.t: "First Ukrainian Discourse Theatre Established in Lviv"

 rossiya.68.t: "Meeting with Pedro II of Brazil"
 rossiya.68.d: "In the 18th century, Russian sailors on internship on British ships, visited Brazil. This was the first contact between the two countries, but so far only at the domestic level. Diplomatic relations between Russia and Brazil were officially established six years after Brazil's independence, in 1828. Brazil became the first country in Latin America, which was recognized by the Russian Empire. From that moment onward Brazil began to actively cooperate with Russia: Brazilian export products (coffee, sugar, and spices) began to arrive in Russia, the first Russian expedition to Brazil was carried out, and in 1867 the Brazilian Emperor Pedro II even visited Russia. Although the visit was informal, Pedro II visited the capital of the Russian Empire, St. Petersburg, as well as Kiev and Livadia, where he met the Romanov family, who were vacationing there."
 rossiya.68.a: "An opportunity for the fostering of relations?"
 rossiya.69.t: "Russian Musical Society"
 rossiya.69.d: "Russians are no different than the rest of the civilized world in that we love music. Sadly, the only way for Russian musical talent to get any kind of training is through private lessons. Because of this there are very few professional Russian musicians, conductors and composers. Which is why the founding of the Russian Musical Society by Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna and her protegé, pianist and composer Anton Rubinstein is such a wonderful idea. The goal of the society is to open up musical education to all students. Thereby increasing the number of professional Russian musicians and performers and raising the standard of music in the Russian empire. Soon Russians can watch concerts performed by Russian musicians performing songs written by Russian composers."
 rossiya.69.a: "Let's raise the standard of music in our country."
 rossiya.70.t: "Trams in Warsaw"
 rossiya.70.d: "Our militaries wish to not build a railway over the Vistula river in Warsaw is causing unnecessary traffic congestions with separate train stations on both sides of the river. As long as the military persists we will have to come up with other solutions to ease the traveling in Warsaw, hence the opening of horse driven trams between the stations, at least the army has no objection about trams crossing the bridges over the Vistula."
 rossiya.70.a: "This will aid the city's development."
 rossiya.71.t: "Bratnia Pomoc"

 rossiya.201.t: "Germans Immigrate To The Volga Region"
 rossiya.201.d: "Over the past few months, the Russian Empire has seen a substantial amount of German migrants settling in the Volga Region east of Moscow. While the Tsars and their advisors have traditionally been sceptical of foreigners immigrating into their feudal nation, as Serfdom becomes less reliable, these new Germanic vagrants could prove quite useful in developing and modernizing our nation in the coming years."
 rossiya.201.a: "We shall make good use of them!"
 rossiya.202.t: "New Minister of War Appointed"
 rossiya.202.d: "It wasn't a long time ago, since enemy forces invaded our motherland, the first time since the Napoleonic Wars! Our army fought bravely but this time we lost. Now we have to consider new reforms to improve it. \n\nAfter the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, the Minister of War, Count Dmitry Milyutin, (who held the post from 16 May 1861 to 21 May 1881) introduced many much-needed reforms. The reforms carried on during Milyutin's long tenure abolished the system where children were conscripted and resulted in the levy system being introduced in Russia and military districts being created across the country. The system of military education was also reformed, and elementary education was made available to all the draftees. Milyutin's reforms are regarded as a milestone in the history of Russia: they dispensed with the military recruitment and professional army introduced by Peter the Great and created the Russian army as it continued into the 21st century. Up to Dmitry Milyutin's reforms in 1874, the Russian Army had no permanent barracks and was billeted in dugouts and shacks."

 rossiya.203.a: "Long may he reign!"
 rossiya.221.t: "The Great Reforms and Russian Establishment"
 rossiya.221.d: "The Great Reforms conceived by Alexander II should change almost every aspect of Russian life. Changes are coming in the judicial, administrative, financial, educational and, most importantly, peasant spheres. However, like many reformers in history, the sovereign may find that his great transformations in practice turn out to be faded. It all depends on how much the establishment of the Russian State at all its levels will favor the reforms. \n\nThe nobles and many officials are distrustful of any changes and, unless the Tsar insists otherwise, the reforms will be only superficial. However, if the Tsar has enough pressure and can overcome the resistance of the conservatives and give way to progressive forces, it will be possible to implement truly colossal reforms. \n\nIt all depends entirely on you, Your Highness."

 rossiya.209.t: "The Russian European Empire"
 rossiya.209.d: "Over the past few centuries, The Russian Empire has greatly expanded its borders and during the recent major conflicts most of its gains were made in Europe. Our most westward territories are home to the Polish. A catholic nation, which isn't afraid to fight for its independence. Their homeland is also inhabited by Germans and Jews. To the north lies Finland, a protestant country with a rising national identity. The Baltic Sea coastline is inhabited by Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians, and also by Germans, which have lived here since the times of the Livonian Order.

 rossiya.212.t: "Mahtra Estate Revolt"
 rossiya.212.d: "Though the Russian Baltic hasn't seen serfdom since its abolishment in 1816, peasant unrest is high even in this region. It has been slowly boiling since the Manifesto of Tsar Alexander II from March 19 1856, when larger agrarian reforms were promised but implementation was slow, and now peasants from the Mahtra estate in Estonia are in rebellion against our rule! Troops were sent to restore order..."
 rossiya.212.a: "What? A peasant revolt? Are we in Pugachev's times again?"
 rossiya.213.t: "Mahtra Revolt Ends"
 rossiya.213.d: "Nearly two months ago, unrest among the peasantry caused a rebellion against the Tsar on the Mahtra estate of the Estonian governorate. It has been handled by the regular garrison army, resulting in 14 wounded and seven casualites, three of the wounded peasants died while in hospital. The battle did not go without our own loss: our company suffered some casualties — 13 wounded soldiers and one officer killed. 60 of the 65 peasant prisoners were sentenced to death by our court-martial in Tallinn, although the Baltic governor-general Suvorov will likely reduce most of these sentences to corporal punishment, or to leave to Siberia in exile. This revolt was crushed easily by our army, but we need to be on the lookout for insurrections in the future."

We have replaced the governor of Kazan to make sure that something like this will never happen again."

 rossiya.215.d: "While Victor Hugo's book 'Les Miserables' is a masterpiece even read by monarchs all over the world, it should not be shown to the public eye now that it is translated, your highness. Reading the book may give those foolish peasants the wrong idea if you know what I mean. -All of Alexander II's Advisors."
 rossiya.215.a: "Ignorance is Strength"
 rossiya.216.t: "What is to be Done?"
 rossiya.216.d: "The book 'What is to be Done?' by the radical writer Nikolai Chernyshevsky was smuggled out of the great fortress of St. Peter and Paul where he lays imprisoned. The novel mentions the outlandish ideas of collective farms owned by the peasants, as if we would allow something like this to ever happen. Don't worry your highness, we'll make sure to suppress these revolutionary ideas before the word spreads to the masses. We should also deal with Socialist Philosopher Chernyshevsky, his ideals are spreading quickly to the peoples, becoming a nuisance on our stability.."

 rossiya.218.t: "Censoring 'Fathers and Sons'?"
 rossiya.218.d: "'Russian Bulletin' has sent its new March-April issue to the Censor Department. That would be a usual publication if it hadn't the new Turgenev's novel inside, called 'Fathers and Sons'. Its idea is rotating around nihilism, an ideology of denial of every authority and even somewhat revolutionary! It can be dangerous enough for our aristocracy which already supports liberal ideas. We can give the order - and this book will be completely different, but Turgenev will be completely disappointed in our government. He is one of the most loyal writers of our Motherland and it would be a tall loss. But what if we go soft with this novel and just let it be? Of course, there will be some mimics who will call themselves 'nihilists', but... isn't it what we want to make them think? Just ensure that they are loyal, being initiative and innovative isn't a crime in Russia."
 rossiya.218.a: "Let's not be strict, it's not the Nikolay era after all."
 rossiya.218.b: "Better censure this 'Nihilism', else we can suffer from crazy idealists raised on that book..."

 rossiya.219.d: "When the novel about Evgeniy Bazarov has just been written by Turgenev, we decided to censor it heavily, remove all questionable themes and never return to this. But due to the end of the Censor Department, following the new law about the press, the real book has been revealed! Now people are blaming us for hiding that 'masterpiece' from them. That led to us losing some positions in government and, what is worrying - 'nihilism' starts to spread through our population!"
 rossiya.219.a: "What a shame..."
 rossiya.220.t: "Publishment of 'Crime and Punishment'"
 rossiya.220.d: "Fyodor Dostoevsky has written a new book, called 'Crime and Punishment'. It tells about a poor Russian student, Rodion Raskolnikov, who tries to survive in Saint Petersburg and lends his fathers silver wristwatch to the old woman, who was a money lender. He says that this is unfair and kills her along with her silly-minded sister and then tries to merge his philosophy theory about 'the ones who have the right and the ones who don't' with the fact of murder. When he founds his love and starts a more active life, meeting many people, his conscience begins to rise slowly, leading him to surrendering to police and going to penal colony in Siberia. His love follows him and there he finally finds his salvation, throws out his ideas and starts a new life with his woman. This book, being published now in the 'Russian Bulletin', is close to the title of masterpiece and doesn't really tell about any political ideas, so we can just let it be."
 rossiya.220.a: "Worth of reading in spare time - Dostoevsky wrote a good piece!"
 rossiya.231.t: "Fate of Prikaz of Public Charity"
 rossiya.231.d: "The Prikaz of Public Charity is a provincial institution introduced in Russia by Catherine II in 1775, which was in charge of managing public schools, hospitals, asylums for the sick and insane, hospitals, almshouses and prisons. Funding for these institutions came from several sources at once, among other things from interest on government bonds to repay debts, fines, government subsidies, and so on. Due to the complex funding structure, these institutions were poorly and inefficiently supplied, which affected their performance. With the transfer of the functions of the prikaz to the newly created zemstvos and other institutions, there is no longer a need for it and they will be abolished along with organizations in the provinces of the zemstvos, which will improve the efficiency of public services and reduce the burden of the treasury."

 rossiya.267.d: "For the better work of the zemstvos, its representatives began to carry out zemstvo statistics - statistical work to survey mainly the state of agriculture and the processes of its socio-economic development. Such studies are carried out on the initiative of the zemstvos in connection with the need for materials on the value and profitability of land and other real estate for the correct distribution of zemstvo duties, as well as to collect information about the food needs of the population. Sometimes the purpose of zemstvo statistics is to collect information about the needs in education, health care, the volume of regional industry and trade. Thanks to these, of course, unique works, our knowledge about our own land is multiplying, which significantly improves the country's manageability."
 rossiya.267.a: "The more you know"
 rossiya.268.t: "Zemstvo Insurance"
 rossiya.268.d: "The Regulation on Mutual Zemstvo Insurance, approved in 1864, became the legal basis for zemstvo insurance. Each provincial zemstvo carries out insurance operations within its own gubernia. Insurance is under the jurisdiction of the provincial assembly, which determines all nuances following the insurance process. In addition, the provincial assembly approved insurance instructions for administrations, volost administrations and agents, disposed of insurance funds, and considered reports from provincial administrations. The executive body was the provincial zemstvo council. Zemstvo insurance of buildings against fire was divided into mandatory and voluntary. All rural buildings, both private and public, which are located in the Pale of Settlement, are subject to compulsory insurance. All other buildings are subject to zemstvo insurance only at the request of the owner."
 rossiya.268.a: "Is the house on fire? To hell with it! I have insurance, I will return all the money in full!"
 rossiya.252.t: "Zemstvo Education"
 rossiya.252.d: "As part of the zemstvo reform, the zemstvos were given the opportunity to promote education in the countryside. It is assumed that zemstvo assemblies will finance rural primary schools, which will teach basic literacy and arithmetic. The organizational order and legislative base is yet to be developed, but it seems that the new organization of rural education will significantly improve the situation with literacy in the village."
 rossiya.252.a: "Back to school desks."
 rossiya.233.t: "Regulation of Public Primary Schools"
 rossiya.233.d: "To regulate the work of zemstvo schools, the Regulations on Primary Public Schools were issued. According to them, the zemstvo school was a three or four-year educational institution, where one teacher taught basic literacy subjects: reading, writing, the Law of God and church singing. Children of all classes studied in these schools and, in the vast majority of cases, for free. Schools were maintained by zemstvos and were under the control of officials of the Ministry of Public Education - directors and inspectors of elementary schools. The financing of schools was joint, carried out at the expense of rural communities and volosts, zemstvos and the state. To manage the schools, gubernia school councils were created from representatives of various departments and zemstvos, chaired by the diocesan bishop, and uezd school councils from several officials and district zemstvos, who independently elected the chairman."
 rossiya.233.a: "Back to school desks."
 rossiya.234.t: "New Regulation of Public Primary Schools"
 rossiya.234.d: "Results of education expansion by zemstvos in recent years were mild, so further actions to improve zemstvo schooling were implemented. New Regulations on Primary Public Schools added little to the educational process itself, only limiting the maximum age of girls studying together with boys to 12 and establishing Russian as the compulsory language of education, in the same time changed organisational structure. Now both gubernia and uezd school councils are chaired with corresponding aristocracy leader, which, due to their wealth and authority for local level, will improve administration efficiency. In addition, the government will further motivate zemstvos to establish new schools."
 rossiya.234.a: "Back to school desks."
 rossiya.235.t: "Zemstvo Post"
 rossiya.235.d: "Postal communication outside the big cities is rudimentarily developed in Russia. In connection with the expanding activities of the zemstvos, their own zemstvo post began to emerge, which is used for the needs of areas not covered by state mail. By imposing additional duties for the use of state mail by zemstvos, an incentive was given to the development of zemstvo mail. Although a number of restrictions were imposed on it, Zemstvo postmen are significantly expanding and accelerating the exchange of correspondence in our vast country."
 rossiya.235.a: ""Why was I so angry? This is because I didn't have my own mail!""
 rossiya.236.t: "Zemstvo Stamp Law"
 rossiya.236.d: "To ensure the operations of the zemstvo mail, the zemstvos received the right to issue their own postage stamps. The only condition of the government is the obligatory difference of zemstvo postage stamps from any state ones. By no means all counties enjoy the right to print their own stamps, but many have already developed their own special stamp design styles."
 rossiya.236.a: "50 cent mark, please."
 rossiya.269.t: "Zemstvo Medicine"
 rossiya.269.d: "As part of the zemstvo reform, zemstvos received the opportunity (gradually turning into a duty) to provide medical care to the population. At first, zemstvo medicine is a doctor hired by the zemstvo, living in the city, part of the week traveling around the surrounding villages, the other part serving patients at home. Considerable assistance to zemstvo doctors is provided by medical societies, such as the Society of Russian Doctors or regional medical societies. Thanks to zemstvo medicine and statistics, the study of the health and diseases of the population is significantly expanding, which increases the effectiveness of public health. However, it is too early to talk about the full coverage of the rural population with quality health care."
 rossiya.269.a: ""First seeds of healthcare""
 rossiya.270.t: "Zemstvo Healthcare Law"
 rossiya.270.d: "In order to improve health care in the countryside, new regulations on zemstvo medicine were adopted. The travelling doctor was replaced by a stationary principle, according to which the counties were divided into medical districts, in which a hospital with an outpatient clinic, 1–2 medical assistants' stations and a pharmacy were opened. Hospitals provided universal treatment, for both acute and chronic diseases, to all populations. Although it is supposed to pay for the provision of services, the increasing Zemstvo appropriations are gradually reducing this payment to nothing. For better sanitary control, zemstvo medical statistics are being expanded, and a sanitary branch of medicine is emerging. Zemstvo medicine is assisted by numerous organisations, councils, medical institutes, and so on."
 rossiya.270.a: ""It hurts, but a little bit better…""
 rossiya.286.t: "Further Expanded Zemstvo Powers"
 rossiya.286.d: "In order to improve administration efficiency in our vast Empire and to learn our subjects about resposible governmentship, we will further expand powers of Zemstvos. This will include not only expantion of administrative duties and powers of such institutions in their jurisdiction, but devolution of governmental control too. This way the people of Russia will find out about hardship of government and free themselves from utopian radical ideas, created by people who never administered nothing."
 rossiya.286.a: "Let our subjects learn to govern themself"
 rossiya.264.t: "Establishment of District Courts"
 rossiya.264.d: "As part of the judicial reform, district courts were organized, serving several counties and consisting of crown judges. The court consists of several departments, which include four judges each. These courts single-handedly considered all cases more serious than cases for magistrates, but less serious than those requiring a jury. Thanks to the irremovability of judges and the separation of the courts from the executive, the courts have become more independent and the judiciary more efficient."
 rossiya.264.a: "Next case."
 rossiya.222.t: "New Judicial Statutes adopted"
 rossiya.222.d: "The fundamental documents of the Judicial Reform are the Judicial Statutes: the Statute on the Establishment of Judicial Places, the Statute of Criminal Proceedings, the Statute of Civil Procedure, the Statute on Punishments Imposed by Justices of the Peace. Based on these documents, the reform will be implemented. One of the key features of such Statues is implementation of complete separation of judicial bodies from any other body, be it administration or estate."
 rossiya.222.a: "Justice will be done."
 rossiya.223.t: "Magistrates’ Court Established"
 rossiya.223.d: "To resolve petty disputes and cases at the grassroots level, magistrates' courts were created, consisting of one elected justice of the peace. He single-handedly resolves issues and makes decisions that can be challenged on appeal - at the provincial congress of justices of the peace. The cassation body is one of the committees of the Governing Senate. Magistrates' courts make it possible to relieve professional judges and speed up the process of clarifying issues."
 rossiya.223.a: "Next case."
 rossiya.265.t: "Criminal Investigation Reform"
 rossiya.265.d: "For a long time, the criminal investigation in Russia was represented by the same people, who were often judged. This made the litigation subjective and inefficient. From now on, the investigation will be divided into a police investigation, which collects evidence, and a separate judicial investigation, which examines the legality of the evidence found. Thus, the criminal investigation became more objective and effective."
 rossiya.265.a: "Next case."
 rossiya.224.t: "The Jury Trial"
 rossiya.224.d: "To deal with more severe cases, jury trials were introduced in the district courts, consisting of twelve lay juries presided over by a professional judge. The jury determines the defendant's involvement in the crime, and the judge determines the punishment. An appeal against a jury decision is not accepted. Thanks to the advent of jury trials, the trial became more efficient and the public began to perceive it as fairer."
 rossiya.224.a: "Next case."
 rossiya.266.t: "Civil and Criminal Trial reformed"
 rossiya.266.d: "As part of the judicial reform, a serious reform of the civil and criminal trial was carried out. Instead of a court with a judge without a legal background, presided over by a secretary who considers evidence without deliberation in closed session, the court is now presided over by a panel of professional crown judges who hear evidence orally in open sessions. The process is now freer and more competitive, many obsolete provisions have been completely abolished, including criminal prosecution from now on only a court can end and dissolution of suspicion sentence."
 rossiya.266.a: "Next case."
 rossiya.225.t: "Institution of the Bar Association"
 rossiya.225.d: "The aim of the Bar Association was to guarantee that each defendant would have access to qualified legal assistance. Also, one of the tasks of the bar was to give free legal advice to the poor. The bar is an independent corporation which had its own administration in each guberniya, which dealt with various organisational matters, imposed various disciplinary penalties on its members (expulsion was common)."
 rossiya.225.a: "Did You Know That You Have Rights?"
 rossiya.249.t: "New Censorship Law"
 rossiya.249.d: "According to the temporary rules on the press, some changes were made to censorship. Thus, editions of more than 10 sheets were exempted from preliminary censorship, however, they were subject to punitive censorship - if sedition is present in the published edition, the publication receives a lawsuit. At the same time, censored areas are quite large, especially in cases of spiritual issues. These regulations have generally relaxed censorship, but it is still not worth talking about establishing a free press."
 rossiya.249.a: "Ah yes, here is my beloved Kolokol magazine, completely banned but still sent through Prussia!"
 rossiya.284.t: "Censorship Law Further Softened"
 rossiya.284.d: "As part of the reformist course, it was decided to further weaken censorship. Now she limits only statements to the royal family and the church, almost completely freeing most other topics. Another relaxation of censorship further reduced the costs and time for preparing press materials, which led to a new newspaper and magazine boom."
 rossiya.284.a: "Oh my, THAT free press?"
 rossiya.285.t: "Censorship Counter-Reform"
 rossiya.285.d: "A new censorship law was adopted to curb the overly liberated press. His main novel was the transfer to the Minister of Internal Affairs through the censorship committee of the right to destroy copies of literature and the press, which he considered censored, out of court. On the one hand, of course, this will free many overly daring authors from trial, on the other hand, the process of censorship has become less transparent for the layman, and the state has received more freedom in the matter of silencing the opposition."
 rossiya.285.a: "Just as always."
 rossiya.287.t: "Judicial Counter-Reform"
 rossiya.287.d: "Judicial Reform is one of the most deepest ones, as well as probably the most radical. The state lost too much influence on judicial decisionmacking, which is unaceptable in times of violent radicalism. We will change trial proceedings and transfer terrorist cases from jury to military tribunals. In addition, we will adjust powers of crown to reassign and move judges to different courts across our Empire in order to remind them about importance of their position and obligation to judge for good of the state. This way no political extremist will expect warm decision for them and will think twice if they want to break the law."
 rossiya.287.a: "Little setback"
 rossiya.226.t: "Establishment of the State Treasury"
 rossiya.226.d: "Under the Ministry of Finance, treasuries administering all state revenues were set up and local financial self-governing bodies called control chambers were established. The independent cash offices of various state bodies (from which money often disappeared without leaving a trace) were replaced by a single cash office of the state treasury. The position of the Auditor General increased, who was to give his opinion on the draft State Budget and submit to the Council of State a report on the execution of the previous year's budget. The state thus began to spend its finances more efficiently, while the scope for corruption was considerably reduced."
 rossiya.226.a: "Money likes an account"
 rossiya.227.t: "Town Dumas and Upravas"
 rossiya.227.d: "One of the most important changes within the framework of the urban reform was the creation of the town Duma, an all-people elected by property census, which is the legislative body of the town, and the town Uprava, which is accountable to it, dealing with economic matters. With the inclusion of the big urban bourgeoisie and the reform-minded nobility in city administration, urban life and the public infrastructure gained a significant impulse to development."
 rossiya.227.a: "Initiative has its place in Russia"
 rossiya.228.t: "Establishment of the State Bank of the Russian Empire"
 rossiya.228.d: "The first bank to be called a 'state bank' was established in Russia by Peter III, but it never functioned. Since then several so-called state banks have sprung up, none of which carried out all the necessary operations. Today the State Bank of the Russian Empire has finally been set up and can truly be called the country's main bank. Its competences include registering and buying and selling securities, buying and selling gold and silver, accepting deposits, issuing loans, and so on. The bank's tasks include, among other things, financing the treasury and supporting commercial and industrial development. Although it will take some time to integrate all state institutions into this bank and to adapt the financial system, the State Bank will undoubtedly be a great help in developing the economy and in revitalising the country's finances."
 rossiya.228.a: "Now get to work!"
 rossiya.229.t: "Promote Dmitrii Zamyatnin"
 rossiya.229.d: "Tsar Alexander II wants his proposed reforms of the Russian judicial system to succeed. As such it is recommended to appoint Dmitrii Zamyatin to the post of Justice minister. Mr Zamyatin has already proven to be an extremely efficient politician and administrator."
 rossiya.229.a: "Long live the Russian Empire!"
 rossiya.230.t: "Zemstvo"
 rossiya.230.d: "By order of the tsar a new system of local governance shall be introduced in the whole of Russia. Citizens shall be able to elect local councillors to deal with the everyday issues on the local levels. This should make the governance of Russia more effective."

 rossiya.237.t: "Petrovskaya Agricultural Academy"
 rossiya.237.d: "By imperial order of Tsar Alexander II the first higher agricultural educational institution to help challenge the lack of experts that Russia is in a dire need of to organize the scientific based agricultural production that Russia needs to secure its food production."
 rossiya.237.a: "Sounds good!"
 rossiya.241.t: "History of the Jews in Russia"
 rossiya.241.d: "Jews have lived in our country for over a millennia and they have lately been restricted to an area in western Russia. Every now and then the question arises if there should be any changes to the current arraignment. Should jews be allowed to settle in the whole of Russia or shall we curtain the area where they are currently allowed to live?"
 rossiya.241.a: "Sounds good!"
 rossiya.242.t: "Synagogue Laws"
 rossiya.242.d: "Ever since our great Tsarina Katarina decided the jews should be restricted to the western Russia we have been able to keep our control off them. That shouldn’t change, let them stay where they are, all petitions to settle in other parts of Russia and build synagogues should therefore be denied."
 rossiya.242.a: "Sounds good!"
 rossiya.243.t: "Free Movement Laws"
 rossiya.243.d: "Ever since our great Tsarina Katarina decided the jews should be restricted to the western Russia we have been able to keep our control off them. However as far as can be discerned, the jews are no threat to the motherland, on the contrary, they are an asset. Which is why we should allow them to settle wherever they want in Russia, releasing their potential to the benefit of the whole country"
 rossiya.243.a: "Sounds good!"
 rossiya.244.t: "Situation with Jewish Merchants"
 rossiya.244.d: "Jewish merchants have showed amazing skills in the bank sector. Imagine what they can do if we let the pursue whatever trade they want? We need to overcome the opponents who seem to have no other argument against this then that the merchants are Jewish."
 rossiya.244.a: "Sounds good!"
 rossiya.245.t: "Horace Osipovich Gunzburg"
 rossiya.245.d: "Baron Horace Osipovich Ginzburg belongs to the Jewish business dynasty of the Ginzburgs, who made their fortune from trade and wine taxes. He founded the bank I. E. Ginzburg with his father Eüsel in St. Petersburg and in 1872 he co-founded the Siberian Commercial Bank, the Kiev Private Commercial Bank and the Odessa Commercial Bank. In 1874 he became a co-owner of the Berezovsky and later Miass gold business. \n\nAs one of the richest men in the Empire, Horace headed many organisations dedicated to the advancement of Jews in Russia and was also a patron of the arts, sponsoring the building of the St Petersburg Choral Synagogue and paying for the education of several artists of Jewish origin."

 rossiya.248.d: "Lieutenant-General Yakov Ivanovich Rostovtsev's career included the Turkish campaign of 1828 and the suppression of the Polish uprising in 1831, after which he became involved in military schools, introducing a number of innovations to improve the quality of education. \n\nIn 1857 he was appointed a member of the unofficial Peasant Reform Committee, where he dealt with the submitted drafts. Although at first he was sceptical about the reform, after he had visited Dresden and studied the literature on the peasant question, he drastically changed his opinion and became the main supporter of the abolition of serfdom. Under his chairmanship, the Drafting Commissions set up to draft the reform set the direction for the changes outlined later in the Manifesto on the Abolition of Serfdom."
 rossiya.248.a: "Long live Alexander II the Liberator!"
 rossiya.250.t: "Moscow Town Regulation"
 rossiya.250.d: "The Gorodovoye Polozheniye of 1862 established a reform of Moscow's urban public administration. Its main provision was the creation of the General Duma, elected from the five city estates, which formed the Disposition Duma, the body of executive power. The city budget, formed mainly from direct taxes on real estate owners, financed the administrative and police apparatus, while the organs of self-administration were concerned with economic and beautification matters.  The autonomy of the local government did not become absolute, but state control was generally diminished and a broader section of the population was allowed to participate in the administration of the city."
 rossiya.250.a: "Long live Alexander II the Liberator!"
 rossiya.251.t: "Gorodovoye polozheniye in Major Cities"
 rossiya.251.d: "The experience of reforming Moscow's city government has been a success. It was decided to apply the Moscow city regulation to other major cities, such as St Petersburg, Tiflis and Odessa. It might be worth applying this reform to the rest of Russia's cities as well..."
 rossiya.251.a: "The Experiment Continues"
 rossiya.253.t: "City Financing Reform"
 rossiya.253.d: "Before the start of urban reform, city budgets were almost entirely dependent on government allocations. On the one hand this limited the freedom of action of the city government, on the other hand it put a burden on the state budget. Being authorised to finance from taxes collected in the city on property owners, the cities have got rid of both problems to a large extent, improving their own and state finances considerably and at the same time having got at their disposal the funds necessary for the development of the city."
 rossiya.253.a: "Every penny counted"
 rossiya.254.t: "First elections in Town Dumas"
 rossiya.254.d: "In Nizhny Novgorod, Penza, Simbirsk and other cities, the first elections to the City Duma were held. Despite the property qualification of 100 rubles of annual income from real estate or capital, not only bored nobles, but also active merchants and part of the intelligentsia could now be elected to the Duma, which revived the city management. Despite considerable control by the authorities, the first brick of self-government in Russia was laid."
 rossiya.254.a: "The first seeds of self-government have fallen on Russian soil"
 rossiya.255.t: "Provincial City Affairs Comissions"
 rossiya.255.d: "To deal with complaints and conflict cases, provincial town councils were set up. These were special collegiate bodies composed of the governor, the vice-governor, the administrator of the Treasury Chamber, the district court prosecutor, the chairman of the magistrates' congress, the chairman of the provincial Uprava and the mayor of the provincial town."
 rossiya.255.a: "To work, gentleman!"
 rossiya.256.t: "Fruits of Urban Reform"
 rossiya.256.d: "The recently adopted Urban Reform is already starting to pay off. \n\nFor example, in Nizhny Novgorod, an important commercial and industrial centre at the confluence of the Oka and the Volga, the newly elected Duma has already carried out several socially useful activities: a new free water pipeline has been built, the first real schools, maternity houses and hospitals, public baths have been established, gas lighting is now available. \n\nThe participation of the urban population in the management of economic activities and the opportunity to dispose of the collected taxes has a very positive effect on the development of cities and, in particular, significantly improves the state treasury."
 rossiya.256.a: "There is a place for self-government in Russia!"
 rossiya.257.t: "Modernisation of the Taxation System"
 rossiya.257.d: "The tax system in Russia is, to put it mildly, flawed. Its foundation in its present form was laid by Peter the Great, and it has since become completely obsolete. The shortfall in the per capita tax is steadily increasing, the payoffs from indirect taxes cause terrible corruption, and in general the treasury collects taxes completely inefficiently. In order to improve the situation, the following measures were taken: the repurchases were abolished and replaced by excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol, issued by a special excise office, and the per capita tax was abolished for bourgeoisie, replaced by a property tax. Although per capita tax on the rest of the population was retained, the tax system became leaner and more efficient, which would greatly improve the position of the treasury and ease corruption."
 rossiya.257.a: "Great"
 rossiya.258.t: "Improvement of the State Finances Transparency"
 rossiya.258.d: "How money is channelled and spent in Russia is a mystery. The scale of embezzlement has long been the talk of the town, and the effectiveness of government measures suffers greatly. Measures have been taken to improve transparency in finance by introducing the principle of publicity in finance and by starting to publish the state budget. Agencies were required to prepare detailed accounts and estimates that explained all expenditures of money and that were available for public scrutiny. The State Budget was subject to approval by the Council of State and the Emperor and henceforth had the force of law. With these measures the embezzlement was reduced and the money was now spent much more generously."
 rossiya.258.a: "Follow the money"
 rossiya.259.t: "Establishment of the Main Buyback Institution"
 rossiya.259.d: "The State Bank was involved in the buyback operation. It was entrusted with issuing buyback certificates and 5 per cent bank notes, and was also responsible for monitoring the receipt of buyback payments in the treasury, as well as preparing annual reports on the buyback operation."
 rossiya.259.a: "Everyone is in business."
 rossiya.260.t: "Lacking in Gold for Monetary Reform"
 rossiya.260.d: "The instability of the rouble and the constant issuance of unsecured gold notes cause a terrible mess and constant and persistent inflation, which has a negative effect on the economy. The most effective solution to this problem would be to introduce a gold standard for the rouble, i.e. to back each unit of currency with gold. Unfortunately, according to a study by the Ministry of Finance, the state, which is in the midst of reforms and industrialization, does not have enough money to buy enough gold. All that remains is to wait until the coffers are sufficiently full and the situation is calm enough to embark on this ambitious reform."
 rossiya.260.a: "Not today."
 rossiya.261.t: "Financial Reform Completed"
 rossiya.261.d: "Despite the impossibility of introducing a gold standard, the financial reform carried out by the government can be considered a success. Modernisation has fundamentally reorganised the state's financial system, making it more open and more efficient. Strict accounting of the state budget set the economy on a new path of development, corruption was reduced, the treasury was spent on important items and activities, and officials were made more responsible for the management of the money. Thanks to the new system, the state will be able to overcome the crisis and mitigate the negative consequences of the peasant reform."
 rossiya.261.a: "Three cheers for the Ministry of Finance!"
 rossiya.271.t: "Reorganisation of the Ministry of Public Education"
 rossiya.271.d: "In order to meet the demands of the times, the Ministry of Public Education has once again undergone a reorganisation. The ministry, consisting of the Council of Ministers, the Department of National Education and the Academic Committee, will now focus on the decentralisation of education and the training of new teachers."
 rossiya.271.a: "Now get to work!"
 rossiya.272.t: "Russian graduates in European universities"
 rossiya.272.d: "In order to train a new generation of Russian teachers, as well as to draw on the experience of Western European universities, Russian university graduates were sent abroad to practise. When they returned home, they brought not only invaluable knowledge about the organisation of higher education and the experience needed for teaching, but also some cutting-edge Western ideas and developments that would be of great benefit to the country."
 rossiya.272.a: ""On the French side, on a foreign land, I have a university to attend...""
 rossiya.273.t: "New University Charter"
 rossiya.273.d: "The crowning achievement of the reform of higher education is the new University Charter. The new Charter gave more independence to the universities in the matters of internal administration and expanded the possibilities of taking the local conditions for their development into account, created more favourable conditions for scientific and educational activities, made university teaching more attractive for young people and contributed to the establishment of a sufficient number of qualified teachers at university chairs in the future and provided for a number of special measures to encourage students to study sciences. The trustee of the school district only supervised the legality of the actions of the council. However, university students were not entitled to a corporate body and outsiders were not allowed to attend lectures at all."
 rossiya.273.a: "Non scholae sed vitae discimus"
 rossiya.274.t: "Regulation on Elementary Schools"
 rossiya.274.d: "To improve public education, a new Regulation on Elementary Schools was drawn up, which, unlike the laws of 1828, allowed government departments to finance elementary schools. A new system of management was introduced. Instead of the single-person authority of grammar school principals and supervisors of district schools, collegial school boards with representatives of local government will be set up. These schools will be based on universal principles and will ensure greater access to education."
 rossiya.274.a: "First time in first grade"
 rossiya.275.t: "Decentralisation of Educational Administration"
 rossiya.275.d: "In order to improve the efficiency of education and reduce the administrative burden on the state, it was decided to decentralise control over education to a certain extent. The authority of the trustees of the school districts was strengthened and the administrative dependence of the lower schools on the secondary schools was broken down."
 rossiya.275.a: "Less control, more order"
 rossiya.276.t: "New Gymnasium Charter"
 rossiya.276.d: "In accordance with the new charter the upper secondary schools were divided into classical and practical ones. The classical gymnasiums provided humanitarian education which was based on the teaching of ancient languages. In practical gymnasiums the volume of teaching mathematics and natural science was increased by reducing the hours for humanities subjects. Graduates of classical gymnasiums had the right to enter universities without having to pass examinations. The graduates of the practical gymnasiums had no access to the universities and could continue their education mainly in technical higher schools. The charter also established pro-gymnasiums, four-class schools, mostly in small towns, which facilitated access to regular gymnasiums.  Although the cost of education in gymnasiums was still high, they could now be attended by children of all estates, expanding educational opportunities for millions of people."
 rossiya.276.a: "Back to school"
 rossiya.277.t: "Regulation on Female Schools"
 rossiya.277.d: "The Regulations on Female Schools under the authority of the Ministry of National Education were created to ensure the operation of female schools. The Statute establishes three- and six-room women's schools, which are to provide a basic, largely spiritual and moral education for girls. These institutions are intended to be private and public, but in the end the state treasury will also allocate funds for the development of these schools. Although these institutions do not grant admission to universities and their curriculum lags far behind that of men's schools and gymnasiums, it is an important step in the development of female education in Russia."
 rossiya.277.a: "We will educate everyone, men and women"
 rossiya.278.t: "First Supreme Female Courses Organised"
 rossiya.278.d: "In addition to secondary education, there has been a debate in the academic and teaching community about the need to provide women with higher education as well. Although university academic councils are largely against the admission of women to higher education, the Ministry of Public Education decided to encourage the creation of Higher Women's Courses - programmes to educate women along the lines of men's classical gymnasiums and universities, which would provide additional knowledge. The first such courses were set up in St Petersburg, at Gymnasium No 5 near Alarche Bridge, and in Moscow, at Lubyanka. Although the courses attended do not constitute higher education, graduates of these courses would be able to become teachers and, in the future, if women's education developed, higher women's courses could be recognised as institutions of higher education."
 rossiya.278.a: "Women are just as eager as men to learn"
 rossiya.279.t: "Education Reform Complete!"
 rossiya.279.d: "After many months of hard work, most of the provisions of the education reform were put into practice. By reforming general and higher education and giving women the opportunity to study, Russia has begun the process of broad education of its population, which will allow it to fully enter the industrial age."
 rossiya.279.a: "Hurray for the Ministry of Public Education!"
 rossiya.280.t: "New Opportunities for Female Education"
 rossiya.280.d: "Thanks to the growing public support for female education and the more progressive attitude of ministers and officials, it was decided to continue to expand women's education possibilities. So, it was decided to equalise women's and men's schools, open opportunities for women's gymnasiums, and also give the status of higher educational institutions to the Higher Women's Courses. As a result, women will have almost equal rights to education and appropriate opportunities for professional activities as men."
 rossiya.280.a: "The Russian woman is truly Vasilisa the Wise."
 rossiya.281.t: "Fruits of Female Education"
 rossiya.281.d: "The expansion of women's education is bearing fruit. Women educated in gymnasiums and Women's Higher Courses become teachers, improving the shortage of staff in educational institutions throughout the country, work in medical institutions, helping the development of medicine, and participate in scientific, literary, cultural and other social activities. All this brings great benefits to the country."
 rossiya.281.a: "Glory to the Russian woman!"
 rossiya.282.t: "New Conservative Gymnasium Charter"
 rossiya.282.d: "Gymnasium programmes and administration under the last course were too liberal and led to a licentiousness of youth and the spread of nihilism. This situation must be corrected! In order to preserve the moral education of the youth, priority will be given to classical gymnasiums with an emphasis on teaching ancient languages and theology, which will create a correct moral education. In addition, higher education should remain the privilege of the nobility, so non-noble children should be excluded from gymnasiums by various methods. In order to meet all conditions the upper secondary schools should be placed under the strict state control."
 rossiya.282.a: "Everyone has his own place"
 rossiya.283.t: "Unexpected Rise of Nihilist Youth"
 rossiya.283.d: "Unthinkable! Despite the measures taken by the Ministry of Public Education to provide moral education, the spread of nihilism among young people has only increased! Having received a basic education, but faced with the rejection of classical gymnasiums, young people become even more fascinated by anarchist ideas and become involved in revolutionary activities!"
 rossiya.283.a: "What have we done wrong?"
 rossiya.262.t: "Public supports the Reforms"
 rossiya.262.d: "The public is feeling an exalted impulse as they await the coming reforms. In clubs and flats, in restaurants and pubs, on estates and in peasant huts, one can feel the wind of change that should dispel the stale air of the Nikolai I times. Great hopes are placed on the new Tsar."
 rossiya.262.a: "The wind of change."
 rossiya.263.t: "Non-supportive aristocracy"
 rossiya.263.d: "However, not everyone is happy with the forthcoming changes. The old aristocracy, the heroes of the military campaigns of the past, the guardians of the nobility's tradition dating back to Alexander I, are largely opposed to the reforms, which threaten to strip them of their position in society and, in their view, destroy the stability of the Empire. While the demand for change, prompted by defeat in the Eastern War, outweighs the grumbling of the aristocrats, they will certainly not surrender their Old Order without a fight."
 rossiya.263.a: ""...For the antiquity of years their enmity to freedom is impertinent.""
 rossiya.642.t: "Worsening Conservative Unrest"
 rossiya.642.d: "Gendarmes are bringing more and more grim reports every day. It seems, that many even not that conservative members of upper class start worrying about "radicalism", which has entrenched in the cabinet. There are many strange rumors, but it is clear that aristocracy is growing hostile to our government. Because of their influence in administrative appartus the manageability of our administration is getting worse, which in long term could lead to complete collapse. We must release the steam for a bit and contain the most radical voices in our government, or else we may face some horrible consequences - even our dear Tsar is in danger."
 rossiya.642.a: "We need to do something"
 rossiya.643.t: "Worsening Reformist Unrest"
 rossiya.643.d: "Gendarmes are bringing more and more grim reports every day. It seems, that many even not that progressive members of our society start worrying about "reaction" which takes place in our country. There are many strange rumors, but it is clear that intelegencia and other progressive elements of our society are growing hostile to our government. Because of their numbers and influence in media the overall opinion about our government is getting worse, which in long term could lead to revolts. We must release the steam for a bit and contain the most reactionary voices in our government, or else we may face some horrible consequences - even our dear Tsar is in danger."
 rossiya.643.a: "We need to do something"
 rossiya.644.t: "Reformist Society Confidence"
 rossiya.644.d: "Gendarmerie public opinion reports show steady increase in confidence in government between our politicaly invested subjects. Publicists in their magazines, professors in their university rooms, writers in their poems and books, even students, with exception of most radical ones, in their cramped rented rooms and pubs, discuss our policies with notable approval. It seems, that civic society is satisfied with our course, which makes our day-to-day work more than comfortable."
 rossiya.644.a: "Most interesting"
 rossiya.645.t: "Conservative Society Confidense"
 rossiya.645.d: "Gendarmerie public opinion reports show steady increase in confidence in government between our most prominent subjects - aristocrates and bueroucrats. At private meetings and salons "destructive liberalism" and "terribly wrong course of the government" are not the discussible themes anymore. Moreover, most of the high society members now hold great respect of our Tsar, who defends the tradition and values from bloodthirsty democrates. The liberals, on the other hand, are disillusioned with our course and will most certainly make some moves to make our life worse. But it does not matter, as the old guard is on our side."
 rossiya.645.a: "At least for now..."

The Cause of Yankies is more than just, not to mention that Dixies seem to be supported by British and French.

Anyway, peasant rebellion will be crushed and rule of old aristocracy will be restored, but St.Petersburg's presence is expected to be way bigger, considering loss of legitimicy and power of old nobility."

Exiled to the Caucasus, participants in the Polish uprising in 1830-1831, ordinary Polish recruits and officers have long been leaving for the Circassians. There they train the Circassian units and help conduct reconnaissance, and also simply settle among the villages.

They returned home in 1863, immediately establishing contacts with political prisoners and Polish people who were exiled after their recent rebellion. They were gathering forces and money to incite revolt in Siberia, but their plot was uncovered recently. Forty-four members of the group were arrested and taken to prison by Russian law enforcement after watch officers of the Siberian Cadet Corps searched cadet Arseny Samsonov, aged 16, for illicit items and found a proclamation entitled 'To Patriots of Siberia', attributed to the collective authorship of G. Potanin, N. Yadrintsev, and other leaders of the movement. Now, all of them have been sent to various places around the country for either penal labor or exile, ensuring that we won't hear of them revolting again. Their ideas got some foothold within minds of local the bourgeoisie in Tomsk, Tobolsk, and Irkutsk, but that doesn't matter, because no one questions our authority in those lands anymore."

 rossiya.431.d: "Russian envoy brought us some interesting proposal, concerning trade between Russia and our nation. They offer bilateral cut of tariffs on goods, tax cooperation and set of other minor adjustments with goal to expand our bilateral trade. Russian Empire has lots of natural resources we are in need to, as well as their market could be lucrative for our entrepreneurs. Form other side, do we want to closer our ties to the Empire?"
 rossiya.431.a: "More trade is always good, accept their proposal."
 rossiya.431.b: "We do not need more of russian influence, reject the proposal."
 rossiya.432.t: "Trade Agreent Proposal Accepted"
 rossiya.432.d: "Foreign ministery has some good news: our ambasador informs us that the trade agreement we offered to our foreign collegues, was accepted. There is lot of paper work to do from now on, but our enterpreneurs and treasury will be ready to reap the benefits of increasing trade in years to come."
 rossiya.432.a: "Toast to the free trade!."
 rossiya.433.t: "Trade Agreent Proposal Accepted"
 rossiya.433.d: "Foreign ministery has some sad news: our ambasador informs us that the trade agreement we offered to our foreign collegues, was rejected. Despite all the benefits, offered by our proposal, they feared our increased influence. Sadly, the trade between our nations will remain under huge tarrifs."
 rossiya.433.a: "So much for free trade."
 rossiya.437.t: "Russian Warships!"
 rossiya.437.d: "Russia has sent one of their best military leaders to personally lead a seven warships. We have no capabilities to counter this fleet, we should see what the Russians want from us."
 rossiya.437.a: "Not Good" 
 rossiya.438.t: "The case of the detention of the curtain-raiser in Kushunai"
 rossiya.438.d: "Russia has slowly been building up their mililtary presence on Sakhalin. If left unchecked, they will likely try and take the entire island. Koide has appealed to the Shogun to open negotioations with the Russians in a hope to resolve any border dispute."
 rossiya.438.a: "Form delegation" 
 rossiya.438.b: "Border remains unchanged"
 rossiya.439.t: "Incidents by Russia"
 rossiya.439.d: "Russian troops have been causing issues to our people in the Sakhalin region."
 rossiya.439.a: "Not Good" 
 rossiya.440.t: "Koide's direct appeal"
 rossiya.440.d: "Russia has slowly been building up their mililtary presence on Sakhalin and causing problems to our people. If left unchecked, they will likely try and take the entire island. Koide has directly appealed to the Shogun to open negotioations with the Russians in a hope to resolve any border dispute."
 rossiya.440.a: "Form delegation" 
 rossiya.440.b: "Border remains unchanged"
 rossiya.441.t: "Determine the content of the request"
 rossiya.441.d: "We must determine what our request to Russia must say over Sakhalin."
 rossiya.441.a: "Passable for both armies" 
 rossiya.441.b: "Only Russia is closed to traffic" 
 rossiya.441.c: "Demilitarisation"
 rossiya.442.t: "Japanese institutions receive an audience with the emperor"
 rossiya.442.d: "Japanese institutions receive an audience with the emperor. They are here to discuss the dispute over the boder of Sakhalin."
 rossiya.442.a: "We will come to an agreement" 
 rossiya.443.t: "Signing of the Sakhalin Island Provisional Regulations"
 rossiya.443.d: "Sakhalin is an isolated territory, bordering both Russian nad Japanese states. Adventurers and administrators from both countries enter the island and try to establish hold on it. To reduce possibility of conflict between those, provisional regulations will be signed, establishing condominium status, so both countries will share the island together until later treaties."
 rossiya.443.a: "Great!" 
 rossiya.444.t: "Treaty of Saint Petersburg"
 rossiya.444.d: "After years of negotiations, russian and japanese diplomats arived in St.Petersburg to sign new treaty, which will establish new borders between countries. According to the agreement, island of Sakhalin will be ceded to Russian Empire in its entirety, reworking previous condominium status, while Japan will recieve all of Kuril islands, including former russian ones. This way, relations between countries will be improved and status-quo on the East will be reached. Do we agree?"
 rossiya.444.a: "Accept" 
 rossiya.444.b: "Refuse"
 rossiya.445.t: "Japan Accepts"
 rossiya.445.d: "Japanese diplomats signed the treaty! Being one of the first "equal" treaties with european country, it is a great succsess for japanese, so there were little doubt."
 rossiya.445.a: "Great!"
 rossiya.446.t: "Japan Refuses"
 rossiya.446.d: "Japanese diplomats refused the treaty! ALthought it could be one of the first "equal" treaties with european country, japanese found it too inadequate, so negotiations stalled."
 rossiya.446.a: "Unfortunate"


 ###ECONOMY AND TRADE EVENTS
 rossiya.501.t: "Krenholm Manufacturing Company"
 rossiya.501.d: "Your Majesty, cotton merchant Ludwig Knoop of the Free State of Bremen, has established the Krenholm Manufacturing Company, a cotton spinning and weaving mill in Estonia on the banks of the Narva River. This factory is massive and maybe the largest in the world. Employing 12,000 people, and owning 32,000 acres of land, Knoop will surely be a very powerful man, important to our economy, and it is in our best interest that we keep him on our good side."
 rossiya.501.a: "Excellent"
 rossiya.502.t: "Protests Against Vodka!"
 rossiya.502.d: "Prices for alcohol have always been relatively low in Russia since the times of Ivan IV, but over the recent years that prices increased gradually. In the 1830's to 1840's prices had risen to 2-3 rubles per bucket of vodka. This money is also a price for a calf.\nNow it became even worse, as prices for vodka have risen three times as large as they were in the 1850 year. This is because Russia needs to replenish its depleted budget after the Crimean War, but also it causes instability in our states, especially among the poor. Protests against that policy originally started in Kovno Governorate, in Lithuania, where local villagers took oaths to abstain from drinking any high-degree alcohol except for "medicinal purposes". However, wine and beer are still permitted. Locals, supported by the Catholic clergy, established chapters of the Brotherhood of Sobriety, a temperance society that originated in Silesia and has support from the Pope himself. That was at the end of the 1858 year\nFew months ago the situation has become even worse - peasants all around the Empire are taking oaths of abstention from vodka. Boycotts were in 91 uyezds (an area that is part of the governorate) of 32 governorates. Sales of alcohol dramatically decreased, with vodka prices dropped in 16-20 times and retailers sometimes offering vodka for free. Now members of temperance societies attack taverns and destroy alcohol stockpiles. This is going beyond the borders of good and bad..."
 rossiya.502.a: "Send troops! Secure that no tavern will be under attack from this very day!"
 rossiya.503.t: "Konstantin Rudski & Co. Ltd."
 rossiya.503.d: "My Emperor, today Konstantin Ruski & Co. Ltd was founded. The company owns an iron foundry in the city of Warsaw, whilst also specializing in machinery, steel, and engineering. Owned by successful Polish shipbuilding magnate Andrzej Artur Zamoyski, only proper things are expected of the company."
 rossiya.503.a: "Keep at it."
 rossiya.504.t: "The St.Petersburg-Warsaw Railroad Opens"
 rossiya.504.d: "The St.Petersburg-Warsaw railway, after many months of construction, has been opened to the public. This is quite important, as it connects two vital cities in our great nation. Warsaw is the heart of our Polish territories, and St. Petersburg our capital. This will help better facilitate the transport of our troops across the country, and greatly improve our economy. The construction of greater infrastructure and railroads is something that we need to accomplish to lead our way towards industralization and to nurture the wounds from the Crimean War."
 rossiya.504.a: "Great!"
 rossiya.505.t: "The Establishment of the Federal Customs Service"
 rossiya.505.d: "We have just established the federal customs service to help better control and regulate migration to and fro. This is especially necessary as a great refugee migration crossing over from the Ottoman Empire strikes us day by day. Our customs officers, are at this moment setting up control points all over our borders, and creating a more protected state. That is all for now your highness."
 rossiya.505.a: "Finally!"
 rossiya.506.t: "New Machine Plant"
 rossiya.506.d: "Your highness, the artillery plant you ordered the construction of has just been completed in St.Petersburg. Housing state of the art machinery, and highly trained workers and engineers, this factory promises to be an example of our great imperial industrial might."
 rossiya.506.a: "Let's begin production"
 rossiya.507.t: "Tax Debate Between Government and Zemstvas"
 rossiya.507.d: "Since 1725, when Peter the Great installed the Soul Tax, there have been many incidents happening in the motherland: crises, wars, and industrial advancements has changed the world and Russia as well. Now the Soul Tax became mostly obsolete even in a modernized state. Hence why the government is adamantly pushing to discuss it with the respective Zemstvos of the Russian Governorates. Half support graduating from lower to higher income tax which will be levied upon all the population and will leave the tax income on state budget the same, the outcome being peasants and commoners living better in cost of nobility cash. Some other commissions supported the usual income tax, but only for merchants, and some additional taxes on the nobility and peasants. The idea barley made it through, as it was laughed at due to its ineffectiveness, with the central government shutting it down almost immediately. Finally, one more proposal: property taxes instead of both soul and income taxes. If you have much property but a low income you should sell a portion of your items to have overall lower taxes. All things will be levied with those new taxes, from spoons to great estates spanning kilometers. This is an unpopular and very untraditional proposal but it gained support through the economically competent people in our realm. Maybe we should listen to them. Or we can just drop all the initiative and suffer the consequences of an inefficient tax policy. The Nobility would be pleased with that."
 rossiya.507.a: "Let's not rush to do this..."
 rossiya.507.b: "Progressive tax is very progressive, isn't it?"
 rossiya.507.c: "The Tambov commission has very interesting ideas about property taxes."
 rossiya.508.t: "Imperial Russian Technical Society"
 rossiya.508.d: "To further the development of Russia’s manufacturing and production industries, the ministries of Education and Finance has taken the initiative to found the Imperial Russian Technical Society that will bring together scientist, engineers and others to promote technological development in Russia."
 rossiya.508.a: "Amazing news!"
 rossiya.509.t: "Establishment of St. Petersburg Mutual Loan Society"
 rossiya.509.d: "After the establishment of the State Bank and the streamlining of finance in Russia, the first credit institutions began to appear. The first private banks were mutual loan societies - organisations in which depositors were members who lent to each other for commercial activities, jointly managing these societies. Such is the St. Petersburg Mutual Loan Society, founded by Evgeny Ivanovich Lamansky, comrade chairman of the State Bank. With the development of industry and commerce, this format of organisation is in demand, with merchants in major trading cities such as Moscow founding local mutual loan societies to finance their activities."
 rossiya.509.a: "The common good is everyone's good"
 rossiya.510.t: "Agriculture Society in Congress Poland"
 rossiya.510.d: "Recently many ideas are appearing to improve economic situation in Poland. One of them is to encourage establishment of Agriculture Society, entity where polish intellectuals could debate about land reform to come up with most perfect variant. This may release some anger from intellegencia, seeking for liberty of discussions. In the same time such organisation could become forum for revolutionaries. What is our stance?"
 rossiya.510.a: "Full support for this idea!"
 rossiya.510.b: "Partial support for this idea!"
 rossiya.510.c: "Waste of sources!"
 rossiya.511.t: "The Warsaw Main School"
 rossiya.511.d: "Education in the Tsardom of Poland was currently extremely poor. To remedy this situation, Alexander Wielopolski, a major Polish nobleman and sympathiser of the reformist Prince Konstantin Nikolaevich, was commissioned to organise the Main School in Warsaw, a higher education institution with four faculties: law, medicine, physics and mathematics, and history and philology. This will greatly improve the situation of education in the region, but some of our counsellors insist that Poles have no use for education and will only turn it against the crown. Should we heed this advice or should we support the Main School even more?"
 rossiya.511.a: "We do not change our mind, let the Main Shool be as it is."
 rossiya.511.b: "Actually, we must increase Main Shool support!"
 rossiya.511.c: "Councelors are right, poles do not need more education."
 rossiya.600.t: "[RUS.GetNameDef] Is Debt-Free"
 rossiya.600.d: "We have finally paid off our debt."
 rossiya.600.a: "Our frugality has paid off!"
 rossiya.601.t: "A Debt Repayment Has Been Made"
 rossiya.601.d: "We have paid off part of our debt. Now we must decide if we will continue to pay our debts or pay it off at a later time."
 rossiya.601.a: "Good news."
 
 rossiya.620.t: "Picking Ministers"
 rossiya.620.d: "The drafts sent in by experts and provincial committees require the inclusion of state officials in the Editorial Boards, so that they can draw up a rough project of the reforms on the basis of these drafts. Among officials there are many skeptics, such as Count Viktor Panin, zealous defender of the Ancien Régime, and supporters of radical reforms, headed by Privy Councillor Nikolai Milyutin. Which of them should be listened to?"
 rossiya.620.a: "We don't need turmoil, let's opt for conservatives."
 rossiya.620.b: "The conservatives are blind, let's promote the reformists"
 rossiya.621.t: "Picking Landowner Deputies"
 rossiya.621.d: "When thinking about emancipating the peasants, like it or not, the opinion of the nobility will have to be listened to. Most of them will be outraged at the very idea of abolishing serfdom. However, among the nobility, especially among circles of liberal Westerners and Slavophiles, there are enough zealous opponents of serfdom in any form. Should we give more attention to the intellectual minority or should we respect the proportions by giving the rostrum to the conservatives?"
 rossiya.621.a: "We can't turn the nobility against us, choose the conservatives."
 rossiya.621.b: "The times of Ochakov and the conquest of the Crimea are over, clear way for new thought!"
 rossiya.622.t: "Reactionary project"
 rossiya.622.d: "The Conservative ministers, relying on the opinion of the nobility's majority, passed by the Conservative noblemen's deputies, drew up a corresponding draft of the Peasantry Reform. Serfdom would in fact only be relaxed, the land question was discussed in no uncertain terms, and the peasants would remain in the power of the nobility for a long time to come. General Rostovtsev, chairman of the Editorial Boards, passed away, unable to endure the heated debates with the landlords. Although the nobility is content, the Tsar and his circle realise that this project is going nowhere."
 rossiya.622.a: "The peasants will not understand it."
 rossiya.623.t: "Editorial Boards Swamp"
 rossiya.623.d: "The work of the Editorial Boards, in which both conservatives and reformists participate, resembles a swamp. Supporters and opponents of abolition of serfdom are pulling the blanket over each other, landlords are haggling with the ministers over every little detail that will be mentioned in the reform. General Rostovtsev, chairman of the Editorial Boards, passed away, unable to endure the heated debates with the landlords. However, sooner or later the reform draft will be compiled, although it will probably not satisfy anyone completely."
 rossiya.623.a: "One day they will agree"
 rossiya.624.t: "A radical project"
 rossiya.624.d: "The efforts of the liberal ministers and reform-minded representatives of the nobility from the Slavophile and Western circles have resulted in an absolutely radical project. It proposed not only an immediate emancipation of the peasants from serfdom, but also granting them the land they use, for which the landlords would be compensated by the state. Not only will this reform infuriate the landlords, but the treasury, which is not very well off, will suffer a monstrous blow as a result."
 rossiya.624.a: "It smacks of Jacobinism…"
 rossiya.625.t: "Peasant revolts"
 rossiya.625.d: "The gendarmes of Section III report on the worsening situation with regard to peasant revolts. Whereas before the peasants, excited by the forthcoming abolition of serfdom, had only been furiously lashing out at the greedy landlords, when they heard rumours about the extremely conservative nature of the reform, they lost patience and began to revolt! The number of peasant uprisings across the country is in the hundreds, if not thousands. If the Tsar does not want to wait for a full-scale peasant war, the current draft must be changed urgently."
 rossiya.625.a: "Urgently inform the Editorial Boards of the Tsar's demands!"
 rossiya.626.t: "A moderate draft"
 rossiya.626.d: "Under pressure from the Tsar and peasant uprisings, the Editorial Boards made a more moderate draft. According to it, peasants would no longer be serfs, would receive some rights of self-government and most of the civil rights not related to property. However, the land will still be in the hands of the landlord; the share the farmer will be able to exploit will be at the disposal of the village community, and the landlord will establish a fee for its use. Under certain conditions a farmer will be able to negotiate the purchase of the plot."
 rossiya.626.a: "Better than nothing"
 rossiya.627.t: "The fury of the landlords"
 rossiya.627.d: "The gendarmes of Section III report on the worsening situation with the planned Peasant Reform. The nobility, already not very enthusiastic about the abolition of serfdom, are furious over the extremely radical contents of the reform project. A ghastly uproar erupted in the estates and salons: the reform developers were accused of infringement on the property rights of the nobility, a desire to bring down the very nobility and at the same time the state, and even accusations of spying on France and Great Britain (sic!). If this goes on, the Tsar might face a real palace coup or even repeat the fate of his ill-fated ancestor Emperor Paul I. The Editorial Boards need to make some sense out of this as a matter of urgency!"
 rossiya.627.a: "Urgently inform the Editorial Boards of the Tsar's demands!"
 rossiya.628.t: "A less radical draft"
 rossiya.628.d: "Taking into account the dissatisfaction of the blue-blooded owners, the Editorial Boards made a number of changes to the draft reform. Thus, the land that a peasant uses is not given to him as property, but only as a lease with a compulsory buyout after a certain number of years. On the other hand, the farmer has the right to renounce the lease and become a free labourer, retaining his house and equipment, or to go off on all four sides. Although some of the regulations must be made more precise by local authorities, the present proposal will satisfy the farmers and will not annoy the landlords so much."
 rossiya.628.a: "Moderation is a virtue"
 rossiya.629.t: "Emancipation Manifesto"
 rossiya.629.d: "And so it happened! Tsar Alexander II had issued a Manifesto on the Abolition of Serfdom and the Statute on the Peasants Breaking Free from Serfdom, which consisted of 17 legislative acts concerning the emancipation of peasants, the conditions under which they could buy off landed estates and the amount of land to be bought off each peasant in different regions of Russia."
 rossiya.629.a: "Long live the Tsar-Liberator!"
 rossiya.630.t: "Land Distribution"
 rossiya.630.d: "The Peasant Reform established minimum and maximum shares of land for which peasants had to pay a levy based on the amount of land allocated, with at least a third of the total land remaining with the landlord. This leaves the landlord with the right to determine how much and where to allocate it, leaving plenty of room for abuse."
 rossiya.630.a: "Small redistributions"
 rossiya.631.t: "Land Distribution"
 rossiya.631.d: "The Peasant Reform established the distribution of land leased to peasants with a subsequent redemption. The landlord was entitled to retain up to a quarter of the land; the rest was redistributed among the peasants without regard to those who gave up their land. Disputes over the distribution of land had to be settled by the landlord. Even if their actions were limited, landlords could still take advantage of important agricultural properties, such as forests, meadows, mills and so on."
 rossiya.631.a: "A small rearrangement"
 rossiya.632.t: "Transitional's Labour System"
 rossiya.632.d: "The Peasant's Reform established the peasants' temporary bonded position, which would end with the conclusion of a redemption operation. Until that time, the peasants would serve the landlords in the form of duty - either as dowry or barter. There are no fixed regulations as to how much and how much they are to be paid, leaving the landlords ample room for abuse."
 rossiya.632.a: "Is this really freedom?"
 rossiya.633.t: "Transitional's Labour System"
 rossiya.633.d: "The Peasant's Reform established the peasants' temporary bonded position, which would end with the conclusion of a buyback operation. Until that time, the peasants would pay their landlords the full market price for their land. A lot of bureaucratic work has to be done to ensure that land prices will be fair. This greatly limits the scope for landowners to abuse the land, but requires additional administrative work for government officials."
 rossiya.633.a: "Some order at last!"
 rossiya.634.t: "Local Regulations"
 rossiya.634.d: "Additional regulations were issued to cover certain categories of peasants in special circumstances, such as peasants attached to private factories in the Urals, peasants in the lands of the Great Army of the Don and Stavropol Territory, Siberia and others."
 rossiya.634.a: "A point-by-point approach"
 rossiya.635.t: "Local Regulations"
 rossiya.635.d: "Additional regulations were issued to cover certain categories of peasants in special circumstances, such as peasants attached to private factories in the Urals, peasants in the lands of the Great  Cossack Army of the Don and Stavropol Territory, Siberia and others. In addition, minor amendments were made to preserve the lives and health of the peasants in the factories to which they were attached."
 rossiya.635.a: "A point-by-point approach"
 rossiya.636.t: "Buyback operation"
 rossiya.636.d: "The Peasant's Reform established a temporary tenancy for peasants freed from serfdom. The end of the temporary tenancy will be the result of a redemption transaction, in which the peasant will have to buy back the land he has been assigned. Peasants do not have the right to give up their land; at the same time, no exact date for the commencement of the redemption operation has been set, leaving this to the discretion of the landlord. The redemption price is calculated from the land lien, which together with the landlords' reassessment of the payments makes the payment considerably more expensive than the value of the land. In essence, due to the impossibility of giving up the land, the peasants are forced to pay for their personal freedom, which rather resembles the law issued by Alexander I."
 rossiya.636.a: "What is the price of human life these days?"
 rossiya.637.t: "Buyback operation"
 rossiya.637.d: "The peasant reform set up a temporary bond for peasants who decided to continue cultivating their land. At the same time, a buyback operation would be carried out, in which the peasant would pay the market value of the land with interest to the landlord for 20 years. Although this would place a heavy burden on the peasants, in the end they would become owners of their land. At the same time the landlords are not happy about this, because they have to accept the deal regardless of the conditions."
 rossiya.637.a: "This is the price of compromise"
 rossiya.638.t: "End of Peasant Reform"
 rossiya.638.d: "After a long period of work, dozens of laws and a lot of fieldwork, the main part of the Peasant Reform was completed. The most important result was the abolition of serfdom as a relic of the past and a brake on the development of the country. Although in the end neither the peasants nor the landlords were completely satisfied with the reform, it was an important stage in the country's history. Only time will tell whether we did the right thing."
 rossiya.638.a: "Long live the Tsar-Liberator!"
 rossiya.639.t: "Stolen Liberty"
 rossiya.639.d: "This is not the manifesto the Tsar gave us. These were the first thoughts of many peasants on the publication of the manifesto on the emancipation of serfs. For a long time, the peasants tried to get the landlords to issue what they thought was a real decree from the Tsar that would grant real liberty. But all in vain. As the years passed, the peasants, burdened by tribute or buyback, became more and more disillusioned. And more and more agitator Narodniks began to swarm around them, inciting them to revolt. For the time being the peasants do not accept these urban idealists."
 rossiya.639.a: "But only for the time being."
 rossiya.640.t: "Peasant at Work"
 rossiya.640.d: "Peasant life is not plain. From dawn to dusk, the peasant toils in the sweat of his brow, sowing, reaping, caring for livestock, making crafts and selling the fruits of his labour at the markets. He has to endure hardships, squabbles with landlords, laziness of officials, envy of neighbours. But he will endure it all. Because his future lies crystal clear in front of him. His own land, without the landlord, without the officials, without the jokers in the village commune. And if not him, then his children will take care of the land, and it will feed them in return."
 rossiya.640.a: "The owner of the land is the one who works on it"
 rossiya.641.t: "New Peasant Emergence"
 rossiya.641.d: "Today, in a country consumed by all sorts of epochal incidents, another important event is passing unnoticed - the end of buyback operations. For twenty years now, peasants who have chosen to remain on their land have been paying ransoms to their landlords, and today the day has finally come when the last pennies of the debt have been paid. From now on, millions of peasants throughout the country are owners of their own land, which they work hard to cultivate and from which they live. The transfer of cultivated land into the hands of the peasants has already borne fruit - agricultural productivity is increasing every year and mechanisation is beginning to take hold in the countryside. \n\nMost importantly, the country is witnessing the emergence of a prosperous class of peasant owners, grateful to the Tsar for giving them land and ready to kick the socialists, who encourage the peasants to revolt. The loyalty of this stratum to the regime seriously knocks the ground out from under the feet of the revolutionaries, which weakens the revolutionary situation and greatly reduces the threat of revolution in the future."
 rossiya.641.a: "Hail to the Russian peasant!"
 

 #Dictatorship of the Heart
 rossiya.691.t: "Supreme Executive Commission"
 rossiya.691.d: "In view of another assassination attempt on the Tsar, it becomes clear that the situation with revolutionary violence in the country is getting out of control. To correct this situation, the Supreme Executive Commission was created, headed by Count Mikhail Loris-Melikov, which unites key state departments to ensure order and has the broadest powers. Loris-Melikov outlined his measures to ensure order: on the one hand, he proposes to severely punish the revolutionaries, on the other hand, he proposes to alleviate the plight of those already imprisoned and turn to the support of civil society."
 rossiya.691.a: "We will closely follow his career"
 rossiya.692.t: "Senate Revisions"
 rossiya.692.d: "Soon after the appointment of Loris-Melikov, Senate audits were sent to various parts of the European part of the empire. The result of their activities was a sharp decrease in the number of political cases in the field. The audit materials allowed Loris-Melikov to conclude that the main reason for public discontent was the incompleteness of the great reforms. This also applied to peasant land shortages, and redemption payments that were ruinous for their farms, and the exclusion of representatives of society from solving state issues."
 rossiya.692.a: "We must act"
 rossiya.693.t: "End of Supreme Executive Commission"
 rossiya.693.d: "Situation got a bit better thanks to the actions of Loris-Melikov and his Supreme Executive Commission. Now, according to his plan, we will move the government from emergency actions into some state of normalcy. Loris-Melikov is granted the chair of Minister of the Interior with extended powers. Count is well known for his evolutionary reformist views, the Press has already given a name for his governmental course - Dictatorship of the Heart. Only time will tell, if he will succeed to put his views into life."
 rossiya.693.a: "I love the autocracy, I love the Empire"
 rossiya.694.t: "Council of Ministers Meeting"
 rossiya.694.d: "After assassination of the Alexander II a few days ago, Alexander III held another Council of Ministers, at which the project of the Minister of the Interior Count Loris-Melikov was submitted for discussion on the creation of an advisory commission, in which representatives of the community would be involved to involve the latter in legislative process on a consultative basis. Despite the resistance of some participants, especially the chief prosecutor of the Holy Synod, Pobedonostsev, the majority of ministers spoke in favour. \n\nDespite that, Tsar, who is an autocrat, decided to follow Pobedonostsev advice and to discard the proposal. Later, on a note in which Count Loris-Melikov proposed his reform project, the Tsar wrote: "Thank God, this criminal and hasty step towards the Constitution was not taken, and this whole fantastic project was rejected in the Council of Ministers by a very small minority."\n\nCount was soon fired from his position as were many other reformist officials in the government. New Tsar has a new vision. He thinks, as many other officials, that Great Reforms have gone too far and Counter-Reforms are needed to return Russia to normalcy."
 rossiya.694.a: "Fathers and Sons."
 rossiya.695.t: "Council of Ministers Meeting"
 rossiya.695.d: "Despite another assassination attempt on the Tsar a few days ago, Alexander II nevertheless held another Council of Ministers, at which the project of the Minister of the Interior Count Loris-Melikov was submitted for discussion on the creation of an advisory commission, in which representatives of the community would be involved to involve the latter in legislative process on a consultative basis. Despite the resistance of some participants, especially the chief prosecutor of the Holy Synod, Pobedonostsev, the majority of ministers spoke in favour. \n\nAfter the meeting was over, the tsar asked Loris-Melikov to stay behind to let him in on his plan. The sovereign plans, after things settle down a bit, to transfer the throne to Tsarevich Alexander and devote himself to his new wife, Princess Yuryevskaya. Loris-Melikov, whom Alexander completely trusted, was ordered by the tsar to closely monitor the progress of further changes and bequeathed to protect the autocracy, after which he thanked the minister for his work and left.\n\nAlthough the adopted changes are not titanic, they are fully consistent with the views of Loris-Melikov on the gradual evolution of the state. There was a lot of work ahead, but the count was sure that God promised Russia a bright future."
 rossiya.695.a: "So the Tsar once again becomes Liberator."
 rossiya.696.t: "Council of Ministers Meeting"
 rossiya.696.d: "After assassination of the Alexander II a few days ago, Alexander III held another Council of Ministers, at which the project of the Minister of the Interior Count Loris-Melikov was submitted for discussion on the creation of an advisory commission, in which representatives of the community would be involved to involve the latter in legislative process on a consultative basis. Despite the resistance of some participants, especially the chief prosecutor of the Holy Synod, Pobedonostsev, the majority of ministers spoke in favour. \n\nAfter the meeting was over, the Tsar asked Loris-Melikov to stay behind. The Tsar, although he did not quite agree with the project, however, saw that numerous worthy men gathered in the government by his father, like many other officials throughout the empire, sincerely consider the path created by Alexander the Second as true and useful for the Empire. He believed that assassination of his father was committed out of a desire to prevent this course from being fulfilled, which would lead Russia to true majesty. He trusts the count to implement new reforms. Loris-Melikov was ordered by the tsar to closely monitor the progress of further changes and bequeathed to protect the autocracy, after which he thanked the minister for his work and left.\n\nAlthough the adopted changes are not titanic, they are fully consistent with the views of Loris-Melikov on the gradual evolution of the state. There was a lot of work ahead, but the count was sure that God promised Russia a bright future."
 rossiya.696.a: "So the Son followed the steps of the Father."
 rossiya.697.t: "Council of Ministers Meeting"
 rossiya.697.d: "Despite another assassination attempt on the Tsar a few days ago, Alexander II nevertheless held another Council of Ministers, at which the project of the Minister of the Interior Count Loris-Melikov was submitted for discussion on the creation of an advisory commission, in which representatives of the community would be involved to involve the latter in legislative process on a consultative basis. Despite the resistance of some participants, especially the chief prosecutor of the Holy Synod, Pobedonostsev, the majority of ministers spoke in favour. \n\nAfter the meeting was over, the tsar asked Loris-Melikov to stay behind to let him in on his plan. The sovereign plans, after things settle down a bit, to transfer the throne to Tsarevich Alexander and devote himself to his new wife, Princess Yuryevskaya. Loris-Melikov, whom Alexander completely trusted, was ordered by the tsar to protect the autocracy, and do not ever make a move to constitution of some sort, after which he thanked the minister for his work and left.\n\nThe adopted reforms are not titanic on paper and will be even less substational in the field as the establishment was completely against any changes, whilst Tsarevich has strongly conservative views and is under influence of reactionary Pobedonostsev. Count Loris-Melikov, hero of the latest war against the Ottomans and winner of many battles, lost his most important one."

 rossiya.802.a: "Amazing!"
 rossiya.803.t: "Invest in Special Training for Military Railway Department?"
 rossiya.803.d: "The soldiers of our recently created military railway department require special instructions for their tasks and the technical equipment they are dealing with in order to act efficiently in times of conflict. Investing into their training could certainly increase their usefulness and the reward they bring to the table. Given time, we might also benefit from the experiences we gain in the process. Should we make the necessary investments to facilitate their training?"
 rossiya.803.a: "Let's do it."
 rossiya.803.b: "It's not worth it."

We will continue to look into this issue."
 rossiya.806.a: "Amazing idea."

Despite being important part of russian establishment and connection with local elites, many consider such regiments as archaic and useless in modern war.

We have established the Siberian Military District, the last of the ten planned Military Districts. Now while this one is far from our great city of Moscow and away from the heartland of Russia it is just as important as any other and will be treated as such. We have elected a superb commander to lead the district and he will be revitalizing everything from our military defences to improving the new port of Vladivostok. -Dmitry Milyutin"

We have already seen this kind of bullets being used in the US civil war and how negatively the public reacted to when they saw the horrendous wounds soldiers suffered. If we don’t want to suffer the same public backlash against us, not to mention the risk of future enemies using it against our soldiers, we need to get rid of this horrible contraption! Luckily one of our statesmen has come up with an excellent conclusion. All major powers have been invited to a conference in Saint Petersburg and has presented a declaration which forbids the use of this kind of bullets. By the stroke of a pen, we have taking away the opportunity for our enemies to develop the same kind of bullets and thus removing any objections our military might have had in not being allowed to use it."

 rossiya.904.t: "Situation of Russian Navy"
 rossiya.904.d: "Your Majesty, the reports you requested on the failures of our navy during the Crimean war. In summary, the Black Sea Fleet lacked many of the modern steam-driven ships that the Allied powers had. The fleet consisted mostly of old sail-driven ships, not those driven by steam. Our failings also lie in the strategic decisions of the Admirals, your Majesty. They refused to attack the transport and supply ships, allowing the Allied forces to land in Crimea. Since the navy refused to attack, their land forces were well-supplied and constantly reinforcing. Our fleet stayed in the harbour of Sevastopol thinking that the mere presence of our ships will deter them. Unfortunately, it did not. The enemy laid siege to Sevastopol and the navy scuttled ships to block the harbour and reuse the cannons in defence of the city. After the scuttling, the navy lost all control of the Black Sea, we were unable to contest any landings nor sink their supply ships. Along with the report on the naval failings, we also brought ideas and various studies on the naval action of the war so that our navy knows how to prevent another repeat of the Crimean war if we ever have to fight another big naval power."

 RUS_idea_russian_corruption1: "Russian Corruption"
 RUS_idea_russian_corruption1_desc: "In 1857, corruption is rampant in the Russian Empire, permeating every level of government and society. Bribery, nepotism, and embezzlement are widespread, with officials and bureaucrats often prioritizing personal gain over the public good. This corruption has serious consequences for the functioning of the government and the wellbeing of the population.\n\nAt the highest levels of government, corruption is particularly prevalent. Powerful nobles and bureaucrats use their influence and connections to secure lucrative positions and contracts, often at the expense of more deserving candidates. This leads to a system of patronage and cronyism, with positions and resources allocated based on personal connections rather than merit. As a result, many talented individuals are excluded from positions of power and influence, hindering the development of the country.\n\nCorruption also impacts the daily lives of ordinary Russians. Officials at all levels of government demand bribes for even basic services, such as obtaining permits or licenses. This creates a system of "red tape" and delays, with many people forced to pay bribes simply to navigate the bureaucracy.

However, both systems suffer from similar issues, including the influence of the state and nobility over the judiciary, as well as insufficient funding and resources.\n\nThe criminal court is particularly ineffective, with trials often being conducted in secret and verdicts based on limited evidence. The use of torture to extract confessions is widespread, and sentences are often severe, with capital punishment being the most common penalty.

Moreover, the judicial system is inaccessible to the majority of the population, as legal representation is expensive and often not available outside of major cities.\n\nAs a result, the Russian Empire's judicial system fails to provide a fair and impartial justice system to its citizens, and instead perpetuates a system of injustice and oppression. The lack of accountability and transparency in the judiciary undermines the rule of law, and further contributes to the growing discontent and unrest among the population.

 RUS_idea_caucasuswar: "The Caucasian War"
 RUS_idea_caucasuswar_desc: "In 1857, the Russian Empire is embroiled in the Caucasian War, a long and bloody conflict against the various tribes of the Caucasus region. The war has been raging for several decades, with both sides engaging in brutal fighting and committing atrocities. The Russian Empire seeks to expand its territory and control over the region, while the various tribes resist this encroachment on their land and way of life.\n\nThe conflict is characterized by guerrilla warfare, with the tribes using hit-and-run tactics to harass Russian forces and disrupt their supply lines. The Russian Empire responds with overwhelming force, employing modern weaponry and large armies to crush the tribal resistance. Despite the use of force, the conflict remains protracted and brutal, with neither side gaining a decisive advantage. The war is also complicated by the involvement of various outside powers, such as Britain and Turkey, who seek to influence the outcome of the conflict.\n\nThe consequences of the Caucasian War are significant, both for the Russian Empire and the peoples of the Caucasus. The war has led to the annexation of large parts of the region, with the Russian Empire seeking to establish control over the area. However, the conflict has also led to the displacement and resettlement of many of the local tribes, with their way of life and cultural traditions severely impacted. The Caucasus region remains a hotbed of conflict and tension to this day, with the legacy of the Caucasian War continuing to shape the political and social landscape of the area."
 RUS_idea_tsarist_vodka_monopoly: "Tsarist Vodka Monopoly"
 RUS_idea_tsarist_vodka_monopoly_desc: "Ever since Ivan IV enforced a state monopoly over the vodka industry, Russian Tsars have greatly profited from the sale of vodka – the monetary benefits of this monopoly were so great that sometimes the lower nobles were rewarded vodka production rights instead of land or any other legal privileges. Sadly, vodka itself has had a damaging effect on the Russian society, for it is a poison to the soul and body. Whereas the western societies are energetic and ambitious, our society is subdued by this sinful drink. Alcohol is deeply rooted in Russian culture and it'll take great effort to change this fact."

The ranks are primarily based on an individual's occupation, with the highest rank being General Field Marshal reserved for the Emperor and members of the royal family, and the lowest being Collegiate Secretary, the entry-level rank for civil servants. Advancement through the ranks requires exceptional performance in the current role, passing rigorous exams, and is also influenced by an individual's social status and connections.\n\nThe Table of Ranks serves as a means of maintaining social order in the Russian Empire.

 RUS_idea_granary: "Granary Of Europe"
 RUS_idea_granary_desc: "During the reign of Alexander II in 1857, the Russian Empire is known as the "Granary of Europe" due to its vast agricultural output. The empire's fertile land, abundant natural resources, and large rural population allow for the production of large quantities of grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye, as well as other crops, such as potatoes and sugar beets. This agricultural output not only sustains the empire's own population, but also provides a vital source of food for the rest of Europe.\n\nThe development of large-scale farming techniques, including the use of mechanization and crop rotation, helps to increase the efficiency and productivity of Russian agriculture. The empire's vast railway network also allows for the rapid transportation of goods from rural areas to urban centers and ports, facilitating the export of grains and other agricultural products to other countries. The importance of Russian agriculture to the European economy is reflected in the empire's role as a major supplier of grains to countries such as Great Britain and Germany.\n\nHowever, the "Granary of Europe" title belies the deep-seated issues and inequalities within Russian agriculture. The majority of the rural population are poor peasants, who are subject to harsh working conditions and often struggle to make ends meet. Moreover, the land is largely owned by wealthy landlords, who often exploit their tenants and workers for their own gain. The agricultural system is also heavily reliant on serfdom, with many peasants being tied to the land and unable to leave their place of birth. Despite these challenges, Russian agriculture remains a vital component of the empire's economy and a major contributor to the European food supply."

 RUS_vic_Avoiding_Coalitions_desc: "During the reign of Alexander II in 1857, the Russian Empire employs a policy of avoiding alliances with other major powers in Europe. This policy is driven by the desire to maintain Russian sovereignty and to avoid being drawn into international conflicts. The empire's diplomatic efforts focus on maintaining friendly relations with neighboring countries, while avoiding any formal military alliances.\n\nRussia's position as a major power, with a large army and vast territory, means that the country is viewed with suspicion by other European powers. The fear of being encircled by a coalition of enemies, as happened during the Napoleonic Wars, leads the Russian leadership to take a cautious approach to international relations. Instead of seeking out allies, Russia prioritizes strengthening its own military and diplomatic capabilities, and promoting its interests through bilateral agreements and informal alliances.\n\nDespite this policy of avoiding formal coalitions, Russia is still involved in a number of international disputes, including conflicts over the Balkans and the Caucasus. The empire's efforts to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors are often undermined by these conflicts, as well as by the imperialist ambitions of other European powers. Nonetheless, the avoidance of formal alliances allows Russia to maintain a degree of independence and flexibility in its foreign policy, while also reducing the risk of being drawn into a wider conflict."

 RUS_vic_crimean_war_outcome_desc: "In 1853 we tried to exert our rightful role as protector of the Orthodox inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire, but the Ottomans betrayed their promise and forced our hand against them. We were assaulted by the greatest armies assembled since the time of Napoleon, and betrayed by our supposed allies, the Austrians. Our armies were damaged and humiliated, our treasury drained, and we even lost the right to possess a navy in the Black Sea, or to fortify our own lands that border that sea. These terms have shamed us since they were signed, but they have shown us that the current state is unsustainable. We must change our nation, our army, and our navy to be able to survive and compete against our enemies. If we fail to change, then the world around us will destroy us, just as it threatened to in the past."

 RUS_vic_horrors_crimean_war_desc: "The Crimean War has forever changed war for the Russian people. We will never forget what happened to our soldiers, and how they came back changed. These soldiers carry the memory of the brutal battles they saw in Crimea with them each day. They are forever affected by trench madness, their wounds, the remnants of their disease, and even by the harshness of the winter itself. While the suffering of these veterans is to be honored, they must be the last to experience this, and in the future we will create a world where no soldier will need to suffer as much."
 RUS_vic_steam_armored_fleet: "Transition to Steam Armored Fleet"
 RUS_vic_steam_armored_fleet_desc: "Our fleet is aged, and yet it is still powerful and large. However, we cannot simply sit and appreciate the size and might of our Pacific Fleet or the Baltic Fleet. Instead, we must move forward, and adopt the modern advancements in steam power that grants speeds never before seen to ships. These advancements hold the potential to allow our navies to meet together far faster than would ever have been possible in the past, though such a maneuver being effective still seems like a far off dream today."
 RUS_vic_armored_steam_tactics: "Armored Steam Fleet Tactics"
 RUS_vic_armored_steam_tactics_desc: "Our fleet has been drastically improved from its previous state, and now even holds armored warships. And yet, we have not worked out our doctrines with such ships. We now have a great fleet, and yet we do not yet know how to use it.

 RUS_vic_marine_technical_committee: "Marine Technical Committee"
 RUS_vic_marine_technical_committee_desc: "We will organize a committee of experts in order to develop our shipbuilding program. Their task will be to decide what ships we should construct in order to meet our goals, where, and using what methods.

 RUS_vic_nevskiy_factory: "Nevskiy Factory"
 RUS_vic_nevskiy_factory_desc: "Let us found a new shipbuilding plant to supplement our ability to construct new ships. Our demand has grown greater, and our current capabilities will be insufficient.

The wonders that will come out of this shipyard will be the pride of our navy, and all will see the great fleet we produce."

 RUS_vic_first_battleship: "The First Naval Battleship"

One of the greatest is the creation of the Battleship, a fully armored ship of immense size and power that is still faster than many ships that came before it. If we truly wish to have a navy which can compete with our rivals, we must construct such a ship of our own before we are completely outmatched."
 RUS_vic_far_eastern_navy: "Beginning of a Far Eastern Navy"
 RUS_vic_far_eastern_navy_desc: "For too long has the east been neglected. Although our nation has previously lacked the interest or ability to exploit the full worth of our eastern coast, this is no longer the case. We will immediately begin taking steps towards creating a force capable of dominating the area, beginning with the reorganization of our current forces, expansion of our bases, and the construction of new ships.

 RUS_vic_eastern_bases: "Military Bases in the East"
 RUS_vic_eastern_bases_desc: "Our western naval bases are often our primary focus, as they serve our largest fleets and protect our most important trade routes. However, the wealth of our eastern lands is growing, and if we improved our bases a great fleet could be built in the east. This could grant us control of the trade in these wealthy seas."
 RUS_vic_force_sea_of_japan: "A Force in the Sea of Japan"
 RUS_vic_force_sea_of_japan_desc: "No other European power holds the number of ports in the Sea of Japan as we do, and our direct land connection truly solidifies this position.

 RUS_vic_shipbuilding_program_1876_desc: "Having organized factories and reformed our naval operations, it is time to begin a new batch of ship constructions. Our navy must grow or else it will be surpassed, and yet we must also ensure that the ships that we construct are of a good quality, and able to compete in ability rather than just numbers. Our factories should be to produce enough ships to fill our needs, and if need be the option to purchase ships is always available."
 RUS_vic_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 RUS_vic_naval_academy_desc: "Although we possess the Advanced Officer's Class, Russia has no Naval Academy. Despite this, the existence of the Advanced Officer's Class makes this issue very easy to resolve. We will create a formal Naval Academy on a new scale by using the experienced teachers of the Advanced Officer's Class as the foundation, and begin a new endeavor to teach a great new generation of formally trained officers."

 RUS_vic_dissolve_cantonists: "Dissolve Cantonists"
 RUS_vic_dissolve_cantonists_desc: "Since 1721 we have made use of the Cantonists, the young sons of our conscripts who received an education in the same career as their fathers. However, the lack of results from these long efforts, and the public condemnation the practice has received have now forced our hand. We can no longer justify this practice, and we will simply dissolve the system, allowing the young boys to return home and decide their own path in life."
 RUS_vic_abolish_inhumane_punishment: "Abolish Inhumane Punishment"
 RUS_vic_abolish_inhumane_punishment_desc: "With the Cantonists dissolved, perhaps it is the time to remove other immoral aspects from our military. We will begin with the punishments we inflict on our soldiers. While across Europe most nations have abandoned punishments such as branding, whipping, we have continued with such practices, and even have our own such as the infamous gauntlet. However, experience and the belief of our theorists have pushed us away from such traditions, and we will formally abolish those practices once and for all."
 RUS_vic_visit_prussian_military_staff: "Visit to the Prussian Military Staff"
 RUS_vic_visit_prussian_military_staff_desc: "The Prussian Staff is truly extraordinary, pioneering new ways of thinking about war, and we have much to learn from them. We have long had contact with the military of Prussia, though not always on the same side, but their ability cannot be doubted.

 RUS_vic_military_justice_reform: "Military-Justice Reform"
 RUS_vic_military_justice_reform_desc: "Having begun reforms on our punishments, we should also begin to reform our system of Military Justice. We must reconsider what our soldiers can and should be punished for, and how best to maintain discipline and morale at their best states. We should look to our neighbors and allies to learn of their methods, and see what can be learned from their experience with military justice."
 RUS_vic_change_uniforms: "A Change in the Uniforms"

 RUS_vic_alexander_military_law_academy: "The Alexander Military Law Academy"
 RUS_vic_alexander_military_law_academy_desc: "In order to ensure that justice is truly delivered, we will form a new academy to educate our officers in justice. It will create a large group of officers capable of filling judicial roles in our military in a far more professional and formalized manner than was previously possible. These officers will be our instruments for justice, and should bring it to our armies."
 RUS_vic_women_medical_courses: "Medical Courses for Women"
 RUS_vic_women_medical_courses_desc: "Our military has rarely held any roles for women, and even fewer in an official way, and yet this is now changing. We have found that employing women in non-combat roles, particularly medical roles, can benefit our military. Such roles have been known for many years, but became most pronounced during the Crimean War. We will formally institute education to enable these roles permanently, hopefully saving many of our soldiers' lives."
 RUS_vic_conscription_1874: "Conscription Statue of [GetYear]"
 RUS_vic_conscription_1874_desc: "Our previous laws of conscription were both too harsh, and too riddled with exemptions. We will promulgate a new statute on universal military duty, and establish six-year terms for service, service across all levels of society, and a clear and simple system of exemptions.

 ###Milyutin Army Reform###
 RUS_decision_category_milyutin_reforms: "Dmitry Milyutin's Army Reform"
 RUS_decision_category_milyutin_reforms_desc: "Our defeat in the Crimean war was brought to us because of our disorganized and obsolete military, which was pretty much the same as 50 years before - in the times of Napoleon! No one doubts that we defeated him, but more than 40 years of stagnation aren't healthy for anything. This mustn't last any longer, and that's why our new Minister of War, Dmitry Milytin, made an extensive report, which declared new goals for the Russian military: reorganize the army structure, make it smaller at expense of the non-combat units, make mobilization go faster and units get to their combat state quicker, make army less bulky in times of peace, create the system of military districts, arrange rearmament, make soldiers more literate and so on. Some reforms can be fired at the same time, but consequences will be more harsh then usual ones and will last longer."

 RUS_decision_mayevskys_artillery_desc: "Our cannons are still produced by the standards of the beginning of the century, while there were many innovations secured by the Western powers. One of those would be rifled guns with new construction, still loading from the front but having more accuracy and firing range, proposed by N.V. Mayevsky."
 RUS_decision_baranovskys_artillery: "Baranovsky's Artillery Model"
 RUS_decision_baranovskys_artillery_desc: "Despite having pretty good rifled cannons of Mayevsky construction, we still need the newer ones, as advancements in artillery technologies go even hastier than before. That's why V.S. Baranovsky made a new cannon... and it's surprisingly good! Every foreign spy is trying to get to know how we managed to do it, but this gun caused a new wave of innovations just by appearing!"
 RUS_decision_new_military_districts: "New Military Districts"
 RUS_decision_new_military_districts_desc: "Our army is too vast and hierarchial to manage it in the times of peace, so Milyutin proposed a new system of organization - military districts will take place of the armies, while armies and army corps are no longer present without war. This will help us to get rid of excessive administrative expenses on the upkeep of those thousands of officers."
 RUS_decision_medical_corps: "Medical Corps"
 RUS_decision_medical_corps_desc: "Medical Corps is a new institution in Russian Imperial Army, which aims to make soldiers more healthy and lower the rate of non-combat losses. It isn't too efficient, because our doctors still aren't that educated as they should be, but at least we are trying to ease the life of our soldiers in their camps and make more wounded come back to arms and less cripples come to their homes."

 RUS_decision_austro_italo_french_war_desc: "Despite our neutral cause in the recently broken Austro-Italo-French war, we want France to consider us friendly, that's why we stationed some of our troops on the border of the traitorous Austria, to help the French in their war. Also we sent military observers, in other words - legal spies - to the warring states, overlooking Austrian, Sardinian and French armies, extorting new experience from that and finding out, how real army is organized, to prepare our army for the reforms."

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_II_DESC: "Born in the great city of Moscow, 1818, Alexander II  (born Alexander Nikolayevich) was the eldest son and heir of Tsar Nicholas I and his spouse, Princess Charlotte of Prussia. His parent's marriage, despite being formed purely for political purposes amongst the Russian and Prussian royalty, was a prosperous one. From birth, Alexander was given the title of Tsesarevich, which has been traditionally given to the heirs of the Russian throne.\n\n The upbringing and early education of Alexander seemed inconducive to creating a great reformer. Indeed, the opposite, as currently seen throughout Russia, was true. At the time of his upbringing, the court and political atmosphere was intensely conservative under his father's authoritarian rule. Dissent from any corner, regardless of rank, was severely punishable. Even Alexander, who was dearest to his family and all of Russia, was cautious around his belligerent father.\n\n Alexander's father was nothing if not practical in the upbringing of his successor. Nicholas had an uneventful upbringing as merely a second to the throne. He was determined to not let Alexander suffer the same fate and provided him with tutors, such as the great reformer Mikhail Speransky and romantic poet Vasily Zhukovsky, as well as military advisor General Karl Merder. This combination led to Alexander being well-prepared and more liberal than his father. \n\n While traversing Western Europe in 1839, Alexander was in search of a royal wife. After a stop in Baden where his parents were advocates for the marriage of the princess, but the Tsesarevich showed no interest, an unexpected stop in Hesse proved well as he would find love in Duke Ludwig IIs Daughter, Marie. Despite some early objections from his mother and a long engagement because of Marie's youth, Alexander and Marie married on April 28, 1841. Their first child, the Grand Duchess Alexandra, was born in August 1842 but died of meningitis at a young age. In September 1843, Nicholas was born and was deemed heir, then followed in 1845 by Alexander, Vladimir in 1847, and Alexei in 1850. \n\n Alexander has shed some light on the crippled and corrupted state of Russia after the fallout of the Crimean War some years ago. Still ongoing, the Tsar has been pushing for liberation of Serfdom across the state, with many more reforms expected."

 pr_total_desc: "In 1857, Tsar Alexander II is implementing a series of reforms aimed at modernizing and liberalizing the Russian Empire. These reforms include the emancipation of serfs, the establishment of local self-government, the creation of an independent judiciary, and the expansion of educational opportunities.\nThe Emancipation Reform, which was enacted in 1861, frees the serfs from their landlords and allows them to own land and marry without their lord's permission. This move aims to abolish the feudal-like system that has been in place for centuries, which was stifling Russia's economic and social progress.\nIn addition to the Emancipation Reform, Alexander II establishes elected assemblies in rural areas and cities, giving the people more say in local government. He also creates an independent judiciary to ensure justice and fairness for all, regardless of social status.\nFurthermore, the Tsar expands educational opportunities, particularly for women, by creating more schools and universities. The goal is to provide a more skilled and educated workforce, which will help modernize the economy and society.\nOverall, Alexander II's reforms aim to modernize and liberalize the Russian Empire, paving the way for future progress and development."
