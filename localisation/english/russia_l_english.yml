Flocked by a large entourage of noblemen and attendants, Alexander only found a certain amount of reprieve for himself from the crowd when he stood to gaze, captivated, upon the beauty of some of the oldest fountains to be found in all of Russia.\n\nAs the Emperor's tour of Peter the Great's creation drew to a close, he made his way toward the large gate that marked the entrance of the Garden, stopping to remark at its fine artistry as a crowd of onlookers began to assemble around him."

In a desperate attempt, the revolutionary pulled out a double-barreled shotgun and trained his aim at the Emperor...and fired.\n\nAlexander jolted about when he heard the discharge of the weapon. He was still alive. Luckily, at just the right moment, the revolutionary's attempt was thwarted by the valiant interruption of no other than a peasant-born hatter's apprentice by the name of Ossip Komissarov, who jostled the revolutionary's arm just as he was about to fire.\n\nThe assailant, shocked by Komissarov, attempted to flee the scene, but he was immediately intercepted by the royal guard. The guards wrested his weapon away from him and confiscated what appeared to be morphine and strychnine to kill himself with, along with prussic acid to disfigure his face. Alexander approached the assailant, and angrily asked him 'What do you want?' The shocked assailant only mumbled back to him 'Nothing, nothing,' before being taken away.\n\nThe identity of the assailant has been revealed to be Dmitry Karakozov, a former student and a member of the revolutionary students' organization known as the Ishutin Society, led by Nikolai Ishutin. He has been locked away in the Peter and Paul Fortress awaiting his punishment, but he begs for forgiveness and even offers to convert to Orthodoxy."

 rossiya.18.t: "Alexander II Has Been Assassinated!"
 rossiya.18.d_1: "Unbeknownst to Alexander II and his entourage, a young revolutionary slipped through the crowd that had gathered around him at the gate of the St. Petersburg Summer Garden. In a desperate attempt, the revolutionary pulled out a double-barreled shotgun and trained his aim at the Emperor...and fired.\n\nThe beloved Emperor collapsed into the hands of his attendants as the impact of the shotgun shells ripped into his chest, spilling blood all over his uniform and the noblemen around him. The assailant ducked his weapon back into his coat and attempted to flee the scene, but was quickly accosted by the guards and taken away.\n\nAs the crowds gathered around to gaze in horror at their wounded Emperor, the guards desperately attempted to disperse the crowds as a carriage rode up to take him away to the Winter Palace. As the carriage fled the scene, the condition Alexander worsened severely, as he began to cough up blood and grow extremely pale and weak. Although the doctors attending to him tried everything in their power to stop the bleeding, the Emperor took his last breath just as his carriage screeched to a halt outside of his residence.

 rossiya.26.a: "Medics!"
 rossiya.27.t: "Investigation of Alexander's Assassination"
 rossiya.27.d: "We have managed to capture both assassins although one of them is gravely injured by his own bomb.

 rossiya.27.a: "If we find them, we can put an end to them!"

 rossiya.28.t: "Successful Investigation"

 #GENERAL INFO AND FLAVOUR EVENTS

The war started in the Balkans in July 1853, when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities, which were under Ottoman suzerainty, then began to cross the Danube. Led by Omar Pasha, the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the advance at Silistra. The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts in which the military used modern technologies such as explosive naval shells, railways, and telegraphs. The war was one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and photographs.

There is clearly a new power eager to step into Austria’s shoes; The Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont. It has played its cards well so far by allying with another of Austria’s arch-rivals, France. Maybe Russia could play a hand in here as well?"
 rossiya.52.a: "Interesting."
 rossiya.53.t: "The Gorky Library is Established"

However, during the majority of the rule of Nicholas I, the Russian Imperial government lacked the funds to construct any public library whatsoever, so it was not until today that the first public library in the oblast of Ryazan was built, the Gorky Library. Being based in the populated and influential city of Gorky, it was the clear choice, also in part thanks to the many wealthy and educated patrons funding the project."
 rossiya.53.a: "Perhaps a stop by?"
 rossiya.54.t: "Kyiv Police Department"

The Cathedral and Square gained their name from Saint Isaac of Dalmatia, a patron saint of Peter the Great, who had been born on the feast day of that saint.

Most disturbing are the reports that the Tilgul embankment itself is in a bad shape and locals are even surprised that this disaster hasn’t happened earlier!

 #DOMESTIC POLITICS
 rossiya.201.t: "Germans Immigrate To The Volga Region"
 rossiya.201.d: "Over the past few months, the Russian Empire has seen a substantial amount of German migrants settling in the Volga Region east of Moscow. While the Tsars and their advisors have traditionally been sceptical of foreigners immigrating into their feudal nation, as Serfdom becomes less reliable, these new Germanic vagrants could prove quite useful in developing and modernizing our nation in the coming years."
 rossiya.201.a: "We shall make good use of them!"
 rossiya.202.t: "New Minister of War Appointed"
 rossiya.202.d: "It wasn't a long time ago, since enemy forces invaded our motherland, the first time since the Napoleonic Wars! Our army fought bravely but this time we lost. Now we have to consider new reforms to improve it. \n\nAfter the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, the Minister of War, Count Dmitry Milyutin, (who held the post from 16 May 1861 to 21 May 1881) introduced many much-needed reforms. The reforms carried on during Milyutin's long tenure abolished the system where children were conscripted and resulted in the levy system being introduced in Russia and military districts being created across the country. The system of military education was also reformed, and elementary education was made available to all the draftees. Milyutin's reforms are regarded as a milestone in the history of Russia: they dispensed with the military recruitment and professional army introduced by Peter the Great and created the Russian army as it continued into the 21st century. Up to Dmitry Milyutin's reforms in 1874, the Russian Army had no permanent barracks and was billeted in dugouts and shacks."
 rossiya.202.a: "Let's hope he serves well."
 rossiya.203.t: "Reign of Alexander II"
 rossiya.203.d: "On September 7th, 1856 Tsar Alexander II was coronated at the Dormition Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin. A younger and more enlightened ruler, Alexander would seek to modernize Russia both economically and socially through a variety of bold reforms. He would do away with the archaic and brutal system of Serfdom in 1861, earning him the title of "The Liberator" by those he emancipated. Only time will tell if he will lead his great nation to the future, however, as the dark forces of the Imperial Court could turn him into nothing more than another regressive reactionary..."
 rossiya.203.a: "Long may he reign!"
 rossiya.204.t: "Michael von Reutern"
 rossiya.204.d: "A skilled German economist from the Baltic duchies has emerged as a prime candidate to guide our financial policy. While not of Russian blood, Michael Von Reutern is still a cut above the other potential candidates. Now would be the ideal time to hire his services"
 rossiya.204.a: "Let us Hire him immediately"
 rossiya.205.t: "Alexander Gorchakov"
 rossiya.205.d: "The office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs is vacant, and only one man has shown the skills it takes to occupy such a prestigious position."
 rossiya.205.a: "Gorchakov it is then!"
 rossiya.206.t: "Viktor Panin"

 rossiya.206.a: "Absolutely!"
 rossiya.207.t: "The Okhrana"
 rossiya.207.d: "Following recent plots against our dearest leader and his regime, the Tsar has decided that enough is enough. From now on, the Okhrana will serve as our eyes and ears on the streets, a secret police dedicated to silence anyone and everyone who schemes against us in the shadows."
 rossiya.207.a: "Death to traitors!"
 rossiya.208.t: "The Imperial Security Service"
 rossiya.208.d: "The borderlands of Mother Russia have grown increasingly dangerous as of late, with bandits and marauders plundering and pillaging our frontier settlements. Thus a reform of our internal security policy is necessary, one that will greatly expand its powers to a functional and professional enforcer of the law."
 rossiya.208.a: "The ISS shall serve us well"
 rossiya.209.t: "The Russian European Empire"
 rossiya.209.d: "Over the past few centuries, The Russian Empire has greatly expanded its borders and during the recent major conflicts most of its gains were made in Europe. Our most westward territories are home to the Polish. A catholic nation, which isn't afraid to fight for its independence. Their homeland is also inhabited by Germans and Jews. To the north lies Finland, a protestant country with a rising national identity. The Baltic Sea coastline is inhabited by Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians, and also by Germans, which have lived here since the times of the Livonian Order. With such a diverse population we'll have to carefully plan, actively fighting separatism and other revolutionary ideas, which seek to overthrow our just and legitimate rule."
 rossiya.209.a: "For Mother Russia!"
 rossiya.210.t: "End of Russification in European Russia"
 rossiya.210.d: "The once-proud peoples of Poland and Ukraine have seen the light as ethnic Russians and abandoned their old and archaic roots and past glories. No longer shall they be burdered with their own culture and language. As true Russians, they are no longer occupied peoples but rather core parts of the greatest nation on earth."
 rossiya.210.a: "Wonderful!"
 rossiya.211.t: "Socialist Magazine Iskra is published"
 rossiya.211.d: "The first publication of the socialist magazine Iskra was published today in St. Petersburg. These liberals are spouting lies about our country, and indoctrinating others. We may have to speak with the editors soon."
 rossiya.211.a: "Communist Dogs!"
 rossiya.212.t: "Mahtra Estate Revolt"
 rossiya.212.d: "Though the Russian Baltic hasn't seen serfdom since its abolishment in 1816, peasant unrest is high even in this region. It has been slowly boiling since the Manifesto of Tsar Alexander II from March 19 1856, when larger agrarian reforms were promised but implementation was slow, and now peasants from the Mahtra estate in Estonia are in rebellion against our rule! Troops were sent to restore order..."
 rossiya.212.a: "What? A peasant revolt? Are we in Pugachev's times again?"
 rossiya.213.t: "Mahtra Revolt Ends"
 rossiya.213.d: "Nearly two months ago, unrest among the peasantry caused a rebellion against the Tsar on the Mahtra estate of the Estonian governorate. It has been handled by the regular garrison army, resulting in 14 wounded and seven casualites, three of the wounded peasants died while in hospital. The battle did not go without our own loss: our company suffered some casualties — 13 wounded soldiers and one officer killed. 60 of the 65 peasant prisoners were sentenced to death by our court-martial in Tallinn, although the Baltic governor-general Suvorov will likely reduce most of these sentences to corporal punishment, or to leave to Siberia in exile. This revolt was crushed easily by our army, but we need to be on the lookout for insurrections in the future."
 rossiya.213.a: "Let them be!"
 rossiya.213.b: "Send them to the Siberia!"
 rossiya.213.c: "Execute them!"
 rossiya.214.t: "Bezdna Uprising"
 rossiya.214.d: "The peasants of the village of Bezdna have risen up against serfdom. Unfortunately, the great news of emancipation has not yet reached them. The soldiers of the Kazan Governate were rushed to restore order around the village, leading to bloody battles that left dozens of peasants and 20 soldiers dead. We have replaced the governor of Kazan to make sure that something like this will never happen again."
 rossiya.214.a: "Crush them!"
 rossiya.215.t: "Les Miserables is banned"
 rossiya.215.d: "While Victor Hugo's book 'Les Miserables' is a masterpiece even read by monarchs all over the world, it should not be shown to the public eye now that it is translated, your highness. Reading the book may give those foolish peasants the wrong idea if you know what I mean. -All of Alexander II's Advisors."
 rossiya.215.a: "Ignorance is Strength"
 rossiya.216.t: "What is to be Done?"
 rossiya.216.d: "The book 'What is to be Done?' by the radical writer Nikolai Chernyshevsky was smuggled out of the great fortress of St. Peter and Paul where he lays imprisoned. The novel mentions the outlandish ideas of collective farms owned by the peasants, as if we would allow something like this to ever happen. Don't worry your highness, we'll make sure to suppress these revolutionary ideas before the word spreads to the masses. We should also deal with Socialist Philosopher Chernyshevsky, his ideals are spreading quickly to the peoples, becoming a nuisance on our stability.."
 rossiya.216.a: "Burn it!"
 rossiya.217.t: "'Young Russia' is published"
 rossiya.217.d: "A group of students have published an article titled 'Young Russia' today. The article states that reform is necessary to survive as a country, and the optimal method for reform is a revolution of the people, and total seizure of power away from us, the monarchs."
 rossiya.217.a: "Crush them!"
 rossiya.218.t: "Censoring 'Fathers and Sons'?"
 rossiya.218.d: "'Russian Bulletin' has sent its new March-April issue to the Censor Department. That would be a usual publication if it hadn't the new Turgenev's novel inside, called 'Fathers and Sons'. Its idea is rotating around nihilism, an ideology of denial of every authority and even somewhat revolutionary! It can be dangerous enough for our aristocracy which already supports liberal ideas. We can give the order - and this book will be completely different, but Turgenev will be completely disappointed in our government. He is one of the most loyal writers of our Motherland and it would be a tall loss. But what if we go soft with this novel and just let it be? Of course, there will be some mimics who will call themselves 'nihilists', but... isn't it what we want to make them think? Just ensure that they are loyal, being initiative and innovative isn't a crime in Russia."
 rossiya.218.a: "Let's not be strict, it's not the Nikolay era after all."
 rossiya.218.b: "Better censure this 'Nihilism', else we can suffer from crazy idealists raised on that book..."
 rossiya.219.t: "Censorship of 'Fathers and Sons' Revealed"
 rossiya.219.d: "When the novel about Evgeniy Bazarov has just been written by Turgenev, we decided to censor it heavily, remove all questionable themes and never return to this. But due to the end of the Censor Department, following the new law about the press, the real book has been revealed! Now people are blaming us for hiding that 'masterpiece' from them. That led to us losing some positions in government and, what is worrying - 'nihilism' starts to spread through our population!"
 rossiya.219.a: "What a shame..."
 rossiya.220.t: "Publishment of 'Crime and Punishment'"
 rossiya.220.d: "Fyodor Dostoevsky has written a new book, called 'Crime and Punishment'. It tells about a poor Russian student, Rodion Raskolnikov, who tries to survive in Saint Petersburg and lends his old but only kettle to the old woman, who was a money lender. He says that this is unfair and kills her along with her silly-minded sister and then tries to merge his philosophy theory about 'the ones who have the right and the ones who don't' with the fact of murder. When he founds his love and starts a more active life, meeting many people, his conscience begins to rise slowly, leading him to surrendering to police and going to penal colony in Siberia. His love follows him and there he finally finds his salvation, throws out his ideas and starts a new life with his woman. This book, being published now in the 'Russian Bulletin', is close to the title of masterpiece and doesn't really tell about any political ideas, so we can just let it be."
 rossiya.220.a: "Worth of reading in spare time - Dostoevsky wrote a good piece!"
 rossiya.221.t: "A New Court Statute"
 rossiya.221.d: "The reform provided for a complete change in the judiciary, with the creation of two branches of courts - world and general judicial institutions, each of which had two instances (magistrates and world congresses; district courts and judicial chambers) and Cassation departments of the Senate as a common third instance."
 rossiya.221.a: "The Judge, the Jury, the Executioner."
 rossiya.222.t: "Improvement of The Criminal Trial"
 rossiya.222.d: "The reform significantly changed the principles and procedures of legal proceedings: the court became public, open and oral, with an adversarial process in which the parties received equal rights to provide and refute evidence; a judicial investigation was introduced into the criminal process, at which the data of the preliminary investigation were checked."
 rossiya.222.a: "Justice will be done."
 rossiya.223.t: "Justice of Peace"
 rossiya.223.d: "The magistrates considered: civil claims in the amount of not more than 500 rubles, claims for personal insults and insults, claims for the restoration of violated possession; cases on charges of misdemeanors, the punishment for which could be a reprimand, a fine in the amount of not more than 300 rubles, arrest for a period not exceeding 3 months, imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year. In practice, this meant that the largest criminal cases that came to justice of the peace were thefts."
 rossiya.223.a: "Now people will go to criminal or civil courts if act against the law."
 rossiya.224.t: "The Jury Trial"
 rossiya.224.d: "The jury institute was created convened for the trial of those accused of serious criminal offenses. The consideration of the case in the courts was limited to two instances (first and appeal), for the jury - one instance, and for all cases - one instance of cassation. The judiciary was completely separated from the administrative; the judicial investigation was separated from the police and became procedurally independent."
 rossiya.224.a: "A jury to decide on innocence."
 rossiya.225.t: "Expert Legal Assistance"
 rossiya.225.d: "Attorneys at law were private lawyers organized into corporations ( estates ) by judicial districts; they could have assistants who were not part of the corporation, but who had the right to perform all their functions. To be accepted as a sworn attorney, one had to have a specialized higher education and five years of work experience, either in judicial institutions, or as an assistant to a sworn attorney. The barristers' estate of the judicial district was headed by an elected council of barristers . The board admitted new members to the corporation, could reprimand attorneys, temporarily suspend their activities and expel them from the corporation. Attorneys at law could act only in the courts of the district in which they were members."

They returned home in 1863, immediately establishing contacts with political prisoners and Polish people who were exiled after their recent rebellion. They were gathering forces and money to incite revolt in Siberia, but their plot was uncovered recently. Forty-four members of the group were arrested and taken to prison by Russian law enforcement after watch officers of the Siberian Cadet Corps searched cadet Arseny Samsonov, aged 16, for illicit items and found a proclamation entitled 'To Patriots of Siberia', attributed to the collective authorship of G. Potanin, N. Yadrintsev, and other leaders of the movement. Now, all of them have been sent to various places around the country for either penal labor or exile, ensuring that we won't hear of them revolting again. Their ideas got some foothold within minds of local the bourgeoisie in Tomsk, Tobolsk, and Irkutsk, but that doesn't matter, because no one questions our authority in those lands anymore."

This factory is massive and maybe the largest in the world. Employing 12,000 people, and owning 32,000 acres of land, Knoop will surely be a very powerful man, important to our economy, and it is in our best interest that we keep him on our good side."
 rossiya.501.a: "Excellent"
 rossiya.502.t: "Protests Against Vodka!"
 rossiya.502.d: "Prices for alcohol have always been relatively low in Russia since the times of Ivan IV, but over the recent years that prices increased gradually. In the 1830's to 1840's prices had risen to 2-3 rubles per bucket of vodka. This money is also a price for a calf.\nNow it became even worse, as prices for vodka have risen three times as large as they were in the 1850 year. This is because Russia needs to replenish its depleted budget after the Crimean War, but also it causes instability in our states, especially among the poor. Protests against that policy originally started in Kovno Governorate, in Lithuania, where local villagers took oaths to abstain from drinking any high-degree alcohol except for "medicinal purposes". However, wine and beer are still permitted. Locals, supported by the Catholic clergy, established chapters of the Brotherhood of Sobriety, a temperance society that originated in Silesia and has support from the Pope himself. That was at the end of the 1858 year\nFew months ago the situation has become even worse - peasants all around the Empire are taking oaths of abstention from vodka. Boycotts were in 91 uyezds (an area that is part of the governorate) of 32 governorates. Sales of alcohol dramatically decreased, with vodka prices dropped in 16-20 times and retailers sometimes offering vodka for free. Now members of temperance societies attack taverns and destroy alcohol stockpiles. This is going beyond the borders of good and bad..."

Warsaw is the heart of our Polish territories, and St. Petersburg our capital. This will help better facilitate the transport of our troops across the country, and greatly improve our economy. The construction of greater infrastructure and railroads is something that we need to accomplish to lead our way towards industralization and to nurture the wounds from the Crimean War."

 rossiya.507.d: "Since 1725, when Peter the Great installed the Soul Tax, there have been many incidents happening in the motherland: crises, wars, and industrial advancements has changed the world and Russia as well. Now the Soul Tax became mostly obsolete even in a modernized state. Hence why the government is adamantly pushing to discuss it with the respective Zemstvos of the Russian Governorates. Half support graduating from lower to higher income tax which will be levied upon all the population and will leave the tax income on state budget the same, the outcome being peasants and commoners living better in cost of nobility cash. Some other commissions supported the usual income tax, but only for merchants, and some additional taxes on the nobility and peasants. The idea barley made it through, as it was laughed at due to its ineffectiveness, with the central government shutting it down almost immediately. Finally, one more proposal: property taxes instead of both soul and income taxes. If you have much property but a low income you should sell a portion of your items to have overall lower taxes. All things will be levied with those new taxes, from spoons to great estates spanning kilometers. This is an unpopular and very untraditional proposal but it gained support through the economically competent people in our realm. Maybe we should listen to them. Or we can just drop all the initiative and suffer the consequences of an inefficient tax policy. The Nobility would be pleased with that."
 rossiya.507.a: "Let's not rush to do this..."

If we don’t want to suffer the same public backlash against us, not to mention the risk of future enemies using it against our soldiers, we need to get rid of this horrible contraption! Luckily one of our statesmen has come up with an excellent conclusion. All major powers have been invited to a conference in Saint Petersburg and has presented a declaration which forbids the use of this kind of bullets.

 rossiya.904.d: "Your Majesty, the reports you requested on the failures of our navy during the Crimean war. In summary, the Black Sea Fleet lacked many of the modern steam-driven ships that the Allied powers had. The fleet consisted mostly of old sail-driven ships, not those driven by steam. Our failings also lie in the strategic decisions of the Admirals, your Majesty. They refused to attack the transport and supply ships, allowing the Allied forces to land in Crimea. Since the navy refused to attack, their land forces were well-supplied and constantly reinforcing. Our fleet stayed in the harbour of Sevastopol thinking that the mere presence of our ships will deter them. Unfortunately, it did not. The enemy laid siege to Sevastopol and the navy scuttled ships to block the harbour and reuse the cannons in defence of the city. After the scuttling, the navy lost all control of the Black Sea, we were unable to contest any landings nor sink their supply ships. Along with the report on the naval failings, we also brought ideas and various studies on the naval action of the war so that our navy knows how to prevent another repeat of the Crimean war if we ever have to fight another big naval power."

 ### IDEAS ###
 RUS_idea_russian_corruption1: "Russian Corruption"
 RUS_idea_russian_corruption1_desc: "In 1857, corruption is rampant in the Russian Empire, permeating every level of government and society. Bribery, nepotism, and embezzlement are widespread, with officials and bureaucrats often prioritizing personal gain over the public good. This corruption has serious consequences for the functioning of the government and the wellbeing of the population.\n\nAt the highest levels of government, corruption is particularly prevalent. Powerful nobles and bureaucrats use their influence and connections to secure lucrative positions and contracts, often at the expense of more deserving candidates. This leads to a system of patronage and cronyism, with positions and resources allocated based on personal connections rather than merit. As a result, many talented individuals are excluded from positions of power and influence, hindering the development of the country.\n\nCorruption also impacts the daily lives of ordinary Russians. Officials at all levels of government demand bribes for even basic services, such as obtaining permits or licenses. This creates a system of "red tape" and delays, with many people forced to pay bribes simply to navigate the bureaucracy. Corruption also contributes to economic inequality, as those with connections or wealth are often able to bypass the rules and regulations that hinder others."

 RUS_idea_inefficient_judicial_system: "Ineffective Judicial System"
 RUS_idea_inefficient_judicial_system_desc: "During the reign of Alexander II in 1857, the judicial system in the Russian Empire is characterized by widespread corruption, inefficiency, and lack of accountability. The system is divided into two separate entities: the criminal court and the civil court. However, both systems suffer from similar issues, including the influence of the state and nobility over the judiciary, as well as insufficient funding and resources.\n\nThe criminal court is particularly ineffective, with trials often being conducted in secret and verdicts based on limited evidence. The use of torture to extract confessions is widespread, and sentences are often severe, with capital punishment being the most common penalty. The civil court, on the other hand, is known for its slow and bureaucratic processes, often taking years to resolve even the simplest of cases. Moreover, the judicial system is inaccessible to the majority of the population, as legal representation is expensive and often not available outside of major cities.\n\nAs a result, the Russian Empire's judicial system fails to provide a fair and impartial justice system to its citizens, and instead perpetuates a system of injustice and oppression. The lack of accountability and transparency in the judiciary undermines the rule of law, and further contributes to the growing discontent and unrest among the population. The need for reform becomes increasingly urgent, as the people of Russia demand a more just and equitable system."

 RUS_idea_caucasuswar: "The Caucasian War"
 RUS_idea_caucasuswar_desc: "In 1857, the Russian Empire is embroiled in the Caucasian War, a long and bloody conflict against the various tribes of the Caucasus region. The war has been raging for several decades, with both sides engaging in brutal fighting and committing atrocities. The Russian Empire seeks to expand its territory and control over the region, while the various tribes resist this encroachment on their land and way of life.\n\nThe conflict is characterized by guerrilla warfare, with the tribes using hit-and-run tactics to harass Russian forces and disrupt their supply lines. The Russian Empire responds with overwhelming force, employing modern weaponry and large armies to crush the tribal resistance. Despite the use of force, the conflict remains protracted and brutal, with neither side gaining a decisive advantage. The war is also complicated by the involvement of various outside powers, such as Britain and Turkey, who seek to influence the outcome of the conflict.\n\nThe consequences of the Caucasian War are significant, both for the Russian Empire and the peoples of the Caucasus. The war has led to the annexation of large parts of the region, with the Russian Empire seeking to establish control over the area. However, the conflict has also led to the displacement and resettlement of many of the local tribes, with their way of life and cultural traditions severely impacted. The Caucasus region remains a hotbed of conflict and tension to this day, with the legacy of the Caucasian War continuing to shape the political and social landscape of the area."

 RUS_idea_tsarist_vodka_monopoly_desc: "Ever since Ivan IV enforced a state monopoly over the vodka industry, Russian Tsars have greatly profited from the sale of vodka – the monetary benefits of this monopoly were so great that sometimes the lower nobles were rewarded vodka production rights instead of land or any other legal privileges. Sadly, vodka itself has had a damaging effect on the Russian society, for it is a poison to the soul and body. Whereas the western societies are energetic and ambitious, our society is subdued by this sinful drink. Alcohol is deeply rooted in Russian culture and it'll take great effort to change this fact."

 RUS_idea_granary: "Granary Of Europe"
 RUS_idea_granary_desc: "During the reign of Alexander II in 1857, the Russian Empire is known as the "Granary of Europe" due to its vast agricultural output. The empire's fertile land, abundant natural resources, and large rural population allow for the production of large quantities of grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye, as well as other crops, such as potatoes and sugar beets. This agricultural output not only sustains the empire's own population, but also provides a vital source of food for the rest of Europe.\n\nThe development of large-scale farming techniques, including the use of mechanization and crop rotation, helps to increase the efficiency and productivity of Russian agriculture. The empire's vast railway network also allows for the rapid transportation of goods from rural areas to urban centers and ports, facilitating the export of grains and other agricultural products to other countries. The importance of Russian agriculture to the European economy is reflected in the empire's role as a major supplier of grains to countries such as Great Britain and Germany.\n\nHowever, the "Granary of Europe" title belies the deep-seated issues and inequalities within Russian agriculture. The majority of the rural population are poor peasants, who are subject to harsh working conditions and often struggle to make ends meet. Moreover, the land is largely owned by wealthy landlords, who often exploit their tenants and workers for their own gain. The agricultural system is also heavily reliant on serfdom, with many peasants being tied to the land and unable to leave their place of birth. Despite these challenges, Russian agriculture remains a vital component of the empire's economy and a major contributor to the European food supply."

 RUS_vic_Avoiding_Coalitions_desc: "During the reign of Alexander II in 1857, the Russian Empire employs a policy of avoiding alliances with other major powers in Europe. This policy is driven by the desire to maintain Russian sovereignty and to avoid being drawn into international conflicts. The empire's diplomatic efforts focus on maintaining friendly relations with neighboring countries, while avoiding any formal military alliances.\n\nRussia's position as a major power, with a large army and vast territory, means that the country is viewed with suspicion by other European powers. The fear of being encircled by a coalition of enemies, as happened during the Napoleonic Wars, leads the Russian leadership to take a cautious approach to international relations. Instead of seeking out allies, Russia prioritizes strengthening its own military and diplomatic capabilities, and promoting its interests through bilateral agreements and informal alliances.\n\nDespite this policy of avoiding formal coalitions, Russia is still involved in a number of international disputes, including conflicts over the Balkans and the Caucasus. The empire's efforts to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors are often undermined by these conflicts, as well as by the imperialist ambitions of other European powers. Nonetheless, the avoidance of formal alliances allows Russia to maintain a degree of independence and flexibility in its foreign policy, while also reducing the risk of being drawn into a wider conflict."

 RUS_vic_crimean_war_outcome: "Outcome of the Crimean War"
 RUS_vic_crimean_war_outcome_desc: "In 1853 we tried to exert our rightful role as protector of the Orthodox inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire, but the Ottomans betrayed their promise and forced our hand against them. We were assaulted by the greatest armies assembled since the time of Napoleon, and betrayed by our supposed allies, the Austrians. Our armies were damaged and humiliated, our treasury drained, and we even lost the right to possess a navy in the Black Sea, or to fortify our own lands that border that sea. These terms have shamed us since they were signed, but they have shown us that the current state is unsustainable. We must change our nation, our army, and our navy to be able to survive and compete against our enemies. If we fail to change, then the world around us will destroy us, just as it threatened to in the past."
 RUS_vic_milyutin_military_reforms: "Implement Milyutin's Military Reforms"
 RUS_vic_milyutin_military_reforms_desc: "The time has come to change our military, and Minister Milyutin has several ideas intended to fulfill our request. He has proposed several changes to our present organization. He wishes to remove our largest units during peacetime; the Army and Corps, and to use the division as the largest unit. He also has proposed that we divide the nation into a large number of districts, in order to better organize defense of the nation and planning in war time. Once these districts have been established, officers will be granted command, where they will be in charge of supervising the active duty soldiers, and commanding the reserves, as well as managing local military activities and institutions such as schools and fortresses."
 RUS_vic_horrors_crimean_war: "The Horrors of the Crimean War"
 RUS_vic_horrors_crimean_war_desc: "The Crimean War has forever changed war for the Russian people. We will never forget what happened to our soldiers, and how they came back changed. These soldiers carry the memory of the brutal battles they saw in Crimea with them each day. They are forever affected by trench madness, their wounds, the remnants of their disease, and even by the harshness of the winter itself. While the suffering of these veterans is to be honored, they must be the last to experience this, and in the future we will create a world where no soldier will need to suffer as much."
 RUS_vic_steam_armored_fleet: "Transition to Steam Armored Fleet"
 RUS_vic_steam_armored_fleet_desc: "Our fleet is aged, and yet it is still powerful and large. However, we cannot simply sit and appreciate the size and might of our Pacific Fleet or the Baltic Fleet. Instead, we must move forward, and adopt the modern advancements in steam power that grants speeds never before seen to ships. These advancements hold the potential to allow our navies to meet together far faster than would ever have been possible in the past, though such a maneuver being effective still seems like a far off dream today."
 RUS_vic_armored_steam_tactics: "Armored Steam Fleet Tactics"
 RUS_vic_armored_steam_tactics_desc: "Our fleet has been drastically improved from its previous state, and now even holds armored warships. And yet, we have not worked out our doctrines with such ships. We now have a great fleet, and yet we do not yet know how to use it. This must be quickly rectified, and we will organize our theorists and officers together in order to form a method that is both effective and within our means."
 RUS_vic_russian_s_n_co: "Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company"
 RUS_vic_russian_s_n_co_desc: "Having adopted steam power in our navy, we should formalize its use in our trade. Their effectiveness in such scenarios is clear, and their adoption on a greater scale could offer us immense benefits. To attain these we will form the Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company in Odessa, and begin routes to Constantinople and Smyrna."
 RUS_vic_prestige_russian_navy: "Prestige of the Russian Navy"
 RUS_vic_prestige_russian_navy_desc: "The Russian Navy has existed for centuries, truly beginning with Peter the Great, and its history has been illustrious. Although perhaps not as dominant as the British or French, few would dare to doubt our might. Our victories range from Navarino to Sinop, and although our navy may have been defeated in the Crimean War, our pedigree still stands."
 RUS_vic_baltic_excellence: "Baltic Excellence"
 RUS_vic_baltic_excellence_desc: "Though the British have been making inroads into the Baltic and attempting to gain partial control, the Baltic has long been a Russian sea. Having defeated the Swedish, our navy has the longest experience in fighting in that sea, and the longest list of victories over our competitors."
 RUS_vic_reconstruction_flotilia: "Reconstruction of the Russian Flotilia"
 RUS_vic_reconstruction_flotilia_desc: "Much of our fleet was crushed in the Crimean War, and its size has not fully recovered. What remains is often out of date, but this is not completely negative. This can present the perfect opportunity to construct a new, far improved, flotilla without the problems other names would face with justifying constructing new ships."
 RUS_vic_petropavlovsk_class: "Petropavlovsk Class Ships"
 RUS_vic_petropavlovsk_class_desc: "Our nation has seen the might of the Ironclad in the navies of others, and we wish to have such power for ourselves. Although the Petropavlovsk has already been ordered, we could have it refitted as an Ironclad, reducing the cost and potentially granting us a ship that will fill the role we originally desired it for, and the role of Ironclad at the same time. If this ship is as we hope, then we could order even more and have a respectable fleet of Ironclads."
 RUS_vic_marine_technical_committee: "Marine Technical Committee"
 RUS_vic_marine_technical_committee_desc: "We will organize a committee of experts in order to develop our shipbuilding program. Their task will be to decide what ships we should construct in order to meet our goals, where, and using what methods. Their activities should significantly ease the burden of planning, and possibly make the very construction of our ships easier."
 RUS_vic_nevskiy_factory: "Nevskiy Factory"
 RUS_vic_nevskiy_factory_desc: "Let us found a new shipbuilding plant to supplement our ability to construct new ships. Our demand has grown greater, and our current capabilities will be insufficient. To make up for this deficiency we will create a brand new facility in Saint Petersburg, with the most modern shipbuilding technologies we currently possess. The wonders that will come out of this shipyard will be the pride of our navy, and all will see the great fleet we produce."
 RUS_vic_armored_cruiser_general_admiral: "The First Armored Cruiser \"General-Admiral\""
 RUS_vic_armored_cruiser_general_admiral_desc: "Having seen the development of armored ships in other nations, we have created a new wonder of our own: General-Admiral. It is the first of her kind and scale, and is one of the greatest warships that can be found on the sea. While she may be surpassed eventually, we will make more of her class, and the honor of creating the first of this type will always be Russia's."
 RUS_vic_only_russian_iron: "Utilization of Only Russian Iron"
 RUS_vic_only_russian_iron_desc: "With improvements in mining constantly developing, our production of iron has grown immensely. However, we often still rely on foreign iron for the construction of our ships. We will cease this practice in order to benefit our economy and enable our navy to grow at our discretion, rather than at the rate other nations will allow it to."
 RUS_vic_monitor_construcion_program: "\"Program for the Construction of Monitors\""
 RUS_vic_monitor_construcion_program_desc: "Our coast is in many areas under threat, and we cannot allow this to stand. Whether or not they have recently been under attack is irrelevant, as the threat is ever present, and the utility of naval bombardment was adequately demonstrated in the Crimean War. We will create a line of Coastal Monitor ships to prevent such things from occuring again, with these ships being charged with the defense of our coasts and bombardment of our enemies."
 RUS_vic_first_battleship: "The First Naval Battleship"
 RUS_vic_first_battleship_desc: "The rate of improvement in naval technology is truly astonishing, and new wonders become possible each day. One of the greatest is the creation of the Battleship, a fully armored ship of immense size and power that is still faster than many ships that came before it. If we truly wish to have a navy which can compete with our rivals, we must construct such a ship of our own before we are completely outmatched."
 RUS_vic_far_eastern_navy: "Beginning of a Far Eastern Navy"
 RUS_vic_far_eastern_navy_desc: "For too long has the east been neglected. Although our nation has previously lacked the interest or ability to exploit the full worth of our eastern coast, this is no longer the case. We will immediately begin taking steps towards creating a force capable of dominating the area, beginning with the reorganization of our current forces, expansion of our bases, and the construction of new ships. Once  we have completed these goals, the wealth lanes of the east will be ours for the taking."
 RUS_vic_siberian_flotilia: "The Siberian Military Flotilia"
 RUS_vic_siberian_flotilia_desc: "Currently our greatest fleet in our eastern provinces is the Okhotsk Flotilla. To signify our renewed focus on these lands we will rename it to the Siberian Military Flotilla, and begin its expansion into a fleet that can threaten our foes and protect our seas far better than would previously have been possible."
 RUS_vic_eastern_bases: "Military Bases in the East"
 RUS_vic_eastern_bases_desc: "Our western naval bases are often our primary focus, as they serve our largest fleets and protect our most important trade routes. However, the wealth of our eastern lands is growing, and if we improved our bases a great fleet could be built in the east. This could grant us control of the trade in these wealthy seas."
 RUS_vic_force_sea_of_japan: "A Force in the Sea of Japan"
 RUS_vic_force_sea_of_japan_desc: "No other European power holds the number of ports in the Sea of Japan as we do, and our direct land connection truly solidifies this position. We must exploit this position, and found our own force of ships to wrest control of this area. These seas are wealthy, and such control could be highly lucrative if we can maintain it."
 RUS_vic_shipbuilding_program_1876: "The Shipbuilding Program of 1876"
 RUS_vic_shipbuilding_program_1876_desc: "Having organized factories and reformed our naval operations, it is time to begin a new batch of ship constructions. Our navy must grow or else it will be surpassed, and yet we must also ensure that the ships that we construct are of a good quality, and able to compete in ability rather than just numbers. Our factories should be to produce enough ships to fill our needs, and if need be the option to purchase ships is always available."
 RUS_vic_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 RUS_vic_naval_academy_desc: "Although we possess the Advanced Officer's Class, Russia has no Naval Academy. Despite this, the existence of the Advanced Officer's Class makes this issue very easy to resolve. We will create a formal Naval Academy on a new scale by using the experienced teachers of the Advanced Officer's Class as the foundation, and begin a new endeavor to teach a great new generation of formally trained officers."

 RUS_vic_dissolve_cantonists: "Dissolve Cantonists"
 RUS_vic_dissolve_cantonists_desc: "Since 1721 we have made use of the Cantonists, the young sons of our conscripts who received an education in the same career as their fathers. However, the lack of results from these long efforts, and the public condemnation the practice has received have now forced our hand. We can no longer justify this practice, and we will simply dissolve the system, allowing the young boys to return home and decide their own path in life."
 RUS_vic_abolish_inhumane_punishment: "Abolish Inhumane Punishment"
 RUS_vic_abolish_inhumane_punishment_desc: "With the Cantonists dissolved, perhaps it is the time to remove other immoral aspects from our military. We will begin with the punishments we inflict on our soldiers. While across Europe most nations have abandoned punishments such as branding, whipping, we have continued with such practices, and even have our own such as the infamous gauntlet. However, experience and the belief of our theorists have pushed us away from such traditions, and we will formally abolish those practices once and for all."
 RUS_vic_visit_prussian_military_staff: "Visit to the Prussian Military Staff"
 RUS_vic_visit_prussian_military_staff_desc: "The Prussian Staff is truly extraordinary, pioneering new ways of thinking about war, and we have much to learn from them. We have long had contact with the military of Prussia, though not always on the same side, but their ability cannot be doubted. In recognition of this and their current fame, we will send our officers to visit the Prussian Staff and see what can be learned, and possibly plan out further cooperation."
 RUS_vic_military_justice_reform: "Military-Justice Reform"
 RUS_vic_military_justice_reform_desc: "Having begun reforms on our punishments, we should also begin to reform our system of Military Justice. We must reconsider what our soldiers can and should be punished for, and how best to maintain discipline and morale at their best states. We should look to our neighbors and allies to learn of their methods, and see what can be learned from their experience with military justice."
 RUS_vic_change_uniforms: "A Change in the Uniforms"
 RUS_vic_change_uniforms_desc: "For too long have we held onto our outdated uniforms, while our competitors have moved towards more effective or less expensive uniforms. We will begin phasing out our older uniforms and creating new types with less cost and greater utility."
 RUS_vic_alexander_military_law_academy: "The Alexander Military Law Academy"
 RUS_vic_alexander_military_law_academy_desc: "In order to ensure that justice is truly delivered, we will form a new academy to educate our officers in justice. It will create a large group of officers capable of filling judicial roles in our military in a far more professional and formalized manner than was previously possible. These officers will be our instruments for justice, and should bring it to our armies."
 RUS_vic_women_medical_courses: "Medical Courses for Women"
 RUS_vic_women_medical_courses_desc: "Our military has rarely held any roles for women, and even fewer in an official way, and yet this is now changing. We have found that employing women in non-combat roles, particularly medical roles, can benefit our military. Such roles have been known for many years, but became most pronounced during the Crimean War. We will formally institute education to enable these roles permanently, hopefully saving many of our soldiers' lives."
 RUS_vic_conscription_1874: "Conscription Statue of [GetYear]"
 RUS_vic_conscription_1874_desc: "Our previous laws of conscription were both too harsh, and too riddled with exemptions. We will promulgate a new statute on universal military duty, and establish six-year terms for service, service across all levels of society, and a clear and simple system of exemptions. These changes are intended to create a more effective system for conscription, as well as to ease the burden and unrest caused by our previous systems."
 RUS_vic_destroy_native_guard_corps: "Destroy the Native Guard Corps"
 RUS_vic_destroy_native_guard_corps_desc: "The Life Guard have proven unreliable and ineffective several times in their history, and their presence will no longer be tolerated. We will break up the corps, dispersing its units into other formations, or simply discharging them into civilian life. With their influence broken we will find that the Tsar's power has grown, while that of the nobility has weakened."
 RUS_vic_keep_nobility_in_army: "Keep the Nobility in the Army"
 RUS_vic_keep_nobility_in_army_desc: "Our nobility is the backbone of our army, and disrupting this status quo would only bring instability and inefficiency into our forces. Perhaps there are many competent officers in the common folk, but the disruption and instability their induction would bring is simply not worth the risk."
 RUS_vic_allow_non_noble_officers: "Allow Non-Noble Officers in the Army"
 RUS_vic_allow_non_noble_officers_desc: "The nobility has for too long monopolized our officer corps. We have denied too many competent officers on the basis of their birth. This will all change now. We will end the monopoly of the nobility on the officer corps, and allow competent officers of low birth to join their ranks. We hope this will improve the ability of our officers on the whole."
 RUS_vic_rules_of_war: "The Rules of War"
 RUS_vic_rules_of_war_desc: "War has changed, and the barbarity of the past has become unacceptable to many. Although war is often too messy for such rules to be faithfully followed at all times, constructing a code of conduct for warfare will keep our soldiers in check, and please our own people with their conduct and impress our neighbors and rivals. Let's just hope that our troops are willing to follow them."

 RUS_vic_european_army: "European Model Army"
 RUS_vic_european_army_desc: "Russia's military history is long and illustrious, with truly great generals and victories arising from our nation. However, it has had its own issues, and allowing these issues to fester will only destroy our army rather than nurture it. As such, we will reform our army to create one of such power and prestige that all of Europe will admire it, and the defeats of the past will be overwritten by the glories of tomorrow."
 RUS_vic_rusian_military_districts: "Russia's Military Districts"
 RUS_vic_rusian_military_districts_desc: "At the advice of Milyutin, we will divide Russia into 15 military districts, which our regional defense and local troops will be organized around. These new formations are intended to enhance the control our troops are able to exert on rebellious areas, as well as create the most militarily useful divisions of land rather than focus on more political issues."

 RUS_vic_regulations_military_districts: "Regulations on the Military Districts"
 RUS_vic_regulations_military_districts_desc: "Our war ministry has grown to great size, and occupies much of our military budget. Cutting these costs could allow us to reallocate such funds to more pressing issues such as the rearmament of our troops, expansion of units, and a huge number of other possibilities. These wasted funds create a burden, and reducing the size of the ministry could quickly and easily alleviate that, while empowering our army as a whole."
 RUS_vic_fortification_of_empire: "Fortification of the Empire"
 RUS_vic_fortification_of_empire_desc: "Our great nation is of nearly unrivaled size across the world, but controlling such lands has been a challenge we have wrestled for centuries. One consistent solution has been the construction of fortifications, and it has served us well many times. We will begin construction of new fortifications in a variety of areas, intending to maintain and strengthen our control of areas under threat and our most valuable lands."
 RUS_vic_obukhovsky_plant: "Obukhovsky Plant"
 RUS_vic_obukhovsky_plant_desc: "We have gained permission from the German company Krupp to produce artillery based on their designs, and we will construct a new factory to accomplish this. Headed by Pavel Obukhov, we will begin producing chiefly naval artillery, but once the factory has been founded a variety of guns will be able to be produced from it, and new developments will be produced. These guns will support our troops and pave a new path for our nation."
 RUS_vic_new_rifle_models: "New Rifle Models"
 RUS_vic_new_rifle_models_desc: "Our rifles are no longer powerful enough nor fast enough to be truly competitive against our rivals, and we must replace our current weapons. We will test a variety of weapons, from experts across Europe and even America. Our officers will have the final say, but these reforms are fundamentally necessary to maintain our place."
 RUS_vic_cavalry_regulation: "Regulation of Cavalry Combat Service"
 RUS_vic_cavalry_regulation_desc: "Although highly important, the discipline of our cavalry has at times been questionable. We no longer find this to be acceptable, and will immediately begin taking steps to permanently correct it. We will implement regulations that closely control the activities of our cavalry, and ensure their proper behavior. These regulations will also be intended to improve the ability of our cavalry, and ensure their maximum effectiveness on the battlefield."
 RUS_vic_cossack_reforms: "Development of the Cossack Reforms"
 RUS_vic_cossack_reforms_desc: "We will formally institute regulations and reforms regarding our Cossack troops, and formally categorize our Cossack population as a military estate. These regulations will ensure our Cossacks are able to properly act in concert with our other military units, and ensure that they are properly disciplined. Our cossacks have served us well in the past, and with these new reforms, they will continue to do so for many years in the future."
 RUS_vic_1873_defence_plan: "1873 Defence Plan"
 RUS_vic_1873_defence_plan_desc: "In order to ensure that Russia will be properly defended in case of invasion, we will create a formal plan to organize our response in case we are invaded. These plans will be intended to specify troop movements, organize garrisons, among other things. In total, these will allow our troops to quickly respond at rates that would otherwise be impossible, rather than scrambling to create ideas while the enemy marches in."
 RUS_vic_first_railway_commands: "Creation of the First Railway Commands"
 RUS_vic_first_railway_commands_desc: "Railways have begun to be constructed in our nation, and their utility for the military has become immediately clear. To facilitate their use in our military we will form railway commands, organizing how and where our troops will be transported. This will allow our troops to travel across our massive nation at rates that would previously have been impossible. This could even grant us greater control of our furthest lands and the ability to respond to threats at previously impossible speeds."
 RUS_vic_iron_wagons: "Switch to Iron Wagons"
 RUS_vic_iron_wagons_desc: "With our railway commands formed, we will begin to armor and upgrade our railcars. These upgrades are intended to ensure the safety of our troops and any materiel we transport on those trains. Although their speed will be impaired by the weight of such iron cars, the additional security offered is worth it."
 RUS_vic_ballon_commission: "The Ballon Commission"
 RUS_vic_ballon_commission_desc: "Other nations have been experimenting with military implementations of hot-air balloons, and we will follow their example. We will form a commission intended to ascertain the effectiveness and cost of balloons, and find if their use will benefit our nation. Whether or not we decide to implement such technologies, simply observing their uses could benefit us immensely."
 RUS_vic_mayevski_artillery: "Mayevski's Artillery"
 RUS_vic_mayevski_artillery_desc: "Nikolai Mayevski is a true visionary. His ideas on ballistics, rifled cannons, and external ballistics are some of the greatest of our age. We will implement these grand ideas with his advice, and create weapons that few can rival. Our artillery will have guns of such range and power that they will shake the earth, and it will all be thanks to the great mind of Mayevski."

 RUS_decision_category_milyutin_reforms: "Dmitry Milyutin's Army Reform"
 RUS_decision_category_milyutin_reforms_desc: "Our defeat in the Crimean war was brought to us because of our disorganized and obsolete military, which was pretty much the same as 50 years before - in the times of Napoleon! No one doubts that we defeated him, but more than 40 years of stagnation aren't healthy for anything. This mustn't last any longer, and that's why our new Minister of War, Dmitry Milytin, made an extensive report, which declared new goals for the Russian military: reorganize the army structure, make it smaller at expense of the non-combat units, make mobilization go faster and units get to their combat state quicker, make army less bulky in times of peace, create the system of military districts, arrange rearmament, make soldiers more literate and so on. Some reforms can be fired at the same time, but consequences will be more harsh then usual ones and will last longer."

 RUS_decision_mayevskys_artillery: "Mayevsky's Artillery Model"
 RUS_decision_mayevskys_artillery_desc: "Our cannons are still produced by the standards of the beginning of the century, while there were many innovations secured by the Western powers. One of those would be rifled guns with new construction, still loading from the front but having more accuracy and firing range, proposed by N.V. Mayevsky."
 RUS_decision_baranovskys_artillery: "Baranovsky's Artillery Model"
 RUS_decision_baranovskys_artillery_desc: "Despite having pretty good rifled cannons of Mayevsky construction, we still need the newer ones, as advancements in artillery technologies go even hastier than before. That's why V.S. Baranovsky made a new cannon... and it's surprisingly good! Every foreign spy is trying to get to know how we managed to do it, but this gun caused a new wave of innovations just by appearing!"
 RUS_decision_new_military_districts: "New Military Districts"
 RUS_decision_new_military_districts_desc: "Our army is too vast and hierarchial to manage it in the times of peace, so Milyutin proposed a new system of organization - military districts will take place of the armies, while armies and army corps are no longer present without war. This will help us to get rid of excessive administrative expenses on the upkeep of those thousands of officers."
 RUS_decision_medical_corps: "Medical Corps"
 RUS_decision_medical_corps_desc: "Medical Corps is a new institution in Russian Imperial Army, which aims to make soldiers more healthy and lower the rate of non-combat losses. It isn't too efficient, because our doctors still aren't that educated as they should be, but at least we are trying to ease the life of our soldiers in their camps and make more wounded come back to arms and less cripples come to their homes."

First use of them was documented during the American Civil War, while it also proved very useful against native peoples all around the world. We should adopt this new type of armament and make use of it!"
 RUS_decision_austro_italo_french_war: "Send Observers to the Belligerent Armies"
 RUS_decision_austro_italo_french_war_desc: "Despite our neutral cause in the recently broken Austro-Italo-French war, we want France to consider us friendly, that's why we stationed some of our troops on the border of the traitorous Austria, to help the French in their war. Also we sent military observers, in other words - legal spies - to the warring states, overlooking Austrian, Sardinian and French armies, extorting new experience from that and finding out, how real army is organized, to prepare our army for the reforms."

 ### Heads of State
 RUS_Alexander_II: "Alexander II"
 RUS_Alexander_III: "Alexander III"

 ### Russian Leaders
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_II_DESC: "Born in the great city of Moscow, 1818, Alexander II  (born Alexander Nikolayevich) was the eldest son and heir of Tzar Nicholas I and his spouse, Princess Charlotte of Prussia. His parent's marriage, despite being formed purely for political purposes amongst the Russian and Prussian royalty, was a prosperous one. From birth, Alexander was given the title of Tsesarevich, which has been traditionally given to the heirs of the Russian throne.\n\n The upbringing and early education of Alexander seemed inconducive to creating a great reformer. Indeed, the opposite, as currently seen throughout Russia, was true. At the time of his upbringing, the court and political atmosphere was intensely conservative under his father's authoritarian rule. Dissent from any corner, regardless of rank, was severely punishable. Even Alexander, who was dearest to his family and all of Russia, was cautious around his belligerent father.\n\n Alexander's father was nothing if not practical in the upbringing of his successor. Nicholas had an uneventful upbringing as merely a second to the throne. He was determined to not let Alexander suffer the same fate and provided him with tutors, such as the great reformer Mikhail Speransky and romantic poet Vasily Zhukovsky, as well as military advisor General Karl Merder. This combination led to Alexander being well-prepared and more liberal than his father. \n\n While traversing Western Europe in 1839, Alexander was in search of a royal wife. After a stop in Baden where his parents were advocates for the marriage of the princess, but the Tsesarevich showed no interest, an unexpected stop in Hesse proved well as he would find love in Duke Ludwig IIs Daughter, Marie. Despite some early objections from his mother and a long engagement because of Marie's youth, Alexander and Marie married on April 28, 1841. Their first child, the Grand Duchess Alexandra, was born in August 1842 but died of meningitis at a young age. In September 1843, Nicholas was born and was deemed heir, then followed in 1845 by Alexander, Vladimir in 1847, and Alexei in 1850. \n\n Alexander has shed some light on the crippled and corrupted state of Russia after the fallout of the Crimean War some years ago. Still ongoing, the Tsar has been pushing for liberation of Serfdom across the state, with many more reforms expected."

 pr_total_desc: "In 1857, Czar Alexander II is implementing a series of reforms aimed at modernizing and liberalizing the Russian Empire. These reforms include the emancipation of serfs, the establishment of local self-government, the creation of an independent judiciary, and the expansion of educational opportunities.\nThe Emancipation Reform, which was enacted in 1861, frees the serfs from their landlords and allows them to own land and marry without their lord's permission. This move aims to abolish the feudal-like system that has been in place for centuries, which was stifling Russia's economic and social progress.\nIn addition to the Emancipation Reform, Alexander II establishes elected assemblies in rural areas and cities, giving the people more say in local government. He also creates an independent judiciary to ensure justice and fairness for all, regardless of social status.\nFurthermore, the Czar expands educational opportunities, particularly for women, by creating more schools and universities. The goal is to provide a more skilled and educated workforce, which will help modernize the economy and society.\nOverall, Alexander II's reforms aim to modernize and liberalize the Russian Empire, paving the way for future progress and development."
