 #Political Stability
 INGAME_WIKI_TEXT_INDEX_0: "§YPolitical Stability§! is a key mechanic in §YEnd of a New Beginning§! which shows how §Gstable§! the current government of a country is.\n\nPolitical Stability reaches from §R-5§! to §G+3§!. With each level gained or lost, a country either receives §Rdebuffs§! or §Gbonuses§! in certain areas. The default value of §Y0§! has no effects at all. In order to see what effects your current Political Stability has on you, hover over the £pol_stab_1 icon in the topbar. Every time Political Stability rises or sinks, the player receives events informing them about it.\n\nPolitical Stability §Rsinks§! with every politically questionable, aggressive or generally unstable action, like declaring war, losing a war, leaving a faction, losing a border war, ending a civil war and other. If the Political Stability reaches §R-3§! a radical ideology within the country will start gaining traction. If the Political Stability continues to sink and reaches §R-5§! the country will either experience a civil war or political takeover.\n\n§GEvery year§! the player will receive an event talking about an upcoming speech, to be held by the leader of the player's country. These events almost always have multiple options attached to them, which in turn can either lower or increase the current Political Stability. Which option to choose depends on what §Gideology§! the player's government has.\n\nThe options attached to the yearly event can always be categorized into either being §Raggressive§!, §Gcareful§! or §gneutral§!.\n\nIdeologies considered to be §Raggressive§!:\n - Traditional Conservatism\n - Vanguard Communism\n - Anarchism\n - Autocracy\n - Chauvinist Populism\n\nIdeologies considered to be §Gcareful§!:\n - Centrism\n - Fundamentalism\n\nIdeologies considered to be §gneutral§!:\n - Social Egalitarian\n - Radical Socialism\n - Radical Democracy\n\nApart from the yearly event, Political Stability is increased by §YFocus Trees§!, §Yevents§! or by each successful vote in the §GParliament§!."

 #Colonisation
 INGAME_WIKI_TEXT_INDEX_2: "The §YColonisation§! mechanic is what §YGreat§! and §YSecondary Powers§! use to colonise africa during the §YScramble for Africa§!.\n\nThere are three phases.\n\n§gScramble for Africa§!:\nEach state has a colonisation level, in order to begin colonisation in a state you need to invest £colonial_power (§YColonial Power§!). The cost is either 80£colonial_power for a unclaimed state or 40£colonial_power for a claimed(or cored) state. Each level of colonisation then requires spending both §YLegislative Power§!£pol_power  and §YCommand Power§!£command_power . State Colonisation progress through levels and once you have reached lv4 in a uncontested state you gain control over it and are refunded £colonial_power .\nA contested state is a colonial state that is either occupied by a historical resisitor, or another colonial power is at least 2 colonisation levels behind you. In order to colonise a contested state you need to complete the final colonisation level before any other colonial power can, if another colonial power is at lv6 when a state is colonised in this way they get the option to contest the state causing a colonial crisis.\n\nThe §gColonial Conference§!:\n A §YColonial Conference§! will begin either after a colonial crisis happens or if the date is after 1883 and §YGermany§!, §YPortugal§! and §YBritain§! exist. \nThis conference (historically called the "Berlin" Conference) wil invite all §YGreat§! and §YSecondary powers§! in the world to attend, once the attendants arrive a series of votes will start.\nThe first vote will be on the subject of slavery in africa, the proceeding votes will continue in rounds over each colonial region in africa.\nIn your §YDecisions menu§! you will get a selection of colonial powers to pick from in order to chose the controller of the currently selected colonial region, each state owned by a country or that countries puppets within the colonial region will grant a extra vote.\nOnce every Attendant has voted the winner will receive Cores on that colonial region.\nAfter the controller of each §YColonial Region§! in africa has been decided on, the host of the conference will receive prestige and §YColonial Charters§! will be unlocked.\n\n§gColonial Charters§!:\n§YColonial Charters§! are desisions that allow you to completly annex the region you have been assigned in the §YColonial Conference§!, this will take some time and once completed will grant you control of all tribal countries(except resistor capitals)within that region, you then will be declared war on by any tribal resisitors within that region.\n\n§YColonial Power§!£colonial_power is based on the amount of factories you have multipled by 8, plus any colonial tech you have."

 #Military High Command
 INGAME_WIKI_TEXT_INDEX_4: "The §YMHC system§! allows the player or AI to oversee and manage the §Yhigh-ranking officers§! in their country, replacing the vanilla military advisors in the process.\n\nThe system is split into three organizations: the §GArmy§!, §GNavy§! and §GAirforce§!. Each organization houses unique positions. Each organization and position have a §Ypower level§!, determining how much \"§Ypower§!\" said entity holds in the country.\n\nThe task at hand is to balance the power between positions and organizations. The power level of organizations is partly dependent on the §Rinternal setup§! of the positions. The internal state/setup can become §Rdisorganized§!, leading to a monthly power loss of the affected organization and a §Rmassive debuff§! in the form of a dynamic modifier, should the §Yvertical up-stream of power§! be disrupted.\n\nGenerally, power (indicated by yellow arrows) should always flow from the lower to the higher positions. The more such disruptions between positions, the heavier the debuff becomes.\n\nA position, in case an advisor has been assigned to it, can be either §Yactive§! or §Yinactive§!. The label of an active position is colored §Yyellow§!. If a position is active, it will gain §Yone power level a month§! and §Ylose one power level a month§! if it is inactive. Inactive advisors do not give any buffs. In order to receive the modifiers of the advisor, the position the advisor is in has to be first §Gactivated§!. This can be done by clicking on the \"§YActive Positions§!\" button under the positions-window. Advisors can also be retired back into the selectable pool, vacating the position in the process, by pressing the §Rround red button with a red cross§! in the upper right corner of the position's frame. Note that these buttons are hidden by default and can be displayed by pressing the toggle-button next to the \"§YActive Positions§!\" button.\n\n§gMilitary Juntas:§!\n§YMilitary juntas§! can take temporary control of the country if an organizations' power has been allowed to §Rrise without oversight§!. Should the power level reach §Y80§!, a military junta has a §Y50%§! chance to spawn in each month going forward. A military junta should generally be regarded as something to avoid, considering the massive §RLegislative Power debuffs§! and political chaos they bring. A military junta will always §Rtry to change the country's laws§! in \"a military authoritarian fashion\". These law changes are pushed through by the junta by force, meaning if a vote in the parliament has been initiated then it will succeed no matter what. The player/AI has no further control over the voting procedure.\n\nJuntas do, however, provide §Ytemporary buffs§! in certain military areas. A military junta initiated by the §GArmy§!, for example, will provide a minor buff to the army (ground forces) and major training time buff. After the junta has concluded, an §Yafter-effects idea/spirit§! is added to the country for §Y180 days§!, during which no other junta can arise. Additionally, military juntas will §Rnullify both positive and negative Political Stability§!. Military juntas can not dynamically spawn in chauvinist populist countries.\n\nThere is a §Y12.5%§! chance other organizations will §Ywarn the player of the incoming junta§!, provided a single organization either has a power level of at least §Y50§! or the remaining two §Yboth at least 35§!. This makes it possible to avoid a military junta, even though the after effects idea is still applied for 60 days. A single organization will gain §Y20§! and two organizations will gain §Y10 power levels each§! if their offer is taken."
 #Coggs empire mechanic
 INGAME_WIKI_TEXT_INDEX_5: "§B(§!§gWhat is Empire Politics?§!§B)§!\nEmpire Politics is a mechanic that allows the player to fully engage with politics on all levels.\n\n§B(§!§gDo I have to engage with the Text RPG elements?§!§B)§!\nIn short, no. A player can utilize the 'Macro Management' decisions which will bypass the need to use state management menus. Though it's best to explore these menus as luxary goods, state coring, and martial law do not have 'Macro Management' decisions at this time.\n\n\n§B(§!§gState Autonomy§!§B)§!\nThis measures how autonomous a state is within our empire, at 100% autonomy the state will ask to be a subject. Having an autonomy of under 50% will remove any negative resource or recruitment modifiers.\n\n§B(§!§gEmpire Rule: Decentralized§!§B)§!\nDecentralized empire rule means the country has limited rulership over a particular state. States with decentralized empire rule will have a minimum autonomy cap of 75%. Thus, any effort to reduce the autonomy of a decentralized state below 75% is impossible, until Decentralized Empire Rule is removed from that state.\n\n§B(§!§gMartial Law§!§B)§!\nIf state autonomy becomes critically high in autonomy, you can enable 'martial law' in that state. Though enabling martial law will cause the public opinion of that state to decrease, use when absolutely needed.\n\n\n§B(§!§gState Loyalty§!§B)§!\nThis measures how loyal a state is to our empire. If a state's loyalty drops below zero, they will revolt against us. States will provide our empire with better recruitment for non-core and cored states if their loyalty is high. Additionally compliance and resistance modifiers will be positive if loyalty is high and negative if loyalty is low.\n\n§B(§!§gState Coring§!§B)§!\nWhen loyalty has reached 10 on a non-core state, it has the option to become a core through maintaining at least level 9 loyalty for 360 days.\n\n\n§B(§!§gPublic Opinion§!§B)§!\nPublic Opinion, depending on what it is, changes the respective state's loyalty on a monthly tick. Public Opinion can be modified by tax laws, events, economic states, state management choices, and more. Any modifier to public opinion will be indicated.\n\nElated Opinion will §Gincrease§! Loyalty by 1\nHappy Opinion will §Gincrease§! Loyalty by 0.5\nContent Opinion does not change Loyalty\nDiscontent Opinion will §Rdecrease§! Loyalty by 0.5\nUnhappy Opinion will §Rdecrease§! Loyalty by 1\n\n\n§B(§!§gEconomic Status§!§B)§!\nDifferent economic effects will impact resources, population, loyalty, and prosperity of a state. These are temporary and go away overtime.\n\n§B(§!§gLuxary Goods§!§B)§!\nLuxary goods are special deposits that can produce prosperity when upgraded. Not all states have luxary good deposits."

 #Crisis
 INGAME_WIKI_TEXT_INDEX_7: "§SNational Crises§! is a key §YEnd of a New Beginning§! mechanic that becomes relevant when your nation befalls to economic or political instability. Factional turmoil, civilian radicalization and more may occur, disrupting your nation's stability until the crisis has been resolved.\n \n§CFragmention§! tracks the level of instability caused by §H[EOANBSYS_national_crisis_name_scripted]§! and will continue to increase §S[EOANBSYS_national_crisis_time_scripted]§! without any intervention. Completing objectives, events and other actions related to the crisis may increase or decrease your fragmentation.\n \nReaching §R100 Fragmentation§! will bring greater disaster.\n \nReaching §G0 Fragmentation§! will end the crisis and avoid disastrous effects.\n"
 #Pandemics
 INGAME_WIKI_TEXT_INDEX_8: "§SPathogen Outbreaks§! are a key §YEnd of a New Beginning§! mechanic that simulates when a disease rapidly infect a given population, causing civil disruption, societal disorder and often times death. There are many types and levels of these outbreaks, each with substantially different effects.\n \n§SPathogens§! come in three varieties, §SBacterial§!, §SViral§!, and §SParasytic§!. §SBacterials§! may be more §Ctransmittable§!, but are often less §Cinfective§! to your populace. In comparison, §SParasytics§! do not transmute well, but could become lethal. Outbreaks come in two levels, §SEpidemic§! and §SPandemic§!. §SEpidemics§! are outbreaks that are mostly contained to a select countries/regions and will not spread. §SPandemics§! will spread from country to country, and may become a worldwide problem given sufficient global connectivity.\n \n§CTransmission§! tracks a pathogen's ability to spread through a population. §CInfectivity§! tracks a pathogen's lethality. Various technologies, policies and events may effect these rates.\n \n§CImmunitization§! tracks your nation's progress to ending the §SOutbreak§! and will continue to increase naturally §SBi-Weekly§! until the outbreak has been resolved. Completing objectives, events and other actions related to the outbreak may increase or decrease your population's Immunization.\n"
