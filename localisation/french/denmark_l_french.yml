#STARTING EVENTS
denmark.11.t: "Foreign Relations of the Kingdom of Denmark"
denmark.11.d: "Denmark has a long and complicated history of foreign relations. The country's geography and central position in Northern Europe meant that most trade in that part of the world has to pass through Danish territorial waters, making it almost impossible for any country north of the Alps not to maintain at least decent relations with Denmark. But its status as a secondary power, as well as the Danish heritage as a trading and seafaring nation also brought Danish expansion across the globe during the Early Modern period, the ramifications of which can still be felt today. Denmark has a capable corps of diplomats and they are eager to prove their value and the significance of Denmark on the global stage."
denmark.11.a: "Time to prove ourselves in the diplomatic arena."

#GENERAL INFO AND FLAVOUR EVENTS
denmark.16.t: "The Danish Population Boom"
denmark.16.d: "Denmark's population is rapidly growing due to high fertility rates, improved public hygiene, and advancements in medicine."
denmark.16.a: "Keep it up!"

###POLITICAL AND WAR EVENTS
#DOMESTIC POLITICS
denmark.201.t: "Statsminister Carl Christoffer Georg Andræ Retires"
denmark.201.d: "[DEN.GetLeader] has announced his retirement. The national liberals have a suitable candidate in waiting to take over, Carl Christian Hall. Hall seems to be the a stern supporter of a new constitution for the Helstat, binding Schleswig closer to Denmark. This would most certainly conflict with the interests of the German-speaking subjects of Denmark, and it will be interesting to see how the fairly young minister will try to realize his vision."
denmark.201.a: "Good luck then."
denmark.202.t: "The Eider Policy"
denmark.202.d: "The Eider policy is the idea of the closer integration of the Duchy of Schleswig into Denmark proper. The Schleswig-Holstein question has been looming over Denmark and the states of the German Confederation for decades now, and it even escalated into a military conflict amidst the German revolutions of 1848/49. The nationalist tensions that have been developing in both Denmark and Germany since the early 19th century have created the problem of ethnic affiliation to either Germany or Denmark for the largely multi-ethnic and intertwined communities of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nFollowing the war over the German duchies, which dragged on until 1851, the Great Powers gathered in London to put an end to the conflict with the so-called London Protocol, which stipulates that the Duchy of Schleswig, a Danish fief, and the Duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg, German fiefs, have to remain under a personal union with the Danish king, who's succession is also strictly determined by the protocol, with the guarantee of the Great Powers of Europe, Denmark, and Sweden. Since the Duchy of Schleswig is Danish, however, we should strive to change the status quo in our favor, and integrate the predominantly Danish duchy into Denmark."
denmark.202.a: "Onward for Denmark!"
denmark.203.t: "DEBUG: Hidden Event Calculating 1858 Folketing Election Results"
denmark.203.d: "Hidden"
denmark.204.t: "The 1858 Folketing Elections"
denmark.204.d_historical: "The election results are in, and it looks like the national liberals are victorious. Although they could not secure an overall majority, they look destined to be the dominant force in Danish politics for the time being, whilst the social liberals and the conservatives will have to fight for temporary alliances with the national liberals if they want to push their agendas."
denmark.204.d_althistory_social_liberals: "The election results are in, and it looks like the social liberals have managed to achieve what is undoubtedly a surprise victory. Although their advantage over the other parties is rather slim and they could not secure an overall majority, they look determined to be the leading force in Danish politics for the time being, whilst the national liberals and the conservatives will have to fight for temporary alliances with the social liberals or one another if they want to push their agendas. But other possibilities for building a government are also still on the cards."
denmark.204.d_althistory_liberals: "The election results are in, and it looks like the national liberals have been able to secure a tremendous victory. They almost managed to secure an overall majority and look destined to be the dominant force in Danish politics for the time being, whilst the social liberals and the conservatives will have to fight for temporary alliances with the national liberals if they want to push their agendas."
denmark.204.d_althistory_conservatives: "The election results are in, and it looks like the conservatives have managed to achieve what is somewhat of a surprise victory. Although their advantage over the other parties is rather slim and they could not secure an overall majority, they look determined to be the leading force in Danish politics for the time being, whilst the national liberals and the social liberals will have to fight for temporary alliances with the conservatives or one another if they want to push their agendas. But other possibilities for building a government are also still on the cards."
denmark.204.a: "What will this mean?"
denmark.205.t: "The Social Liberal Government"
denmark.205.d: "The social liberal party, also known as 'Bondevennernes Selskab', or the Society of the Friends of Peasants, has secured a victory in the 1858 Folketing Elections. Their agenda is one of progress and social justice for all of Denmark's people. Their main voter base are the rural peasantry as well as parts of the left-leaning bourgeoisie, and it is likely that their policies will be focused around these groups. They are going to face an uphill battle though, since they are being carefully eyed by the opposition in the Folketing, and their support doesn't extent into the upper house, the Landstinget, where conservative elites and the rich and more traditional bourgeoisie remain in power. Overcoming these obstacles will be crucial to their success."
denmark.205.a: "This will surely be interesting."
denmark.206.t: "The National Liberal Government"
denmark.206.d: "'De Nationalliberale' is the national liberal party of Denmark. Their policy is one of economic freedom and moderate societal progress, along with an emphasis on forwarding Danish national interests in the world and in the helstaten. The party has already been running the government for the last few years, and it is likely that they will continue on their path. Their main voter base are middle-class intellectuals and capitalists, some of whom have accumulated large sums of money and even seats in the Danish upper house, the Landstinget. Based on their support, the National Liberals look set to govern Denmark for the foreseeable future."
denmark.206.a: "Continuity it is."
denmark.207.t: "The Conservative Government"
denmark.207.d: "The conservative strata of the Danish population has gathered in or around the 'Højre' party, which translated to 'the Right' in English. After securing a surprise victory in the recent election, the conservative elites are set to run the country for the foreseeable future. Their main voter base is the land-owning aristocracy, along with those portions of the upper middle-class who view traditional values and religion highly. Their main foundation used to be their strong presence in the Danish upper house, the Landstinget, but with their success in the second chamber, the Folketing, the conservatives now look destined to push their political agenda forward."
denmark.207.a: "Will this mean peace and calm?"
denmark.208.t: "Carl Christian Hall in Difficulties"
denmark.208.d: "[DEN.GetLeader] seems in trouble. His policies have been met with increasing criticism as of late, and the President of the Council, who practically is the Danish prime minister, is said to be contemplating his resignation. Especially the still undecided question of both Schleswig's and Holstein's desirable status in the helstaten remains a hot topic. Whilst hardliners are criticizing that Hall's policies do not go far enough, the proponents of the status quo are calling him out for steering Denmark on a dangerous path. It remains to be seen whether Hall can weather the storm."
denmark.208.a: "What will come of this?"
denmark.209.t: "Carl Eduard Rotwitt Takes Office as Statsminister"
denmark.209.d: "In what are breaking news from the capitol, it appears that [DEN.GetLeader] has resigned from his office as prime minister. The national liberal politician has, thus, gave in to pressure from both sides of the political spectrum. Carl Eduard Rotwitt looks set to take over the government. The social liberal politician is among the most conservative wing in his party, and can be considered a bridge builder between the two liberal parties, who are expected to work together more closely in the near future."
denmark.209.a: "Will this cause a shift in policy?"
denmark.210.t: "Death of Carl Eduard Rotwitt"
denmark.210.d: "[DEN.GetLeader] died tragically last night. His passing comes very sudden, with the late prime minister only being 47 years of age. Rotwitt was considered to be one of the most important and influential politicians in Denmark over the last decade, and his loss will be felt deeply across almost the entire political spectrum of the country. It is currently uncertain who will take over as head of government."
denmark.210.a: "What a tragedy!"
denmark.211.t: "Carl Christian Hall Takes over as Statsminister"
denmark.211.d: "After less than three months out of office, Carl Christian Hall has once again take over the position as head of government. Although this decision may seem like a surprise, Hall seems to have used his time out of office very effectively. He appears to have made new friends amongst his peers as well as persuaded some the inner-party opposition of his reform plans. It will certainly be interesting to see whether he can succeed this time."
denmark.211.a: "He deserves a second chance."
denmark.212.t: "The Social Liberal Government Fails to Gain Sufficient Support"
denmark.212.d: "Facing significant political obstacles and opposition across the Folketing, the social liberal government has failed to gain sufficient support to stay in power. The respective ministers have stepped down and the future of Danish politics hangs in the balance once again."
denmark.212.a: "What now?"
denmark.213.t: "DEBUG: Hidden Event Calculating Folketing Re-Election after Social Liberals' Failure"
denmark.213.d: "Hidden"
denmark.214.t: "Folketing Re-Elections"
denmark.214.d: "Following the resignation of the social liberal government a few weeks ago, the monarch had to call a re-election of the Folketing. Yesterday, the Danish citizens who are eligible to vote were able to cast their vote, and the results have just arrived."
denmark.214.a: "The National Liberals are Victorious"
denmark.214.b: "The Conservatives are Victorious"
denmark.214.c: "It's a close call..."
denmark.215.t: "Who Should Lead the New Government?"
denmark.215.d: "Following the very close election results, the decision who should head the new government hangs in the balance. Who should lead the country in the future?"
denmark.215.a: "The National Liberals"
denmark.215.b: "The Conservatives"

denmark.309.a: "We agree."
denmark.309.b: "We reject their offer."

denmark.401.t: "The State of Our Colonies"
denmark.401.d_nicobars: "We used to be one of the major colonial powers with possessions across the globe from the 17th century until just recently, when it became apparent that our economic and military strength would not be sufficient to keep a global empire together. Just a few years ago, we sold our last remaining trade posts and forts in Africa as well as our remaining footholds on the Indian mainland to the British. What remains of the former Danish colonies are the scarcely populated Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean and the Danish West Indies, consisting of the islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, who hold roughly 40,000 souls. There is potential to make those possessions profitable, but we would need to invest first."
denmark.401.d_no_nicobars: "We used to be one of the major colonial powers with possessions across the globe from the 17th century until just recently, when it became apparent that our economic and military strength would not be sufficient to keep a global empire together. Just a few years ago, we sold our last remaining trade posts and forts in Africa as well as our remaining footholds on the Indian mainland to the British. Now, everything that is left of the former Danish colonies are the Danish West Indies, consisting of the islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, who hold roughly 40,000 souls. There is potential to make those colonies profitable, but we would need to invest first."
denmark.401.a: "Where shall we go from here?"
denmark.402.t: "Colonial Expansion in the Caribbean?"
denmark.402.d: "Danish colonial merchants and enthusiasts have approached our government with an inquiry about a possible acquisition of St. Barthélemy island, which is part of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean and currently owned by Sweden. Our informants claim that they have valid intel that suggests Sweden would be more than willing to sell the island for a reasonable price. Should we sent an offer to the Swedish government to purchase the island and, with that, expand our colonial empire?"
denmark.402.a: "Approach the Swedes with an offer."
denmark.402.b: "No, thanks. That's likely not going to be profitable."
denmark.403.t: "[DEN.GetNameDef] Asks to Buy St. Barthélemy"
denmark.403.d: "The Danish government has approached us with an offer for St. Barthélemy, the Caribbean island currently under our control. The island has proven to be a financial burden in the recent past, and factions within parliament are asking to get rid of it as soon as possible. If we agree, we would lose a colonial possession but profit financially. How should we respond?"
denmark.403.a: "Agree to sell the island."
denmark.403.b: "Reject their offer."
denmark.404.t: "[SWE.GetNameDef] Agrees to Sell St. Barthélemy"

The Copenhagen Sea Fortress will definitely be back on the table, and as an artillery officer, Lundbye might be determined to increase influence and status of this branch of the armed forces.

#Economy/Industry
DEN_focus_danish_economy: "Danish Economy"
DEN_focus_danish_economy_desc: "Denmark is still a largely agrarian nation, with much of our economy relying on farming. However, if this status quo is allowed to continue our nation will fall behind its neighbors, as well as carrying the risk that if significant changes in the prices of food occur our economy could collapse. To provide our people with the goods, opportunities, and security they require we must begin further industrialization."
DEN_focus_abolition_of_the_sound_toll: "The Abolition of the Sound Toll"
DEN_focus_abolition_of_the_sound_toll_desc: "The Sound Toll had been an essential part of our government income for centuries, but its effect on our economy was proven to be quite negative. We must bear the weight of this loss in order to improve the strength of our economy and improve our relations with our neighbors and trade partners. With the reasonable compensation we have received for the abolition, we should immediately invest those funds into other projects."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_projects: "Infrastructure Projects"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_projects_desc: "In order to utilize our industrial buildup in ways which will benefit our citizens, we will modernize our infrastructure. These improvements will allow faster communication, better trade, and increase the ease of travel for goods and people across the nation. Once these improvements have been made, we could even begin work on even more modern initiatives to supplement what we have already constructed."
DEN_focus_aarhus_randers_railway: "The Aarhus-Randers Railway Line"
DEN_focus_aarhus_randers_railway_desc: "Randers is one of the most prominent cities of Jutland, and is one of the most important centers for the agricultural industry. Aarhus on the other hand has long been a major center for industrial processing of agricultural products, as well as a major trade center. By connecting the two cities we can unite the region closer together, as well as significantly bolstering the economies of both cities."
DEN_focus_fredericia_aarhus_railway: "The Fredericia-Aarhus Railway Line"
DEN_focus_fredericia_aarhus_railway_desc: "Fredericia has two roles: it acts as a port and as a center for the production of innovative goods and other industries. Due to this, connecting it to the economic powerhouse of Aarhus, which has its own ports and industries, would allow a greater interconnectedness between both of their economies, as well as providing a corridor further south in the kingdom. With this effort we can connect the nation, its goods, and our people."
DEN_focus_lille_syd_railway: "The Lille Syd Railway Line"
DEN_focus_lille_syd_railway_desc: "While our rail line from Copenhagen to Korsør was completed years ago, further rail lines could help further improve the economy of Zealand. With an additional line that connects to our already constructed rail, we can connect previously neglected areas of Zealand, helping to improve the lives of those living away from the capital and the strength of Copenhagen's position."
DEN_focus_odense_svendborg_railway: "The Odense-Svendborg Railway Line"
DEN_focus_odense_svendborg_railway_desc: "Odense has found itself as the second largest city of Denmark, and dominates its island of Funen. By connecting Odense to Svendborg in the south we can promote the economy of both cities, as well as helping to interconnect our nation to a greater extent. This effort would solidify the place of Odense, and hopefully improve the lives of people across both the island and our nation."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_bornholm: "Improve Infrastructure on Bornholm"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_bornholm_desc: "Bornholm is somewhat isolated compared to the rest of Denmark, and while bridges between other islands could be considered, Bornholm can never be connected directly to Zealand. Therefore, to improve the situation for our citizens on Bornholm we must make investments into their local infrastructure with a focus on the development of the region itself, rather than its interconnectedness."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_iceland: "Improve Infrastructure on Iceland"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_iceland_desc: "Iceland is distant from our main islands, but has strategic importance and provides useful resources as well as a strong fishing industry. Additional improvements to its infrastructure. These efforts could potentially strengthen the already present economy of the island, and give local and national investors the opportunity for further investment and development of the island."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_faroe_islands: "Improve Infrastructure on the Faroe Islands"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_faroe_islands_desc: "The Faroe Islands closely border Great Britain, and like most of our other islands rely heavily on their fishing industry. Improving the local infrastructure could provide opportunities to reduce this reliance, and to improve the size and economic capabilities of its ports and cities."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_greenland: "Improve Infrastructure in Greenland"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_greenland_desc: "Isolated and sparsely populated, Greenland's main value lies in its natural resources and fishing industries. By improving the infrastructure there we can increase our control of the land, as well as give us the opportunity to extract the island's natural riches."
DEN_focus_demographic_development: "Demographic Development"
DEN_focus_demographic_development_desc: "A massive increase in agricultural output, as well as medical and sanitation improvements across our nation have caused a massive rise in life expectancy and is allowing our nation's population to grow rapidly. Across our nation more of our citizens are surviving childhood, people are having more children and more hands are contributing to our economy."
DEN_focus_copenhagen_sewerage: "København Sewerage System"
DEN_focus_copenhagen_sewerage_desc: "Establishing a united sewage system for our capital will improve the safety and hygiene of the city greatly. With our current practices, waste can cause diseases to appear and spread, putting our citizens at risk. By removing this issue, Copenhagen can become a city that truly befits the quality of our nation."
DEN_focus_rapid_urbanization: "Rapid Urbanization"
DEN_focus_rapid_urbanization_desc: "While our economy may still largely rely on agricultural activity, its new industrial scale combined with the opportunities and wealth available in cities has been driving many away from the countryside and into our cities. We must facilitate this growth and help it to continue or increase due to the reliance of our new industrial efforts on a continually expanding workforce."
DEN_focus_improve_public_hygiene: "Improve Public Hygiene"
DEN_focus_improve_public_hygiene_desc: "While urbanization has consistently grown the size of our cities, the sanitation of our cities has often been unable to keep up. By investing into sanitation works such as sewers we can make our cities far safer for our citizens to live in, and ensure that outbreaks of disease are less dangerous and more contained."
DEN_focus_population_boom: "Population Boom"
DEN_focus_population_boom_desc: "Changes to hygiene, medical care, and the availability of food have allowed our population to balloon in recent years, granting our nation a great future. While this change can be seen in the size of many of our lesser cities, it is also allowing the population of the villages across the nation to grow, and our greatest cities have seen their populations expand as well."
DEN_focus_industrialization_efforts: "Industrialization Efforts"
DEN_focus_industrialization_efforts_desc: "To truly keep our economy competitive with our neighbors and on the international scene, a great focus must be placed on industrialization. Much of this effort will have to be focused on the development of agriculture to a greater scale, as well as developing an ability to process the products of our own agriculture. In addition to this our central position as the only way in and out of the Baltic can give our economy a perfect opportunity to process goods from one side of the sea and sell it on the other end."
DEN_focus_hassel_teudt: "Hassel & Teudt"
DEN_focus_hassel_teudt_desc: "The entrepreneurs J.G. Fridolin Hassel and Ludvig F. Teudt have established a factory in Copenhagen which bears both their names. It produces metal goods and hopefully will represent a great trend of industrialization in our capital, bringing more and more entrepreneurs and businesses to our great city."
DEN_focus_hansen_writing_ball: "The Hansen Writing Ball"
DEN_focus_hansen_writing_ball_desc: "Writing has remained largely the same since the invention of the printing press. That is, until the reverend Rasmus Malling-Hansen invented his Writing Ball. It allows the user to write using keys pushed inwards rather than with a hand or with a traditional printing press. This revolution in writing will be exported to many who desire it, although it currently is unfortunately still being hand crafted."
DEN_focus_carlsberg_company: "Carlsberg-Bryggerier"
DEN_focus_carlsberg_company_desc: ""
DEN_focus_carlsberg_company_effect_tt: "§GCarlsberg can be selected for a company partnership.§!"
DEN_focus_dfds_company: "Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab"
DEN_focus_dfds_company_desc: "As a nation placed at a crossroad like Denmark is, as well as one with so many ports and such a long coastline, a highly developed shipping industry is only natural. However, much of the strength of the industry is divided. If the three strongest steamship shipping companies were united into one, singular, company our maritime fleets could gain a far stronger position in the Baltic and North Sea."
DEN_focus_dfds_company_effect_tt: "§GDFDS can be selected for a company partnership.§!"
DEN_focus_economic_future: "Economic Future"
DEN_focus_economic_future_desc: "Denmark is a nation at many crossroads. We are the only way in and out of the Baltic Sea, caught with an unhappy alliance with Great Britain, and trying to hold a foot in both the Scandinavian world and the German one. However, we cannot stand on the precipice forever, and eventually a decision must be made. What does the future hold for Denmark and her people?"
DEN_focus_our_future_scandinavia: "Our Future Lies in Scandinavia"
DEN_focus_our_future_scandinavia_desc: "Although our history with our Scandinavian neighbors has often been violent and our rivalries are long established, our mutual histories and proximities bring us closer than our history can tear us apart. While our relations with other European nations can be fickle, establishing close cooperation with our neighbors can establish the stability that our nation needs to be able to thrive moving forward."
DEN_focus_found_the_danske_bank: "Den Danske Landmandsbank"
DEN_focus_found_the_danske_bank_desc: "While Denmark already has a national bank, the establishment of a commercial bank, particularly one which is focused on our farmers can significantly benefit our economy, providing funds for the expansion of industries, and the development of new ones. The additional development of banks within our nation can provide the funds required for our planned industrial expansion."
DEN_focus_scandinavian_monetary_union: "The Scandinavian Monetary Union"
DEN_focus_scandinavian_monetary_union_desc: "With our alignment towards our Scandinavian neighbors, a monetary union would only be natural. By tying our economy and currency to our neighbors we can bring great benefits to our own nation, as well as our neighbors, and ensure that all trade is conducted fairly and easily. This greater integration will help to make the ties our nations have shared practical as well as political and cultural."
DEN_focus_scandinavian_monetary_union_trigger_tt: "§YThe third preliminary meeting for the Scandinavian Monetary Union has taken place in Copenhagen.§!"
DEN_focus_replace_the_rigsdaler_with_the_krone: "Replace the Rigsdaler with the Krone"
DEN_focus_replace_the_rigsdaler_with_the_krone_desc: "In order to better integrate our economy with our Scandinavian brothers, we must abandon our old Rigsdaler. Instead, we will adopt the Krone and bring ourselves closer to our neighbors. This monetary union will unite our economies and our commerce together, and promote unity politically at the same time."
DEN_focus_our_future_germany: "Our Future Lies in Germany"
DEN_focus_our_future_germany_desc: "Denmark has had half a step in Germany on and off for almost a millennium. Even today, Holstein and Schleswig tie us to our southern neighbors. While many expect us to align with our Scandinavian neighbors, the growing might of Prussia and other German nations could offer us an alternate future."
DEN_focus_join_the_zollverein: "Ask to Join the Zollverein"
DEN_focus_join_the_zollverein_desc: "Few consider Denmark to be a “German” nation, but we certainly have deep ties to the Germans in both our history and in the present. In light of this, we could request to join the Zollverein. Our addition to the Zollverein would strengthen both sides' economies, all it requires is that the Germans will allow our induction."
DEN_focus_dano_german_monetary_union: "The Dano-German Monetary Union"
DEN_focus_dano_german_monetary_union_desc: "We have already aligned our economy with Germany, and taking steps to make our economies even more integrated and trade more streamlined will benefit us greatly. To this end, we will enter a monetary union with our southern neighbor, tying us together even further."
DEN_focus_replace_the_rigsdaler_with_the_mark: "Replace the Rigsdaler with the Mark"
DEN_focus_replace_the_rigsdaler_with_the_mark_desc: "With our alignment with Germany, we will officially abandon the Rigsdaler, and instead replace it with the German Mark. This move will help to unite our economy with the might of our southern neighbor."
DEN_focus_second_industrial_revolution: "The Second Industrial Revolution"
DEN_focus_second_industrial_revolution_desc: "While the first industrial revolution brought massive changes to our economy, many of the changes were sequestered away or only shocking in their scale and efficiency. Today, the changes technology brings are creating never before seen wonders that will change the lives of those across both Denmark, and Europe. Rail lines criss-crossing the entire nation, great ships of steel, and even more wonders yet unseen are being built, and our nation will benefit from them all!"

#Politics
DEN_focus_carl_christian_halls_presidency: "A New Presidency"
DEN_focus_carl_christian_halls_presidency_desc: "Following the retirement of Carl Christoffer Georg Andræ, his young successor Carl Christian Hall, both from the liberal spectrum of Danish politics, has taken over the position of Konseilspræsident, or head of government. Only 45 years of ago, Hall stands for the new generation of Danish liberals. He supports economic growth and industrialization, but even more importantly he hasn't made a secret of his ambition to unite the Danish holding not only under one state and monarch, but also under one constitution. His program, the so-called Konstitutionelle Helstat, is as ambitious as it is controversial, and risks plunging Denmark into another war over the predominantly German duchies of Schleswig and Holstein."
DEN_focus_forming_the_cabinet: "Forming the Cabinet"
DEN_focus_forming_the_cabinet_desc: "[DEN.GetLeader]'s first task is the formation of a cabinet to keep the Danish government functional. The new head of government's choice of ministers consists of some illustrious names of Danish politics, but also has a fairly prominent military nature. It is expected that not only the navy and war ministries, but also the foreign office will be staffed in part with military-related personnel. What that means for the outlook of Danish policy remains to be seen."
DEN_focus_addressing_our_policies: "Addressing our Policies"
DEN_focus_addressing_our_policies_desc: "Of course, after a change of leadership in government, the people also expect some adjustments in our policies. The new Konseilspræsident has some ideas of his own and will likely count on the support of his peers to make them a reality. His party, the national liberals, look destined to solve the trade disputes that currently hamper industry and prosperity, but the party wing that supported Hall's rise to presidency certainly also has ambitions towards a closer integration of the duchies in the south."
DEN_focus_adopting_the_eider_policy: "Adopting the Eider Policy"
DEN_focus_adopting_the_eider_policy_desc: "[DEN.GetLeader]'s political program, the Konstitutionelle Helstat, aims to integrate the Duchy of Schleswig much more closely into the Kingdom of Denmark, sharing a constitution and seperating it from the Duchy of Holstein south of the Eider river, which is almost exclusively populated by Germans and also part of the German Confederation. This is most probably going to create some controversy, as the London Protocol of 1851 states that the duchies should be left as independent entities and that Schleswig should not be constitutionally tied more closely to Denmark than Holstein..."
DEN_focus_a_free_liberal_economy: "Our Dream of a Free Liberal Economy"
DEN_focus_a_free_liberal_economy_desc: "The classic liberal ideal of free trade and enterprise is also very strongly felt among [DEN.GetLeader]'s peers in the liberal party, and they will surely try to dismantle barriers for trade and industry throughout the helstaten, but first they will have to solve the trade disputes surrounding Copenhagen."
DEN_focus_the_copenhagen_trade_crisis: "Intervening in the Copenhagen Trade Crisis"
DEN_focus_the_copenhagen_trade_crisis_desc: "Denmark has been struck by the global economic crisis that started in the US and by December of 1857 had larger ramifications across the globe. The city of Copenhagen used to rely heavily on tariffs, but with the Sound Toll now gone, trade has become even more important. However, old institutions and individuals hold privileges and monopolies on trade and crafts in the capital, and they are hampering growth. The economic crisis makes their grip on the Copenhagen trade even tighter. We must deal with these issues before our economy can thrive again."
DEN_focus_the_copenhagen_trade_crisis_trigger_tt: "The §YPanic of 1857§! has happened."
DEN_focus_the_1858_elections: "The 1858 Elections"
DEN_focus_the_1858_elections_desc: "The Elections of 1858 are getting near, and the eligible voters will certainly express their desires and whether they are happy with what we've accomplished in government so far. Three candidates seem to stand a serious chance of winning this election and the outcome is set to shape the future of Danish politics for the next three years."
#Social Liberals
DEN_focus_a_coalition_of_the_left: "A Coalition of the Left"
DEN_focus_a_coalition_of_the_left_desc: "The forces of the left have secured a victory, and the time for a more socially just approach to Danish politics has finally come. We have the chance to set a positive example for the rest of Europe, let's use it!"
DEN_focus_a_government_of_the_people: "A Government of the People"
DEN_focus_a_government_of_the_people_desc: "Similar to pretty much all of Europe's monarchies, matters of the Danish state and politics have been dominated by nobility, only rather recently joined by the upper classes of the grande bourgeoisie. The people who keep the country running, however, have been exploited throughout history. It's time to finally change this injustice and give the people the means to make their voices heard."
DEN_focus_contain_the_resistance: "Contain the Resistance"
DEN_focus_contain_the_resistance_desc: "There is strong resistance against our social liberal ideologies, and we must overcome these obstacles if we want to have a chance to shape the upcoming era of Danish politics. If we fail, however, this could very quickly turn into a disaster and set a bad example for the social justice agenda across Europe."
DEN_focus_implement_social_liberal_policies: "Implement Social Liberal Policies"
DEN_focus_implement_social_liberal_policies_desc: "It's time to follow through on our promises to the people prior to the election. In order to keep our word and please our voters we need to implement the social liberal policies we have been talking about up to this point. Let's not fool ourselves, though. Strong resistance is to be expected."
DEN_focus_act_as_representative_of_the_rural_people: "Act as Representative of the Rural People"
DEN_focus_act_as_representative_of_the_rural_people_desc: "The rural folk have been essential in securing our victory. They have been feeling left out and without proper representation in the country's parliamentary bodies for far too long now, and the disproportional representation of the wealthy land barons surely doesn't help to alleviate the situation. If we want to secure the continued support of the ordinary rural people, we will have to center our policies around them."
DEN_focus_creation_of_rural_commissions: "Creation of Rural Commissions"
DEN_focus_creation_of_rural_commissions_desc: "An important part in increasing the political weight and representation of ordinary rural folk in Denmark would be the creation of rural commissions. These commissions could then act as a political platform for the people from the countryside to express their concerns and beliefs, and they would also offer an opportunity for us to tighten our bonds with this important demographic."
DEN_focus_establish_legal_equality_of_the_peasantry: "Establish Legal Equality of the Peasantry"
DEN_focus_establish_legal_equality_of_the_peasantry_desc: "The peasantry has been oppressed in the eyes of the law for centuries now, and it is our duty to right this wrong. If Denmark is going to be considered a state of law, then the law itself has to consider everyone fairly and equally, and we can use our influence now to take the necessary steps to make it happen."
DEN_focus_protect_tenant_farmers_from_exploitation: "Protect Tenant Farmers from Exploitation"
DEN_focus_protect_tenant_farmers_from_exploitation_desc: "The wealthy landowners have been using their leverage over tenant farmers to squeeze every last dime out of them. International competition means that they had to find other ways of generating larger profits, but we mustn't allow them to exploit their tenant farmers in ways that are unjust and flat out inhumane."
DEN_focus_building_up_support_social_liberals: "Building up Support"
DEN_focus_building_up_support_social_liberals_desc: "With our policies now firmly underway, we must use our influence and leverage to build up support for the upcoming election."

DEN_focus_prepare_for_the_next_election_social_liberals_desc: "The next election is just around the corner and we must prepare."
#National Liberals
DEN_focus_a_coalition_of_the_center: "A Coalition of the Center"
DEN_focus_a_coalition_of_the_center_desc: "The people have spoken, and they have chosen the forces of the center to continue to lead Danish politics on a path of properity and progress, and we are determined to deliver on these promises."
DEN_focus_stability_and_progress: "Stability and Progress"
DEN_focus_stability_and_progress_desc: "The path that the people have chosen is one of stability and progress. Stability, in that the previous government can continue its promising first attempts to shape Danish politics, and progress in that the national liberals are destined to make liberal ideals of enlightenment, science, and individual liberty the foundations of our country."
DEN_focus_prepare_the_stage_for_liberal_policies: "Prepare the Stage for Liberal Policies"
DEN_focus_prepare_the_stage_for_liberal_policies_desc: "Our voters expect us to follow through on our promises of implementing liberal policies. With the growing support we enjoy among the parliamentary ranks of the houses, we can now make the necessary arrangements to turn our political beliefs into reality."
DEN_focus_focus_on_reforming_the_country: "Focus on Reforming the Country"
DEN_focus_focus_on_reforming_the_country_desc: "Let's not fool ourselves, many laws and institutions in Denmark need to be reformed in order to live up to our ideals of enlightenment and freedom. The old ways are simply not going to be successful anymore in this day and age, and we have to make sure the responsible people understand that and act accordingly."
DEN_focus_liberal_economic_reforms: "Liberal Economic Reforms"
DEN_focus_liberal_economic_reforms_desc: "An important part of liberal ideals have always been economic reforms. We believe that the individual entrepreneur has the best chance to make the right choice at any given point, if only he has the opportunity to actually do so. In order to enable capitalists to make these decisions we need to adapt some aspects of our economic laws and practices."
DEN_focus_enforce_the_freedom_of_trade_act_of_1857: "Enforce the Freedom of Trade Act of 1857"
DEN_focus_enforce_the_freedom_of_trade_act_of_1857_desc: "Denmark, at least on paper, has already established freedom of trade for goods entering and leaving the country. However, in practice there are still obstacles to free trade in place, and old-established institutions and individuals still cling tight to their former privileges. We have to make sure they accept the new realities and acknowledge freedom of trade across all parts of the country."
DEN_focus_act_as_the_center_of_danish_politics: "Act as the Centre of Danish Politics"
DEN_focus_act_as_the_center_of_danish_politics_desc: "The forces of the left and right have more drastic changes in mind than we are ready to implement. Our best chance of success is to act as the center of Danish politics, and to make enlightened and pragmatic decisions along the way. We must not let ideological crusaders tempt us into reaching rash decisions that might cause more harm than they do good in the end."
DEN_focus_cooperate_with_the_conservatives: "Cooperate with the Conservatives"
DEN_focus_cooperate_with_the_conservatives_desc: "Moderate conservatives have reached out with an offer for cooperation. Whilst there are, albeit smaller, differences in the respective political outlooks, a cooperation would certainly enable us to secure support for our policies more easily. It might mean that we need to make compromises, but then we will have to ponder from case to case whether something is better than nothing, or whether we are better off focusing on ourselves."
DEN_focus_prepare_social_liberal_policies: "Prepare Social Liberal Policies"
DEN_focus_prepare_social_liberal_policies_desc: "The new leadership is somewhat different in terms of their political ideology, with a stronger focus on social justice and individual liberty. This is not necessarily an issue, though, and we can make sure that all members of the coalition are happy if we are prepared to make some concessions to their political outlook."
DEN_focus_building_up_support_liberals: "Building up Support"
DEN_focus_building_up_support_liberals_desc: "With our policies now firmly underway, we must use our influence and leverage to build up support for the upcoming election."

#Conservatives
DEN_focus_a_coalition_of_the_right: "A Coalition of the Right"
DEN_focus_a_coalition_of_the_right_desc: "The forces of the political right have emerged victorious from the election, and our time has come to take the reins. With the right set of policies we can shape the upcoming era of Danish politics."
DEN_focus_a_conservative_government: "A Conservative Government"
DEN_focus_a_conservative_government_desc: "The old ways have proven relatively successful for Denmark thus far. More recent shortcomings, like the loss of our personal union with Norway in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, were caused by forces outside of our control. Although our dynastic situation is certainly not ideal, Danish conservatism is destined to prove itself on the international stage as well as domestically."
DEN_focus_gather_support_for_conservative_policies: "Gather Support for Conservative Policies"
DEN_focus_gather_support_for_conservative_policies_desc: "The conservative elites are still the decisive force in Denmark, both politically and economically, and the recent election supports that notion. But in order to make sure that our beliefs are translated into action, we need to gather more support. As ruling party, we are at liberty to choose the potential partners based on the individual item on the agenda, and it would be wise to take advantage of this."
DEN_focus_support_the_rejection_of_universal_suffrage: "Support the Rejection of Universal Suffrage"
DEN_focus_support_the_rejection_of_universal_suffrage_desc: "The forces of the left are trying to implement universal suffrage. This is a problem, since people who pay little to no taxes and, thus, are not contributing as much to our country, would have the same voice in elections as our peers. The weight of one's vote should always be determined by how much one can contribute."
DEN_focus_support_from_landowners_and_guilds: "Support from Landowners and Guilds"
DEN_focus_support_from_landowners_and_guilds_desc: "It would be wise to secure support from those demographics and institutions that are likely to have a similar outlook on politics to our's. Whilst landowners are obviously our main target audience, and their continued support is essential to our success, the guilds have recently come under great pressure from the previous liberal government. Accomodating them with some political favors could come a long way to guarantee their goodwill in the future."
DEN_focus_ensuring_the_kings_support: "Ensuring the King's Support"
DEN_focus_ensuring_the_kings_support_desc: "The king is the center of our monarchy, and although the dynastic situation leaves a lot to be desired, we have to make the most of the opportunities presented to us. By emphasizing the king's sacred position in the helstaten, we could do both, secure his support as well as strengthen the position of the privileged elites within the country."
DEN_focus_profit_from_the_landstinget_system: "Profit from the Landstinget System"
DEN_focus_profit_from_the_landstinget_system_desc: "The Landstinget is the upper house of the bicameral political system of Denmark, and only men above 40 with a very high income are eligible for election into the upper house. This practically ensures that a majority of the 51 members of the Landstinget hold conservative values highly, and we should do our best to profit from this fact."
DEN_focus_protect_the_helstaten_idea: "Protect the Helstaten Idea"
DEN_focus_protect_the_helstaten_idea_desc: "The helstaten is the entirety of the Danish state, and we must do our best to protect it from the forces who are trying to change the status of our individual holdings. The national liberals have proposed the idea of the Ejderpolitikken, which aims to integrate the Duchy of Schleswig closer into the Kingdom of Denmark. This would almost inevitably trigger another war with the German Confederation, and it's not a war we are likely to win. Thus, we should do everything in our power to protect the helstaten from this madness."

#Military
DEN_focus_danish_military: "Danish Military"
DEN_focus_danish_military_desc: "Our nation is perhaps not the most populous, and our military history may lack the prestige of our neighbors, but our successes in recent years and our strong international relations grant our military a strong position. No other tools at our disposal can protect our nation as well as our armed forces, and with the right care they can hold off almost every enemy until diplomacy can intervene. To ensure this, we must improve, reinforce, and modernize both our army and navy. If we fail to do so, we may find that history will crush us under its mighty foot, leaving us under the yoke of a foreign power..."
DEN_focus_lundbyes_acts: "Krigsministre Lundbye's Reforms"
DEN_focus_lundbyes_acts_desc: "Our Minister of War, Carl Lundbye, is held in very poor regard by many in our officer corps, but his ideas offer highly interesting alternatives to our current state of our affairs. His plans are to expand our permanent and professional military focuses, with a focus on the more scientific approaches to war, rather than the more traditional methods many of our officers favor. This view is rooted in his education, having been an artillery officer for many years, and his reforms are likely to benefit that branch heavily."

DEN_focus_army_modernization_efforts: "Army Modernization Efforts"
DEN_focus_army_modernization_efforts_desc: "Despite our successes against the Germans in the First Schleswig War, our army is woefully outdated. Our men are equipped with outdated weapons, led with inferior methods, and most of our warplans rely more on optimism than our actual capabilities. We must begin reforming our army before it's too late and we are faced with a real war. We will begin by deciding who will lead these reforms, and then tackle issues such as equipment and training."
DEN_focus_thestrup_army_reforms: "Krigsministre Thestrup's Army Reforms"
DEN_focus_thestrup_army_reforms_desc: "Thestrup believes that the future of the military is not the career soldier, but rather the conscript. Mass conscription has been a winning factor in wars for decades now, originating with Napoleon's 'Levée en masse', which quickly proved a decisive advantage. Our nation may lack similar population numbers than our neighbors, but relying on a military of our current scale could doom us. Perhaps this won't bring our military to the same scale as others, but it will bring us closer to parity. This parity must be our and Thestrup's goal, and we will work hard to achieve it."
DEN_focus_thestrup_army_reforms_trigger_tt: "Requires §YHans Nicolai Thestrup§! as War Minister in the §YMilitary High Command§!."
DEN_focus_artillery_modernization_efforts: "Artillery Modernization Efforts"
DEN_focus_artillery_modernization_efforts_desc: "Artillery has been essential to warfare for centuries, but advances in recent years have rapidly and drastically altered its effectiveness. In order to properly utilize these advancements ourselves, and to prevent ourselves from being their victim, we must modernize our own artillery forces. Thestrup's supervision will be essential in these efforts, and superior artillery may be exactly what our army needs to be able to compete against our foes."
DEN_focus_espingoles: "Espingoles"
DEN_focus_espingoles_desc: "A uniquely Danish weapon, the Espingole, unlike what the name would suggest, is not a blunderbuss. Instead it is a rapid fire weapon capable of firing much faster than any individual artillery gun our neighbors possess. This fact, as well as its unique Danishness, have pushed us towards adopting it. Further testing and production could prove the worth of the weapon on the battlefield, and possibly allow us to develop more advanced forms of the weapon. Once these tests have finished, we could even enter mass production and both, adopt it within our military and export it internationally for profit."
DEN_focus_prince_christians_commission: "Prince Christian's Commission"
DEN_focus_prince_christians_commission_desc: "Many in Denmark view the heir to the throne, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, as a foreigner. Though they aren't necessarily wrong, this perception could be dangerous if allowed to persist. Despite having been born outside of Denmark, he will one day be our king and therefore we must help to integrate him into Denmark. Considering that his father served as an officer and his own graduation from the military academy of Copenhagen, we will commission him as an officer and begin his service to Denmark. We can only hope that his time in our army will prove worthwhile, and that it will perhaps change the public's perception of our prince."
DEN_focus_wartime_battalion_duplication: "Wartime Battalion Expansion"
DEN_focus_wartime_battalion_duplication_desc: "An important part of improving our army will be an actual expansion of its numbers. To this end we will recruit and train more soldiers to join our battalions once war is looming. While we may have some difficulties finding the manpower, the improvements we have made within our armed forces should ease the process. With these professionals we will show the great strength of the nation and her soldiers. With such expansion our fortresses will be properly guarded, our cannons fully manned, and our forces able to meet our enemies."
DEN_focus_rifle_modernization_efforts: "Rifle Modernization Efforts"
DEN_focus_rifle_modernization_efforts_desc: "Our current rifles are not sufficient to face our rivals, and we must seek out replacements to keep pace. Adopting such weapons will greatly increase the deadliness and efficiency of our soldiers, with the increased firing rates being nthe most visible improvement. Our nation has many minds capable of creating such rifles, and utilizing these talents will not only ease the process by localizing it, but also create national pride for our own talents. If we fail to use our own talents to meet the needs of our military, the successes of the past may never be repeated."
DEN_focus_promote_talented_army_leaders: "Promote Talented Army Leaders"
DEN_focus_promote_talented_army_leaders_desc: "Our nation, like many others, has often prioritized wealthy and well-connected officers for promotions. While this has not always been an official stance, its occurrence has often left qualified officers behind while less competent but upper-class officers surpassed them. To help improve the performance and ability of our officers we will begin an initiative to promote many of the most talented leaders into positions befitting their abilities. This change will help improve the morale of the common soldier, and hopefully will benefit the performance of our army on the field. We must hope that the upper class will quickly adapt to this new state of affairs."
DEN_focus_new_conscription_law: "New Conscription Law"
DEN_focus_new_conscription_law_desc: "Across Europe, conscription has become a common aspect of mobilization, and Denmark can be no different. Conscription is the only way for a nation of our size to be able to stand up against our foes. Without mass mobilization of our male population, Denmark could never field enough soldiers to defend the land against our enemies. We will reform our current conscription laws to be better able to utilize our manpower in wartime, and to prevent unnecessary burdens from being placed unto the wrong segments of society."
DEN_focus_frilodsmaend: "Frilodsmænd"
DEN_focus_frilodsmaend_desc: "A uniquely Danish type of conscription, the Frilodsmænd are those who are selected by lots to not take part in the typical 16 months of training of other soldiers, but instead are only called up when necessary. Despite this unique methods, the Frilodsmænd occupy a role similar to groups such as the Landwehr and other reserve groups in other nations. The purpose is to allow for mobilization of segments of the population larger than the professional military before mass conscription has taken place, granting an army larger than the government could support on a permanent basis. This grants us an excellent reserve of additional soldiers in emergencies, and helps to alleviate manpower issues we might face."
DEN_focus_increase_army_budget: "Increase Army Budget"
DEN_focus_increase_army_budget_desc: "Denmark's political situation and geographic position mean that we may find ourselves dragged into a war with our more powerful neighbors again in the future, and despite the hopes of some after the First Schleswig War, our army is currently insufficient for the tasks it might face. Increasing our budget will help to offset many of these issues by allowing a reorganization and refitting of the military to occur. The exact allocation of the budget will depend on the ideals, goals, and needs of our generals and war ministry, but it should significantly improve their position. Proper preparation can grant us the only chance we may have to emerge victorious, and such preparation will only be possible with a proper budget. We can only hope that these efforts will be enough to protect Denmark."
DEN_focus_navy_modernization: "Navy Modernization Efforts"
DEN_focus_navy_modernization_desc: "Denmark's position at a crossroad of naval trade forces us to maintain a fine balance of having our own powerful navy and not concerning the British. Our first priority will be to examine modern ships to identify their strengths and deficiencies, and then to design or purchase ships to replace many of our older and outdated vessels. If we are unable to improve our navy, our place in both the Baltic Sea and the North Sea could slip into irrelevance as we are unable to defend even our own coastlines. But if we succeed our position can be secured, and could even improve as we find our position unopposed."
DEN_focus_study_modern_warships: "Study Modern Warships"
DEN_focus_study_modern_warships_desc: "Our relationship with the British can grant us a perfect opportunity to observe what the current advances in naval technology are capable of. Our position is no longer as dominant as it has been in the past, but we can most certainly learn from others and regain some semblance of what we once had. Although Denmark has been at the forefront of naval technology at many times, the British and other Great Powers have created ships that older vessels are virtually incapable of combating, forcing a complete reassessment of our fleet."
DEN_focus_reinforced_hulls: "Reinforced Hulls"
DEN_focus_reinforced_hulls_desc: "While iron hulls are extremely effective, they are also very expensive. Due to this, merely reinforcing the hulls is often a very effective alternative. We may lack the resources or wealth to fully construct our ships from iron, but reinforced hulls should be enough for the time being. This should help us to utilize our current ships rather than sinking them, at least until we can replace them with more effective vessels."
DEN_focus_armored_schooners: "Danish Armored Schooners"
DEN_focus_armored_schooners_desc: "While development of large armored warships has been the focus for certain nations, armored schooners and corvettes are useful as faster and less expensive alternatives. This represents an extremely desirable option for our nation, as we lack the same resources and shipyards of other powers, and yet also need a large number of versatile ships. With these ships we can modernize our navy from the bottom up, as well as ensuring our most expensive ships are less likely to be made obsolete."
DEN_focus_monitor_turrets: "Monitor Turrets"
DEN_focus_monitor_turrets_desc: "Having seen their value proven in America, we will develop our own monitor turrets. These turrets have shown themselves very useful as they are almost impenetrable to much of the fire they could be subjected to, and yet they are extremely effective against other ships. When placed on a monitor they are only useful in shallow waters, but if they can be adjusted for other ship classes they will be unstoppable on the waters, as traditional methods of placing cannons will be rendered obsolete."
DEN_focus_rolf_krake: "Rolf Krake"
DEN_focus_rolf_krake_desc: "Our first all-iron steam-powered ship, the Rolf Krake, was designed by Cowper Phipps Coles, who installed his innovative turrets on the ship. The ship will be constructed in Scotland, where the experience of the British dockworkers in constructing such ships will benefit us, and both Britain and Denmark will see the worth of our technological advancements. This will only deepen our relationship with British shipbuilders, and potentially grant us opportunities to acquire more vessels in the future, and perhaps at even better prices. Exactly how these relationships work out has yet to be seen, but the Rolf Krake will be sufficient for now."
DEN_focus_modern_engines: "Modern Engines"
DEN_focus_modern_engines_desc: "While we have used steam engines in our ships before, we often employ outdated forms that are far less efficient than more recent inventions. What use is such technology when it is less efficient and less powerful than what other powers are using? To face this fact, we will research and develop more advanced engines that can be refitted onto our own ships, and also improve newly constructed ships as they are constructed. Proper refitting of our ships, and the development of more modern engines will also make it easier for us to keep up with such advances in the future, as the foundation is built for succeeding generations of improvement."
DEN_focus_screw_frigates: "Danish Screw Frigates"
DEN_focus_screw_frigates_desc: "Screw frigates have shown their worth across the world, and their speed and efficiency is truly admirable. Building and utilizing such ships could benefit Denmark greatly, and so we will begin designing and constructing our own. This should reduce the costs compared to purchasing such vessels, while keeping the funds used within our own economy. Most importantly, expanding our ability to construct such ship classes will only make it easier to construct similar vessels in the future as our knowledge and skill will undoubtedly grow in the process."
DEN_focus_atlantic_naval_bases: "Atlantic Naval Ports"
DEN_focus_atlantic_naval_bases_desc: "Most of our current naval bases are located in Jutland or on one of our main islands. However, we do have possessions much further afield that we could make use of to immensely increase our operational capacity. This would allow our navy to defend all waters claimed by our nation and allow us to project our power far away from our territory. We should begin to construct naval bases upon these islands, which will grant us and ours allies strategic strongholds far away from the homeland."
DEN_focus_modern_naval_tactics: "Modern Naval Tactics"
DEN_focus_modern_naval_tactics_desc: "With the immense development in naval technology in recent years, naval tactics have shifted greatly as well. Despite this, Denmark has not adopted many of these new advancements thus far. We will have to change this, to ensure that our navy can keep the place it deserves within the Baltic region and beyond. We will study and adopt many of the most recent and innovative naval tactics that make proper use of the technological advances currently available. We may even be able to rely upon other nations for advice if not directly training under their officers."
DEN_focus_increase_navy_budget: "Increase Navy Budget"
DEN_focus_increase_navy_budget_desc: "Ships are not cheap now, and they are certainly not going to get any getting cheaper soon. However, we must bear the cost of expanding our navy, or else our tenuous position will be crushed by our jealous neighbors. We are surrounded by too many potential foes, and have kept our relatively dominant position too long to risk losing it. We must do whatever we can to avoid such fate. We will increase the budget of our navy and ensure it is allocated properly, before we are outmatched and eventually eclipsed and destroyed."
DEN_focus_prepare_next_war: "Prepare for the Next War"
DEN_focus_prepare_next_war_desc: "War is on the horizon. At one time it seemed so unlikely considering our international connections and our grand victories, but unfortunately our nation will soon be forced to fight once again. While this may be unexpected, we will not be caught by surprise. We will immediately reinforce our most important fortresses, expand our defenses, and mobilize our reserves. If all goes as planned, we will also be able to rely on assistance from other nations, and possibly even have our allies join the war. However, we could just as well be forced to fight as an island in a sea of enemies. We can only pray for our victory..."

#Imperialism
DEN_focus_danish_imperialism: "Danish Imperialism"
DEN_focus_danish_imperialism_desc: "The history of Danish imperialism reaches back to the 16th century, and in some ways even beyond that. At its largest extent, the Danish empire spanned from the northern Baltics over Scania, in what today is southern Sweden, through Denmark proper, Norway, Iceland, and Greenland, with colonial possession across the Caribbean, Africa, and India. Whilst today only a fraction of the former possessions remain under Danish control, our imperial heritage is still visible, and with the right set of shrewd policies could see a revival of our former glory."

DEN_focus_schleswig_holstein_question_desc: "The Schleswig-Holstein question concerns the legal and political status of the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein to the south of Denmark proper. For decades now, the question whether these multi-ethnic territories should remain in personal union under Denmark despite their large German-speaking communities has been keeping the diplomats of the Great powers busy. We must choose whether we want to attempt a closer integration of the Duchies and risk a war with the German Confederation, or whether we want to do everything in our power to preserve the status quo."

Though many now may not fully understand the scale in which we have achieved victory, our retainment of Schleswig will be seen as a momentous occasion given enough time. Now it is time to celebrate our great triumph and reappearance on the international stage, not as a bygone relic of the past, but as a contender, or even player, in modern politics."

Now more than ever the Danish spirit is alive, and so we must turn our attentions to bolstering support for our cause within the Rigsdagen.

Although we've offered Holstein as an olive branch, it would be foolish to mistake their acceptance for submission. It's clear that until their power struggle boils over to the rest of Europe, they will keep eyeing their neighbours in hopes of gaining an advantage over one another. As such, we must ensure that both our nation and her forces are well prepared for such an eventuality.

Our industry, too, has been suffering as a result of military prioritization. Now that we have achieved peace, we must work to return to a peace-time economy. The first steps will be accomplished through the demobilization of the armed forces, however, we must not be too hasty in doing so.

This war has not only cost us dearly materially, but psychologically too. The psyche of our nation has been thoroughly crushed, and now we have a long and arduous journey ahead of us in the path to recovery, both economically and psychologically."
DEN_focus_demobilization_defeat: "Demobilization"
DEN_focus_demobilization_defeat_desc: "With neither a glory nor victory to show for, our military has proven to be inadequate in the recent war. Keeping the industry and manpower mobilized would prove disastrous for our economy, so it's best we lay down our arms in hopes of some semblance of recovery. We have lost and our forces have returned beaten and shamed, let's hope we can quietly sweep this failure under the proverbial rug by demobilizing quickly and discretely."
DEN_focus_build_esbjerg_port_defeat: "Build the Esbjerg Port"
DEN_focus_build_esbjerg_port_defeat_desc: "Recent developments mean that our previous port at the North Sea, Altona, is no longer an option as our main port in the west. Instead, we will develop a new port in Esbjerg to act as a hub for our ships, and for those importing goods from Great Britain and further west. Most likely, it will also be a primary location for our fishing fleets which is only natural as they are an essential part of our economy."
DEN_focus_denmark_looks_towards_the_future: "Denmark Looks Towards the Future"
DEN_focus_denmark_looks_towards_the_future_desc: "With the parliament practically turned upside down, our new political agenda may finally do us some good. With the loss of both Schleswig and Holstein, our nation has been reminded that Denmark no longer holds war as a viable diplomatic strategy, and that our nation is subject to the whim of the great powers at our doorsteps, be they German, English, French, or Russian. Thus, we must ensure that the world knows that Denmark will not seek to fight as a means of diplomacy anymore, and that Denmark will remain in the quiet sideline in hopes of preserving its own national integrity and peace."

#Country Leader Descriptions
DEN_CARL_CHRISTOFFER_GEORG_ANDRAE_LEADER_DESC: "Carl Christopher Georg Andræ is the President of Denmark and the leader of the Cabinet of Andræ. From 1842 until 1854, he was a professor of mathematics and mechanics at the national military college. During his tenure as professor, he was royally appointed as a member of the 1848 Danish Constituent Assembly, and six years later, became Finance Minister in the Cabinet of Bang. He was appointed President of Denmark in 1856 but although he was trying to appease both the left and the right, his reign unfortunately hasn't been one of peace and calm, as tensions continue to rise in Schleswig and Holstein even after the conclusion of the First Schleswig War. Due to the tiring political turf war, his days as president seem numbered, and it has become semi-public knowledge within political circles that Andræ is considering retirement from his position."
DEN_CARL_CHRISTIAN_HALL_LEADER_DESC: "Carl Christian Hall is a Danish national liberal statesman. He had a distinguished tenure at school and college, after which he became a professor of law. His first steps in politics was when Hall had taken office in the Bang administration on the 12th of December 1854. He's since grown quite a reputation as a politician and, as of now, he has been appointed President of Denmark. With rising tensions around the Schleswig-Holstein question, Hall has been a strong supporter of the Ejderpolitikken policy, which aims to restore Denmark's historic southern border on the Eider river, which runs between Schleswig and Holstein. Hall shares this belief with most of the national liberals, who aim to tie the Duchy of Schleswig more firmly to Denmark, even if it means confrontation with the German Confederation."
DEN_CHRISTIAN_EMIL_FRIJS_LEADER_DESC: "Christian Emil Frijs is a Danish politician that is currently the President of Denmark, heading the Frijs Cabinet. He graduated from Sorø Academy in 1835, going on to study law. He is the wealthiest large squire of Denmark and is honored by his peasants. He is part of the Højre, also known as the Conservative Party and is actively against the National Liberals. Noticing the tensions around Schleswig-Holstein, Frijs so far has decided to oppose the Ejderpolitikken policy in favor of maintaining the status-quo."

HLS_idea_profits_from_altona_1_desc: "Even though both of them are Hansa Cities and they have some kind of alliance, our two neighbours, Hamburg and Lübeck are fierce rivals in trading.

HLS_idea_profits_from_altona_2: "Profits from Altona Port"
HLS_idea_profits_from_altona_2_desc: "Altona is a city on our southern border, the Elbe, bordering Hamburg. As such, most of the goods transported to there have to pass the Altona port, which leads to us profiting due to the tolls that have to be paid. This situation caused and causes difficulties in the relationship between Holstein and the Danish King with Hamburg, which is a good trade partners."
SCH_idea_ethnic_conflicts: "Major German Population"
SCH_idea_ethnic_conflicts_desc: "The Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein consists of the two parts Schleswig and Holstein. Holstein is the part that harbors the German population in Schleswig-Holstein, leading to a conflict with the Danish-populated Schleswig, which Denmark wants to align to Denmark proper, but cannot because of the London Protocol, which forbids any split of the Duchy. The German population in Schleswig-Holstein is also interesting for the German Confederation, in which various factions want to integrate those German-speaking parts into it, again, leading to conflict with Denmark, which also has claims on our region. This complicated situation means that tensions between the Germans and Denmark are tense and could escalate any second..."
SCH_idea_ethnic_conflicts_DEN: "Major Danish Population"
SCH_idea_ethnic_conflicts_DEN_desc: "The Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein consists of the two parts Schleswig and Holstein. Schleswig is the part that is populated by the Danish, which results in the Danish attempts of integrating Schleswig into the Danish state. Unfortunately, the London Protocol, which drew the war in Schleswig-Holstein to a close in 1852, forbid Denmark to take such steps again, stating that Schleswig and it's German-speaking counterpart, Holstein are inseperable and shall be only ruled seperately from Denmark proper. Only time may tell if Denmark is willing to follow the regulations set by the London Protocol or if they will want to pursue the path of integrating Schleswig into Denmark..." 
DEN_SCH_no_request_forces: "Due to the limitations of the §YLondon Protocol of 1852§!, Denmark is not allowed to request forces from Schleswig and Holstein, as the duchies have to be administered as a separate entity outside §Y[DEN.GetNameDef]§!."
