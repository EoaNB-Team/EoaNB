###Focuses###
 SWE_economy: "The Swedish Economy"
 SWE_economy_desc: "Economics is the art to meet unlimited needs with scarce resources, and studying it is the root of all prosperity. We need to address the issues facing our country not just from abroad, but from home as well."
 SWE_not_agrarian_anymore: "Begin Nationwide Industrialization"
 SWE_not_agrarian_anymore_desc: ""
 SWE_develop_oslo: "Develop Oslo"
 SWE_develop_oslo_desc: "Oslo is one of the newer acquisitions of our great homeland, joining us following the Swedish-Norwegian War of 1814. We should focus our efforts on improving Norway, let's think of it as a warm welcome into the Swedish Fatherland"
 SWE_tt_develop_oslo: "\n§RThis path is only useful for people with the Together for Victory DLC§!"
 SWE_develop_gothenburg: "Develop Gothenburg"
 SWE_develop_gothenburg_desc: "Gothenburg is an old and proud city and the largest port in Scandinavia. Originally founded as a Trading Colony for the Dutch, it has grown into the second-largest city in Sweden, and become economically irreplaceable. Focusing our efforts on developing Gothenburg is a very sensible choice."
 SWE_develop_karlskrona: "Develop Karlskrona"
 SWE_develop_karlskrona_desc: "Karlskrona is a small city, but its strategic and historical importance is incalculable. It is the main base of the Royal Swedish Navy, and the Base of Operations for the Coast Guard. It has an exceptionally well-sheltered location: arcs of islands provide a strong defence not only from the sea but also from land attacks. Developing it is, at least as far as the Navy is concerned, a no-brainer."
 SWE_develop_stockholm: "Develop Stockholm"
 SWE_develop_stockholm_desc: "Stockholm is the largest city in Scandinavia and the Capital of Sweden. That's all that needs to be said. Developing Stockholm is as obvious as it gets."
 SWE_nor_fish: "Tax Cuts for Fisheries"
 SWE_nor_fish_desc: "It has been said that fishing is the lifeblood of nations, and we would be foolish to not fully exploit our vast natural resources just off our coast. We should dedicate at least a few weeks to trying to strengthen our Fishing Industry, it could prove very worthwhile!"
 SWE_got_inf: "Fund Infrastructural Development"
 SWE_got_inf_desc: "Infrastructure may not be a very interesting thing to invest money in, but it is plainly necessary for a Modern Nation to function efficiently. Gothenburg's infrastructure should be expanded to keep up with the rapid growth of the city."
 SWE_got_ports: "Expansion of Gothenburg Harbour"
 SWE_got_ports_desc: "Gothenburg may have the largest port in Scandinavia, but is there ever truly such a thing as \"large enough\"? I don't think so! More ports, more Dockyards, Gothenburg will need to expand to keep up with the demands of the Modern world!"
 SWE_got_docks: "Municipalise Gothenburg's Dockyards"
 SWE_got_docks_desc: "Dockyards, Ports, Dry Docks, Wharves, we need all of them! Gothenburg is the perfect candidate for an expansion of our shipbuilding capabilities, an expansion which is long overdue."
 SWE_eu_trade: "Formalise Great Power Trade Treaties"
 SWE_eu_trade_desc: "Trade is the mother of money. We have timber, iron, steel, and a large quantity of rare elements such as gold and tungsten, all of which are in great demand throughout the continent. Establishing official trade relations with the European Great Powers could prove extremely beneficial for our economy."
 SWE_got_convoys: "Purchase Foreign Shipping"
 SWE_got_convoys_desc: "If we are to commit heavily to trade, we need something to move all the exports and imports with. Convoys that is. We can use some time and money to get more convoys, through requisitioning, upgrading, and purchasing."
 SWE_got_yacht_club: "Cooperate with Amateur Sailors"
 SWE_got_yacht_club_desc: "Never underestimate the value of amateurs! These people have a passion for sailing and the ocean, each and everyone has spent thousands of hours out on the seas, they know what they're talking about, and it would be very wise to try to integrate their experience into the Navy."
 SWE_ocean_fleet: "An Atlantic-based Navy"
 SWE_ocean_fleet_desc: "Ever since Norway joined our homeland, we've been faced by the new issue of the Atlantic. Through most of our history, our Navy has been strictly confined to the Baltic Sea but, now, to protect our far larger coast, we need to expand it to be able to operate in the Atlantic as well."
 SWE_karl_coal: "Incentivise Coal Mining Investments"
 SWE_karl_coal_desc: "Coal is horrendously important in the days of modern industries, and we should put an effort into expanding our coal mines, Scania, in particular, has a few good potential spots"
 SWE_karl_inf: "Expand Scanian Railways"
 SWE_karl_inf_desc: "Having good roads is never a bad thing, but some places require them more than others and situated at the very southern tip of our nation, Scania, in particular, could benefit from some Infrastructural upgrades"
 SWE_karl_civ_factory: "Agricultural Mechanization"
 SWE_karl_civ_factory_desc: "Fruitful as our lands are, and as diligent our farmers and fieldworkers may be, the limitations of manual labour are restricting the potential gains our lands can muster! By introducing tractors and new agricultural machinery, the output of our fertile farming fields can increase substantially!"
 SWE_baltic_trade: "Formalise Nordic Trade Treaties"
 SWE_baltic_trade_desc: "Trade is a very important aspect of our economy, and the overwhelming majority of our exports go across the Baltic straight to our ol' neighbours. We have so many old trade treaties that we never bothered to renew, and all manner of new ones that we just never got around to formalising. Why not spend the money to hire a few extra bureaucrats to take care of all the paperwork so we can increase trade? We'll make back the money tenfold!"
 SWE_karl_logging: "Exploit Smalandian Forests"
 SWE_karl_logging_desc: "The dense forests of Småland have a long history of lumbering and forestry, providing much sturdy oak for houses and ships alike! These forests have provided much for Sweden, but the recent mechanization of equipment has allowed for further gains. An expansion of our activities is now in order, with ever more lumber available for our usage!"
 SWE_karl_mil_factory: "Revive Defunct Arms Industries"
 SWE_karl_mil_factory_desc: "The southern tip of Sweden has a long history of arms-producing, but many factories of said arms have been forced to close down in the recent decades following the outbreak of peace. But if you want peace, prepare for war! We should bring these arms factories back by giving them new, alluring, government contracts."

 SWE_naval_tactics: "New Naval Tactics"
 SWE_naval_tactics_desc: "While Sweden's historical naval exploits have been of mixed success, the chance at betterment is always available! Naval combat has changed much since the times of Napoleon; with new weapons, equipment, and strong armoured warships there is much new to learn and adapt for a new dawn of naval warfare!"
 SWE_focus_on_home_fleet: "Focus On Home Fleet"
 SWE_focus_on_home_fleet_desc: "The Home Fleet is the strongest force at the Swedish Navy's command. If we are to project our strength against any other power on the seas that would do us harm, then this fleet must be able to respond and destroy any such foe! In this regard, the Home Fleet must be strengthened and resource priority must go to this fleet!"

 SWE_repay_loan: "Repay loan to Mecklenburg"
 SWE_repay_loan_desc: "We will rapay the loan of 1,258,000 Riksdaler to Mecklenburg that we loaned in 1803. Since then Mecklenburg have keept Wismar until we have repayed the loan it's time to pay it back and get Wismar back!"
 SWE_colonial_ambition: "Colonial Ambitions"
 SWE_colonial_ambition_desc: "Swedish colonial ambitions have been as old as the other large colonial powers, but its history has been fraught by the foreign obstruction; British and French raids on Swedish colonial possessions and other losses have strongly limited Swedish colonial interests since the 1600's! However, a new chance at a colonial empire has come with the African Continent. Our intentions and claims on this land for our benefit should be laid..."
 SWE_negotiate_with_african_kingdoms: "Negotiate with African Kingdoms"

 SWE_negotiation_with_afr_kingdom_fail: "§YSwedish-African Company§! branch negotiations are §Runsuccessful§!"
 SWE_SAC: "Invest in the Swedish African Company"
 SWE_SAC_desc: "After claiming large amounts of land our colony on the gold cost it would be easier to do similar to the British and have someone that controls only our colony. We will let Carl Rudolf Cederström take control of the development of the colony and the Swedish African Company army to protect its lands from the tribal neighbours."

 SWE_focus_branch_not_finished_tooltip: "§RThis branch is not finished.§!"
 
 SWE_fleet_infrastructure: "Expand Fleet Infrastructure"
 SWE_fleet_infrastructure_desc: "Increased activity on the sea, be it close by or far-flung, must be supported by proper naval infrastructure and supply lines. In this effort, we must both enlargen our current naval ports and build new ones as well. Be it the far shores of East Asia or in the heartland of Stockholm Bay, our ships shall sail knowing their fleet is well supplied and ready!"
 SWE_lagos_port: "Colonise Lagos"
 SWE_lagos_port_desc: "Other colonial powers have either recently or for long acquired ports on the West African Coast, purchasing these port areas from local rulers or forcibly taking them by the strength of arms. Even the Danes have a port there! This cannot stand. If Sweden is to be a colonial power, it is critical that we move to secure a naval port of our own in the area. The Bay of Lagos, discovered and named by the Portuguese, should provide an excellent starting base for our future ambitions."
 SWE_expand_inland: "Further Colonisation"
 SWE_expand_inland_desc: "Having claimed Lagos for our own, we must now make use of the foothold that we've acquired to push further into or along Africa. Pushing northwards would allow for more breathing room to work with, and would add more land to explore potential gains in."
 SWE_keep_one_port: "Expand The Port In Lagos"
 SWE_keep_one_port_desc: "While having a port to receive supplies in is good, the capacity that Lagos Port can maintain now has proved unsatisfactory for our needs and plans. The port should be expanded to allow greater inflow of supplies, and larger drydocks to allow for repairs to our warships in the area if needed."

 SWE_reform_navy: "Navy Reforms"
 SWE_reform_navy_desc: "The industrial world that is unfolding before our eyes has given rise to a new kind of naval warfare. Numbered are the days of the wooden sailship, and coming are the days of armoured steamships! Our current naval command and naval assets are ill-adapted to this quickly approaching reality, and an effort to reform and strengthen our navy must be undertaken!"
 SWE_new_ships: "Develop New Ship Models"
 SWE_new_ships_desc: "Introduction of new construction methods which allows for stronger and heavier ships to be built. News of ironclad warships become more frequent over the years, and this trend is only growing stronger. If we are to remain a modern naval power, new ship classes have to be designed and built for the Navy!"
 SWE_new_naval_tactics: "Naval Exercises"
 SWE_new_naval_tactics_desc: "Having gained an extensive coastline, stretching from Umeå to Kirkenes, fraught with fjords and rocky archipelagos along the coast, it is imperative to exercise in this geography. From the frostridden but calm seas of the Baltic to the wild and mobile seas of the North Atlantic, we must sail and be able to effectively engage any foe in battle!"
 SWE_new_ports: "Shipyards in Gotland"
 SWE_new_ports_desc: "Although our primary source of shipping comes from the naval yards of Stockholm and Karlskrona, the Island of Gotland and its port city of Visby has shown some promise for naval production. Being an old trade hub for trade across the Baltic Sea, Visby has a long and old tradition in seafaring, and should make an excellent addition to our maritime construction efforts."
 SWE_new_docks: "Expand Naval Production"
 SWE_new_docks_desc: "Where ever it is possible, we should continue to expand our shipping industry to a greater capacity. If not for wartime usage, it is highly beneficial for our civilian sector to maintain a high ship output."

 SWE_baltic_fleet: "A Baltic-based Fleet"
 SWE_baltic_fleet_desc: "Since the founding of the Swedish Royal Navy, its primary operational theatre has always been the Baltic Sea. From the great victory in the Battle of Svensksund to the humiliating loss of Vasa, it was always in these seas that the Swedish Navy sailed, fought and died. Since and despite the acquisition of Norway that reality has for the most part not changed, and the Baltic Fleet remains steadfastly the sword and shield of Sweden at sea."
 SWE_nor_ships: "Expand our Atlantic Shipyards"
 SWE_nor_ships_desc: "Since our acquisition of Norway in 1814, we have not properly reviewed the assets that the Norwegian industry currently holds. While this is due to Norwegian stubbornness for self-governance, we can still offer investments for the expansion and development of Atlantic shipyards. Making the effort for such a development would allow us to both increases our shipbuilding capacity, but also increase our grasp on the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea."
 SWE_nor_inf: "Norwegian Mountain Tunnels"
 SWE_nor_inf_desc: "Infrastructure development in Norway has always been hindered by its very mountainous and hilly topography, with most transport of goods being done by sea to bypass going over the tall and rugged hills that make Norway's landscapes. New developments by chemists such as Alfred Nobel has however produced a strong explosive in dynamite that is apt for tunnel digging through Norway's mountains. Such work would allow for railways and roads to spread across Norway unhindered by natural terrain, making it a beneficial effort!"
 SWE_nor_scientests: "Mountain Observatories"
 SWE_nor_scientests_desc: "Owing to Norway's mountainous terrain and the great number of bare peaks, the mountains of Norway make for good placements for observatories. From the mountain tops, researchers and scientists can view many cosmic phenomena unfolding over the night sky; be that Aurora Borealis or the many, many twinkling stars above and beyond the heavens of the Earth."
 SWE_swe_factories: "Subsidise new Industries"
 SWE_swe_factories_desc: "Many proposals are sitting on our desks detailing all kinds of projects, from humble upgrades to ambitious new creations. The Industrial Era is taking the rest of the World by storm, we should subsidise some of these plans to try to keep up with everyone else."
 SWE_swe_coal: "Develop the Coal Industry"
 SWE_swe_coal_desc: "There is coal in the hills!\n Coal is the unglamorous hero of the 19th century! It may not shine like gold, or perfectly adorn necklaces like pearls, but it can do something that none of those precious minerals can do, it can power ships and factories! The English have a near-monopoly on coal production, and it would serve us very well if we could become more self-reliant when it came to our energy needs"
 SWE_swe_lumber: "Tax-cuts for Lumbering Companies"
 SWE_swe_lumber_desc: "Like it or not, quid pro quos are the way the world works. We scratch their back and they scratch ours. The forestry industry assures us that they will expand their business, creating more jobs and more exports, ultimately strengthening the economy, if we do a favour for them and cut their taxes."
 SWE_swe_men: "Fund Recruitment Drive"
 SWE_swe_men_desc: "\"You there! Do your duty for King and Fatherland, enlist today! Unless you're a coward, that is?\" \nSpreading some propaganda pamphlets across the cities ought to remind the lower classes of their duty to our Fatherland! This new recruitment drive will doubtlessly drive thousands to the recruitment office. Calling people who don't want to die cowards always work, it's the oldest trick in the book!"
 SWE_army: "Examine the Army"
 SWE_army_desc: "The Royal Swedish Army hasn't been properly maintained since the times of the Finnish War and has been in a poor state ever since. In particular, the logistics of training and armament. To know which improvements the Army would require, we need to identify weaknesses and shortages in both training and weapon usage to enact that training. You cannot reform that which you do not know!"
 SWE_land_focus: "Revise our Doctrines"
 SWE_land_focus_desc: "Sweden has had since the times of the House of Vasa a first-rate military. What Sweden lacked in numerical strength, she made up for ineffective tactics and superior weaponry. Recently, however, our dedication to that legacy has been lacking! The world has moved on from the giant that was Napoleon, and we must follow suit if we want to remain a modern army!\n\nThe question is, where should we go?"
 SWE_look_to_past: "Look to the Past"
 SWE_look_to_past_desc: "The exploits of the old warrior-kings of Sweden should be our inspiration to develop our new doctrines! The brilliant shock tactics by Karl XII and his stalwart Caroleans that broke the Russian titan at Narva and the effective usage of mobile cannon fire by Gustav II Vasa was ahead of its time, and will continue to be into the future! We need not look further, the past commanders know it to be true!"
 SWE_look_to_future: "Look to the Future"
 SWE_look_to_future_desc: "While Sweden has a long and prestigious military history, we must not forget that Sweden was victorious on the field then by looking forwards and adapting! Developments in Prussia, France, and the US have shown new resources to use in war, in the form of the telegraph and railroad, to quickly adjust, manoeuvre and outmanoeuvre an opponent. This warfare has proven very viable, even critical, to success and must as such be adopted into our new doctrines!"
 SWE_learn_from_prussians: "Learn from the Prussians"
 SWE_learn_from_prussians_desc: "The Kingdom of Prussia, the "Army with a State", is famous for its military traditions and its effective soldiers. Their military command structure is famed for its effectiveness and remarkable flexibility to respond to an enemy, emphasizing rapid advance to obstruct and defeat slower opponents. In the past, this would be an ample fit for our movement-based fighting, but our primary objective is now defensive in nature. Should we follow the Prussians?"
 SWE_learn_from_frenchies: "Learn from the French"
 SWE_learn_from_frenchies_desc: "Sweden has many ties with France, especially after the Napoleonic Wars where Karl Johan was instated as ruling king in Sweden. More importantly, however, is their doctrines and its focus on defensive warfare. Emphasizing strong esprit de corps and élan to hold together when facing an enemy and holding beneficial defensive advantages on the field makes French thinking fitting for our situation. There are however some murmurs that sitting still and expecting the enemy to attack throws away the initiative to the enemy. Should we follow France?"
 SWE_buy_french_guns: "Buy French Equipment"
 SWE_buy_french_guns_desc: "France and its arsenals produce fine and efficient weapons, and do so in great quantity. In this time of European peace, they should have great weapon stockpiles they have no use for. Perhaps the French would be kind enough to let us purchase some of these weapons for our use from their stocks?"
 SWE_invite_retired_officers: "Invite Retired Prussian Officers"
 SWE_invite_retired_officers_desc: "If we are to adopt the method of Prussian warfare, then we must have more than third-hand accounts and manuals. We must have the people that have the experience and knowledge of the practical application of this type of warfare. Inviting retired officers and servicemen from the Prussian Army to discuss and teach these methods would allow for better understanding and application of this new way of thinking for us."
 SWE_germanize_army: "Germanize the Army"
 SWE_germanize_army_desc: "If we are to follow Prussian example, then it would perhaps be wise to adopt its traditions, style, and weapon choices. Doing this would allow us to more effectively emulate the Prussian style of warfare, but would also be a love letter to the Prussians. As they say:0 "There is no greater flattery than imitation"!"
 SWE_regimental_exercises: "Invite French Regiments to Military Exercises"
 SWE_regimental_exercises_desc: "Having following along French thinking for a time, our officers feel that practical field exercises are needed to expand our understanding of French defensive warfare. A suggestion to invite French Army regiments to local army exercises in defensive tactics seems to be the way forwards if we want to improve. Inviting France would both give us the experience we need, but would also allow for favourable connections to form between both our armies."
 SWE_denounce_danes: "Denounce the Danes"
 SWE_denounce_danes_desc: "Denmark. Sweden's oldest rival and enemy throughout its history. We have fought many, many wars between each other for influence and domination in the North, Denmark being a constant thorn in Swedens side. Our relations have been for the most part cordial and friendly for the past decades, but that does not mean that the rivalry has been forgotten. We should make that very clear to the Danes."
 SWE_french_treaty: "Sign a Treaty with France"
 SWE_french_treaty_desc: "To further our relations and possible military exchanges, it has been suggested that we write and sign a treaty of friendship and cooperation with France. The treaty would contain stipulations on relations and obligations, and perhaps forward interests of trade and commerce as well."
 SWE_foreign_advisers: "Integrate Foreign Advisors"
 SWE_foreign_advisers_desc: "Military advisors from foreign nations bring both new insights and news from each of their nations military developments, exploits, and innovations, and are also often experienced military men with much campaigning and planning under their belts. Making use of that experience as an integrated contingent within our command structures and direct command units would allow for that experience to be applied directly, and would bring more benefits besides only teaching what they know."
 SWE_lifeguard: "Deploy the Life Regiments!"
 SWE_lifeguard_desc: "Since the Liberation War of the 1500s, the Life Regiments have been the personal lifeguard of the King. Being owned, and therefore financed, by the wealthiest aristocrat in the Kingdom, they were traditionally better trained and equipped than their provincial counterparts. Though the centralisation of recent years mean that all regiments are owned and financed by the state, these regiments are still considered to be the more prestigious units in the Swedish Army and are often personally commanded by the King in battle. Now more than ever, we need these units to enter the fray. With some... Gentle persuasion, we might be able to convince the King to resign his command and appoint a far more competent Colonel in his stead. The Second-in-Command of the Life Regiment Hussars, Carl Herman Leuheusen, is a popular candidate"
 SWE_traditionalism: "Traditionalism"
 SWE_traditionalism_desc: "While the world constantly moves into the future, one must not forget their roots and traditions lest one'll be swept from their feet in confusion! Tradition brings both security and stability, as you are surrounded by what is both common and familiar tendencies and behaviour expected by your fellow Swede. Strong traditions keep the people close and the culture alive, and that is a central pillar of the nation that must not weaken!"
 SWE_Secure_Vote_CON: "Secure the Vote"
 SWE_Secure_Vote_CON_desc: "In the coming election an effort must be made to gather up as many votes and support as possible! As is in the nature of the position we find ourselves politically, an emphasis on the strength of the people and their traditions will be made. Tradition and culture will keep the nation together and stable to face every challenge the future may hold, and maintain a strong national identity. Holding together, the nation will never falter!"
 SWE_Magnate_Gifts: "\"Gift\" the Magnates"
 SWE_Magnate_Gifts_desc: "The magnates of Sweden, the landowners, and wealthy business profiles, are important figures to keep in touch with regardless of political position. By providing them with certain advantages and charters in exchange for support and funding, we can smoothen relations between them and us in the upcoming election."
 SWE_Fearmonger_CON: "Fearmonger about the Economy"
 SWE_Fearmonger_CON_desc: ""The economy is failing! The stocks will fall, and we will all be poor if nothing changes!" - These statements might not be exactly accurate, right now that is, but it stokes insecurity and anxiety in the people about the current state of things! And making a change, preferably changing to our party, becomes even more important and rapidly needed than before!"
 SWE_Manipulation_CON: "Manipulate the Poor"
 SWE_Manipulation_CON_desc: "The poor of the nation are always the ones that are affected the most when emergencies or crises occur and are also thus one of the classes of people that are easier to influence and manipulate. The poor will often cling to what they have dearly, and stoking fear of loss to their already miserable finances or assets is an effective way to, if not vote for us, vote for someone that is not our opponents."
 SWE_Endorsement_CON: "Get the Endorsement of Paramilitary Groups"
 SWE_Endorsement_CON_desc: ""
 SWE_Slander_CON: "Slander the Opposition"
 SWE_Slander_CON_desc: ""The primary candidate of the opposition is a raving hypocrite who robs the poor and drowns them in debt!" - Slander and "mudslinging" are common tactics in politics to derail and throw off opponents in both debate and their legitimacy as a worthy party. While one or two claims can be debunked, a whole barrage of accusations, denunciations, and rumours can make even the most appealing candidate unsavoury in the eyes of the public."
 SWE_polls_CON: "To the Polls!"
 SWE_polls_CON_desc: "We have done much to improve our position or at least worsen the position of the opposition, in the upcoming election. Now it is time to see if our efforts have been worth it, or if it's been in vain. To the polls!"
 SWE_new_government: "New Government"
 SWE_new_government_desc: "With the new members selected for office, we must now establish our new government! We will take the time to select where and which member will go, based on their preferences, abilities... and favours granted."
 SWE_new_government_CON: "Establish the new Government"
 SWE_new_government_CON_desc: "With elections over, it's time to build a new government based on the choices of the people and within the party. Selecting the ablest and willing to the right office will take a bit of time, but we should shortly have a new government up and going."
 SWE_strengthen_government_CON: "Strengthen the new Government"
 SWE_strengthen_government_CON_desc: "While we were victorious in the election due to a good campaign gone well, we still have both critics and other parties to deal with in-house. To strengthen the government's position, some moves against them have to be taken. If that implies removing them, or compromising on our election goals remains to be seen..."
 SWE_purge_liberals_CON: "Purge the Liberals"
 SWE_purge_liberals_CON_desc: "The Liberals are unwilling to cooperate with our goals, policies or wishes, and it has thus been decided that the best course of action is to remove them from the political scene! Anyone opposing the new government will be weeded out using blackmail, force or other means. We cannot have any roadblocks hinder our goals!"
 SWE_Compromise_liberals_CON: "Compromise with the Liberals"
 SWE_Compromise_liberals_CON_desc: "While we may have our disagreements with the ideas and stances of our Liberal opponents, it may be wiser to cooperate with them instead of obstructing them. By negotiating some compromises between us on the new government's policies and goals, we can get some of our goals done free of obstruction from rival political parties."
 SWE_Cronyism_CON: "Cronyistic Cabinet"
 SWE_Cronyism_CON_desc: "Politics based on relationship over merit can be both detrimental or beneficial, depending on how one observes it. By inviting friends, and friends of friends into the cabinet only, we will have a government that can pass legislative measures with great ease due to friendly relationships. However, inviting people to take a position based only on the relationship and not proven competency tends to make an inefficient government."
 SWE_Meritocracy_CON: "Meritocratic Cabinet"
 SWE_Meritocracy_CON_desc: "A meritocratic cabinet will emphasize the competency of the individuals taking up a position, and as such implements laws and regulations go much easier and more efficiently. However, not all cabinet members may agree with all proposals we have, and even oppose them at worst. This can make passing certain policies difficult, but if done, will be done efficiently."
 SWE_Legislative_CON: "Pursue our Legislative Agenda"
 SWE_Legislative_CON_desc: "Our goals as promised during our campaign to the people for the election must be fulfilled, at least somewhat partially, if we are to be a party worth our salt! We will move to secure our agenda goals, and attempt to fulfill as many as possible before the term is up."
 SWE_Social_CON: "Address Social Issues"
 SWE_Social_CON_desc: "An important issue for our time is the state of our people. There are many who are poor and exploited, many health hazards and illnesses claim an unneeded amount of lives, the state of education and work, and more are just scratching the surface of potential issues in the topic. These are problems that many faces, and as such need to be addressed to some degree by the government to its people."
 SWE_no_voting_poor_CON: "Take away Voting Rights from the Poor"
 SWE_no_voting_poor_CON_desc: "The poor have no business having the right to vote on government elections! The lack of an informed opinion on complicated topics and generally low education levels among the poor is a detriment to the democratic process, and makes the poor some of the easiest people to mislead with falsehoods and conjecture! No more! We shall have that blight on democracy removed regardless of protest!"
 SWE_no_voting_women_CON: "Arrest Suffragettes"
 SWE_no_voting_women_CON_desc: "Women advocating equality in-laws, work and love, or "Suffragettes" as they are called, are a nuisance to Swedish society that plagues it wherever they appear. Their obstruction of the current order and their persistent requests for equality is a threat to stability, normalcy, and order in Sweden and as such must be stopped. Their protests will now be outlawed."
 SWE_no_pensions_for_veterans_CON: "No Pensions for Veterans"
 SWE_no_pensions_for_veterans_CON_desc: "While the veterans of Sweden deserve respect and admiration for their service and commitment to defend Sweden from threats both inside and outside its borders, it has become apparent that their allowances cannot be supported further by the state. The finances that are allotted to their pensions are greatly needed to more important projects and purposes, and as such must sadly be taken by closing off veteran pensions."
 SWE_why_does_everyone_hate_us_CON: "Our Internal Unpopularity" #You can tell the person (I assume it's Jen) writing the focus tree doesn't like conservatives lol
 SWE_why_does_everyone_hate_us_CON_desc: "It would seem that the policies that we have implemented over the last years have caused quite a bit of outrage among the people of Sweden. Some speculate that it may have to do with the restriction of basic liberties for the biggest group of people in the nation suddenly for trivial reasons, but it is still not clear."
 SWE_Economy_CON: "See to the Economy"
 SWE_Economy_CON_desc: "Putting other issues aside, for now, we should examine the state of the Swedish economy. Booms in the lumber sector and other affiliated industries seems to be a rising strongpoint in the economy. Besides other traditionally strong sectors of the economy, such as steel and mineral mining, we should look to what else can be done to better optimize our economic prospects."
 SWE_kill_gripenstedt_CON: "Get rid of Gripenstedt"
 SWE_kill_gripenstedt_CON_desc: "Gripenstedt has become a nuisance for our intents to create a policy more in-line with our goals. His meddling is undesirable... and we should give serious consideration to remove him from having any say in the matter."
 SWE_reconcile_gripenstedt_CON: "Reconcile with Gripenstedt"

 SWE_accept_capitalism_CON_desc: "Capitalism is seemingly the model driving forwards economic development today and into the future, despite its somewhat polarizing effects on wealth distribution. Regardless of what one might think of capitalism and its effects on Sweden, it is a model that has taken solid root in our society and economic life. Perhaps there will be better alternatives for the future one day, but today we have no choice but to accept it as our best option."

 SWE_subsidise_new_industries_CON_desc: "We are in the midst of an industrial revolution never before seen in the world, and many new and brilliant ideas and concepts are making an appearance in Sweden as the days go by. While factories have gotten a decisive foothold in the nation, the base is still small. What most would-be industrialists and investors lack has always been investment and capital to start their manufactories. The state, however, can provide for these shortcomings for these promising groups with capital and investment for the development of new factories!"

 SWE_liberalism_desc: "Liberalisation of economic prospects and society, providing freedoms for individuals to make more choices on their own accord without too much regulation can certainly be a boon to the people and economy at large. However, such a path would remove power from the government to make more independent choices as well, which could make a ruling with more power difficult."

 SWE_unite_the_left_desc: "The left side of the Swedish political scene has long disagreed on various topics, goals, and how to achieve them.

This influence would be an invaluable asset when the election comes; should he lead us?"

Undoubtedly the result of the Kingdom having spent several decades attacking everything in sight. As a remedy for this issue Charles XI introduced the Allotment System: By localising finances and streamlining the recruitment process, this new system promised to alleviate the recruitment issue and, combined with various other reforms, modernise the Swedish Army, turning it into a relentless war-machine that would, when next faced with a foreign invasion, spend two decades destroying every enemy army insight. \n\nThe legacy of Charles XI and his caroleans lives on strongly in Sweden, and we should change our Army to reflect what it was 150 years ago: An unstoppable war-machine"

Falling back and letting the enemy overextend their supply lines, all while constantly harassing those very same lines, using baits and traps to lure the enemy deeper and deeper into the country until you can finally close in and annihilate them.

Above all, the soldiers must go-on. They must continue advancing, continue attacking, no matter what.

###Events###
 eoanb_sweden.0.t: "The Kingdom of Sweden-Norway"
 eoanb_sweden.0.d: "The Year is 1857 in the year of our Lord, and the Triple Crowns of the Swedish Kingdom stand at a fork in the road. On one hand, lies the path to greatness and prosperity, and on the other, the road to death and ruin. "
 eoanb_sweden.0.a: "För Kung och Fosterland!"
 
 eoanb_sweden.1.t: "The Municipal Reforms of [GetYear]"
 eoanb_sweden.1.d: "Ever since the 1520s, cities and parishes in Sweden have been ruled to a near-dictatorial extent by mayors undemocratically appointed by the Privy Council in Stockholm. This has been subject to heavy criticism with accusations of corruption, quid pro quos, and partisan bias being ever-present. The heavy-handed approach of many frankly unqualified mayors has resulted in a general feeling of disenfranchisement among the peasantry. Public outcry demanding that mayors be democratically elected and for local parliaments to be established has grown deafening, and many legislators have begun seriously discussing a widespread reform to address these issues. \n\nThe current consensus proposes that parishes are abolished as judicial regions entirely, and that the country should instead be divided into municipalities, the size of which shall be determined by population and area. Each municipality will have its own parliament of democratically elected representatives who are tasked to oversee the day-to-day business of the region. The mayor, in this new system, will see his power significantly curtailed and will serve as little more than a figurehead. \n\nProponents of this reform argue that not only are these changes principally justified in order for our society to be truly free but also that it will decrease corruption and, with power distributed among many people rather than one, will result in a more competent administration. By abolishing parishes we would also take steps in the direction of secularization, where competency is higher valued than your ability to cite scripture, the argument goes. \n\nOpponents cite tradition, arguing that it is wildly disrespectful to go against three centuries of heritage because some peasants feel repressed. With power based on local elections rather than government appointments, this also stands to challenge the more authoritarian minded within our society."
 eoanb_sweden.1.a: "The peasants are acting like spoiled children. We'll give them nothing."
 eoanb_sweden.1.b: "The current system is unsustainable, we need these reforms."
 
 eoanb_sweden.2.t: "The Trial of the Six"
 eoanb_sweden.2.d: "Shock and scandal are rocking the country following a very controversial court ruling in the capital. Six women are standing trial for heresy because of their Catholic faith. \n\nThe Kingdom of Sweden has had an extremely strong association with Lutheranism and Protestantism ever since the days of the Thirty Years' War and Gustavus Adolphus the Great, and Catholicism has been forcefully rejected by the nation for hundreds of years. \n\nBut be that as it may, some people argue that the very reason Gustavus Adolphus the Great intervened in the Thirty Years' War in the first place was to protect religious freedom and that the right to believe in any of the numerous interpretations of the Bible and Jesus Christ is the right of every Swedish citizen. The French and Spanish embassies have also made a formal protest to the government over this trial, calling it outrageous and asking the government to consider pardoning the accused. \n\nThe government is facing a difficult call; Pardon the women, and trample all over the legal system, or allow the court to banish them and risk angering the Catholic countries of Europe."
 eoanb_sweden.2.a: "The government has no business interfering in the judicial system."
 eoanb_sweden.2.b: "Religious freedom is non-negotiable."
 
 eoanb_sweden.3.t: "Lumber Boom!"
 eoanb_sweden.3.d: "Wood, wood, wood! This may be a time of steam and steel, but the importance of lumber is perhaps greater than ever before! Luckily for our economy, we got more of it than we could ever use!\n\nThe English, with their seemingly never-ending shipbuilding, are paying ludicrous sums of money for lumber, and it has caused the Swedish timber industry to boom! Across the Kingdom, especially in the mostly unpopulated north, new steam-powered sawmills have begun to spring up in the hundreds.\n\nOur export of lumber is going through the roof and is projected to increase by several hundred per cents in the coming months. Countless workers have found new well-paying, honest jobs in these sawmills.\n\nNot only is this helping to reduce unemployment but the tax revenue we are receiving from these lumber businesses is nothing short of jawdropping.\n\nSome of the companies have started arguing that if they were to receive a tax cut, they could use that money to build even more mills and, in turn, employ even more workers. Doing this would surely upset some radicals, however..."
 eoanb_sweden.3.a: "They deserve a tax cut for their hard work!"
 eoanb_sweden.3.b: "They can afford to pay the same..."
 
 eoanb_sweden.4.t: "Swedish Timber Boom"
 eoanb_sweden.4.d: "In the last few months, Sweden has been experiencing a lumber boom, the economic explosion is impacting the North of the Kingdom very strongly, with hundreds of sawmills being sprung up, employing thousands and paying millions in taxes. The Swedish Economy is thus experiencing a strong revitalisation. This boom has in large part been caused by our massive demand for timber for shipbuilding, and the boom is very good news for Dockyards throughout the country. The massive increase in supply is driving down the cost of wood, and that is, in turn, allowing our dockyards to pump out new ships even quicker."
 eoanb_sweden.4.a: "Very good!"
 
 eoanb_sweden.5.t: "Long live the King"
 eoanb_sweden.5.d: "Earlier today, his Majesty King Oscar I passed away. \n\nHis Majesty has suffered from serious illnesses for the last 30 years, but through pure willpower stayed alive. However, he never truly recovered from the death of his son Prince Gustaf six years ago. Since that traumatic event, he has been suffering severe memory loss, and after a stroke two years ago, he became paralyzed. At the recommendation of his doctor, he stepped down from all public affairs shortly thereafter and appointed Crown Prince Charles to serve as the regent in his stead. After stepping down, it seemed like he was starting to recover, however, around one year ago, his health took a rapid turn for the worse. In the last few months, he has been slipping in and out of consciousness, the once-proud king having been reduced to an incoherent, shivering wreck. \n\nYesterday evening, his condition became critical, and his family quickly travelled to the Royal Palace to say their farewells. The autopsy revealed an egg-sized tumour in his brain, which is the likely cause of death. \n\nThough his passing has not come as a great shock, it is regardless a great tragedy, and the country is in mourning. \n\nCrown Prince Charles has assumed the official position of King of Sweden, and his coronation is scheduled for May next year."
 eoanb_sweden.5.a: "May he Rest in Peace."
 
 eoanb_sweden.6.t: "The S.W.A.F.D is founded!"
 eoanb_sweden.6.d: "The Swedish Women's Association for the Fatherlands Defense, or SWAFD for short, was founded earlier today in Stockholm. The association, with aims to start a grassroots movement to encourage patriotism and support for the Armed Forces, has already started the process of raising several hundred-thousand crowns to support the Army through lotteries and donations. \nIt's chairman, Lady Lotta von Plomgren, impassionately pleaded to the \"Daughters of the Fatherland to support its Defenders!\" in the Church of St. Nicholas in one of the numerous events to support the Army. \n\nThough some members of the Military feel bitter about receiving help from the lesser sex, there is no denying that the extra money and grassroots support will prove invaluable, both in terms of financing expansions, and finding new personnel."
 eoanb_sweden.6.a: "We are United in our struggle"
 eoanb_sweden.6.b: "Our Army needs no help"
 
 eoanb_sweden.7.t: "The Bessemer Process reaches Sweden!"
 eoanb_sweden.7.d: "The Bessemer process, named after its inventor, Henry Bessemer, has finally started to gain traction in Sweden! \n\nThe process, which uses oxidation and other chemical reactions to make high-quality steel from cheap pig iron, has the potential to enable, for the first time in history, the ability to mass-produce steel relatively cheaply. \n\nThough experiments with the process were initially unsuccessful in Sweden, businessman Pontus Kleman and metallurgical engineer Johan Leffler have managed to create the first successful ironworks which utilizes the process. Though this is revolutionary, it is still met with some scepticism from larger ironworks who argue that this is alchemy and chrysopoeia all over again."
 eoanb_sweden.7.a: "Very impressive!"
 
 eoanb_sweden.8.t: "Louis de Geer enters the Stage"
 eoanb_sweden.8.d: "After much deliberation, His Majesty the King has appointed Louis Gerard De Geer av Finspång as the new Prime Minister of Sweden. Though the Conservatives hold control of both chambers of Parliament, with this appointment, the Liberals now have a fairly alarming amount of control over the country, occupying both the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance, and, the Government as a whole. \n\nDe Geer was initially offered the post two years ago, but seeing how meteoric his career so far had been, he politely declined, waiting until he was more established in political circles before assuming such a prestigious office. \n\nWe can do nought but speculate about what the future holds for de Geer, but, he is wildly recognised as an excellent statesman and politician, and political experts predict that his appointment forebodes a time of change for Sweden, for better or worse."
 eoanb_sweden.8.a: "Welcome to the Government, de Geer"
 eoanb_sweden.8.b: "We must do everything to reverse this appointment"
 
 eoanb_sweden.9.t: "The Election"
 eoanb_sweden.9.d: "Following the election, the final tallies are in! Completely reversing the Conservative Status quo, Liberal Candidates have won big across the nation, from north to south. Both chambers of parliament now have a liberal majority which can get to work implementing their long-anticipated reforms."
 eoanb_sweden.9.a: "Fantastic news!"
 
 eoanb_sweden.10.t: "The Election"
 eoanb_sweden.10.d: "Following the election, the final tallies are in! Though the Liberals saw some gain, they have failed to overcome the hurdles of the Conservative Establishment. Liberals are still a minority in both chambers of parliament, and it seems unlikely that that will change.\nThe Liberals will have to adopt a new strategy following this decisive failure, but what that strategy will be is still a mystery"
 eoanb_sweden.10.a: "A setback to the Liberals"
 
 eoanb_sweden.11.t: "The March on Stockholm"
 eoanb_sweden.11.d: "It is clear that the institutions of power do not favour the liberal cause! With the loss of the election to our opponents, we have concluded that the only option to save Sweden and its people is by force. We stand with no other choice but to take power for ourselves by way of arms!\n\nWe will march on Stockholm and surround the illegitimate government elected by false means and demand a change of power. The Conservatives may put police in the street and soldiers around the Royal Palace and the Riksdag, but we know our cause to be just and that their opposition will falter to our unyielding will! When we march, we march for the people!\n\nTo arms!"
 eoanb_sweden.11.a: "Stockholm trembles!"
 
 eoanb_sweden.12.t: "The March on Stockholm"
 eoanb_sweden.12.d: "Success!\n\nMarching on the capital at noon, our valiant vanguard managed to break through hastily erected barricades by local police and soldiers in their march towards the Riksdag. Marching on the defenders, the vanguard encountered stiff resistance from the local garrisons and a small exchange of gunfire occurred with injuries and casualties on both sides. Units from other attack points moved down Strömgatan and surrounded the defenders fighting along Drottninggatan, forcing a surrender there. Moving rapidly to secure entry through Vasabron and Strömbron from the north, with other forces loyal to our cause moving to secure the southern end of these critical junction points, the Royal Palace was put at the striking range and the Riksdag surrounded from all sides. With increasing pressure mounting on both sites, a critical breach of Royal Palace defences would decidedly force the government, with reassurance from the King, to concede to our forces.\n\nStockholm is ours, and our cause shining brighter than ever!"
 eoanb_sweden.12.a: "En seger för Sverige!"
 
 eoanb_sweden.13.t: "The Fall of Saint Petersburg"
 eoanb_sweden.13.d: "We have confirmed reports coming in from Saint Petersburg that, after a long day of street fighting, the city has fallen. \n\nAfter having spent several days fighting in the towns and palaces scattering the area surrounding the city, the Russian General Staff made the heavy-hearted decision to abandon the region and retreat to St. Petersburg, with the Swedes in hot pursuit. \n\nMany hours of fighting ensued in the city, as the Russians attempted to stop the Swedish advance, but those attempts failed, and the Swedes, though having suffered horrendous losses, had captured most of the city by six PM. \nThe final battle took place in the Peter and Paul Fortress, a few hundred yards north of the Hermitage. Major General Daragan of the Volinsky Regiment rallied Russian Survivors from all across the city, even going as far as to arm the servants of the castle, anything to stop the Swedish soldiers. After a brief negotiation, however, General Daragan agreed to surrender his forces. The time was four minutes to ten in the evening, St. Petersburg had finally fallen. \n\nThough no one can foresee the future, Military Experts predict that it doesn't bode well for the Russian Empire. \nSome Swedish Militarists, emboldened by the victory, and confidence in their ability to \"restore the Swedish Empire\" have even gone so far as to suggest that St. Petersburg should be renamed into \"Nöteborg\", as it was called before it was captured by Russia in 1704, causing a great many people to roll their eyes"

 eoanb_sweden.13.c: "I want a detailed report before making a decision"
 
 eoanb_sweden.14.t: "The Siege of Saint Petersburg"
 eoanb_sweden.14.d: "After having spent several days fighting in the towns and palaces scattering the area surrounding the city, the Russian General Staff decided to abandon the region and retreat to St. Petersburg, with the Swedes in hot pursuit. \nFollowing the capture of the Nevsky District, Swedish Troops, spearheaded by a detachment of Grenadiers led by Colonel Hägerflycht, made a quick advance north. Though initially slowed down by Skirmish Fire from entrenched troops in several houses on Babushkina street, the Swedish Force eventually reached Bekhtereva Square. The threat of Swedes on their flanks forced Russian Units from all across the Frunzensky district to retreat towards the heart of the city. Despite this, however, their defensive positions in the Tsentralny and Admiralteysky districts soon proved untenable and the Russian Commanders decided to fall back to behind the Fontanka river. The Swedes wasted no time in the chase. \nHeavy fighting in the Field of Mars ensued, almost resembling a conventional line battle as the two opposing sides drew up their formations across the field, however, the Swedes managed to capture the Field of Mars and the Imperial Stables next to them. The Russian Regiments fell back to the Palace Square, forming up around the Alexander Column, determined to stop the Swedes from capturing the Hermitage or the Winter Palace. After the initial Swedish Attack was cut to pieces by concentrated rifle fire from the Hermitage Theatre, Colonel Hägerflycht brought up several artillery pieces to pound the Russian defenders into submission. In what was described as a “regrettable overreaction”  the Swedish Artillery hit the historic St. Isaac’s Cathedral in their barrage and reportedly killed several Priests. However, the artillery did succeed in finally breaking the Russian ramparts, clearing the way for an overwhelming assault, spearheaded by the Life Regiment Grenadiers. The Russian defiance in the Palace Square has been described, even by the Swedes, as \"heroic\", but in the end, the Russian Units in the square were wiped out. \nThe final battle took place in the Peter and Paul Fortress, a few hundred yards north of the Hermitage. Major General Daragan of the Volinsky Regiment rallied Russian Survivors, even going as far as to arm the servants of the castle, anything to stop the Swedish soldiers. Adjutant General Bergenstråhle, the de-facto leader of the assault on the city, met with General Daragan to discuss the terms of the Russian Surrender. Though Daragan has planned to make the last stand he, for the sake of his men, agreed to Bergenstråhle’s terms; The Russian Troops still left in the city would be spared and allowed to return to their homes, as long as they vowed not to take up arms against Sweden again. The time was 10:23 PM, St. Petersburg had finally fallen. \n\nThough no one can foresee the future, Military Experts predict that it doesn't bode well for the Russian Empire. Some Swedish Militarists, emboldened by the victory, have even gone so far as to suggest that St. Petersburg should be renamed into \"Nöteborg\" as it was called before it was captured by Russia in 1704"

The King is willing to support the government's decisions officially, or at least stay neutral on the matters of state during the period of which the new cabinet rules.

 eoanb_sweden.33.d: "While our old and venerable king has little say in matters of practical policy, he remains the ceremonial head of state and representative of what is the ruling order in Sweden. What the king may say, do or prefer is or can be seen as a legitimization of certain ideas and practices. While his influence in government is diminished, his influence on the common man is still a very real tangible thing.\n\nRecently, this influence has become troublesome for our policymaking with the King going so far as to denounce our policies and their effects as being damaging to the Swedish nation and its people. His influence has become a threat, and it grows by the day as more and more hear his words. Forces ready to deal with the king have been put in place, and now all that remains is to make a choice.

While it's hardly a great concern who the king associates with on his free time, it is not this itself but rather the future consequences that are making some government officials worried. \n\nConsidering the King has very little real power in society, it wouldn't take much effort to simply bully him into picking more... appropriate friends.

 eoanb_sweden.38.d: "Åland, a group of small islands that separates the Northern Baltic Sea from the Southern Baltic Sea, has been successfully reclaimed by Swedish efforts!\n\nHaving been lost to Russia during the 1808-1809 Finnish War, Åland has long been occupied and administrated by Russian forces as a province of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The island has a predominantly Swedish-speaking population and has long been a stronghold of opposition against Russian rule, with the majority of Ålanders wanting to reunite with Sweden.\n\nToday this wish was fulfilled, as Swedish forces have managed to gain a significant foothold on the islands. Making landings on Jomala, Föglö and Lemland, the Swedish landing forces made rapid advances to secure the island, pushing out the local garrison from multiple fortifications, including the largest of these in Fort Bomarsund, in a rapid attack towards the northward shores of Åland. The garrisons made hasty attempts to evacuate in the confusion of the attack on small dinghies and whatever ships they could find, but pursuing Swedish forces fired on the fleeing troops from the shore, quickly destroying much of the demoralized garrison.\n\nÅland is now securely in Swedish hands, and is a great victory for the Swedish nation."

 eoanb_sweden.47.d: "The Storting, the Norwegian parliament, has pressured our government into removing the position of Stattholder.

 eoanb_sweden.49.d: "The national parliament of Sweden, the Riksdag, has just announced their intentions in case the King were to sanction the controverisal Stattholder bill. Formulated like a threat, the Riksdag announced they were willing to dissolve the Swedish-Norwegian Union if the King sanctions the bill.

The bill was brought forward by the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, and has the goal of removing the position of Stattholder. Both our government and a majority in the Swedish Riksdag are critical of the law, and are now pressuring the king into abandoning the law.

Hedlund, August Blanche or Lars Johan Hierta. With foreign irregular units as role models in mind, many of the initiators deem the Swedish army too weak and that the will to defend and their morale were low. They want universal conscription and popular armament instead of the old professional army.\n\nThe Skarpskytterörelsen has grown rapidly in popularity as people from all classes in society are joining to learn how to shoot. The government even sponsored construction of shooting ranges.\n\nThe Skarpskytterörelsen, as it turns out, could well become a major advantage for Sweden over the years as it means a larger part of the male population are skilled marksmen and could form irregular combat units in times of need, much like the French Franctireurs."

 eoanb_sweden.57.t: "Swedish Railway Concessions"
 eoanb_sweden.57.d: "During the parlament meetings of 1853 and 1854, the Riksdag announced that Sweden needs to build a railway network. We, the King’s government, have thus been given the task to plan and execute the will of the Riksdag and that of the King. We have given the task of overseeing this huge project to Nils Ericson who has done such exemplary work on Sweden's canals in the past.\n\nMr Ericson has great plans for the future of Swedish railways and has already started work on the first main railway lines that will connect Stockholm to Göteborg and Malmö. There was, however, a heated discussion as to where the railway is supposed to be laid. Since we have full confidence in Mr Ericson and his great engineering skills, we have decided to grant him full powers concerning this project and its implementation.\n\nAccording to the plan laid out by Mr Ericson, the Western Main Line from Göteborg to Stockholm will run between the lakes of Vänern and Vättern, continue south of the city of Örebro and then pass Södertälje on the way to Stockholm.\n\nThe Malmö-Lund part of the Southern Main Line is already complete and the railway will then continue inland passing west of Växjö and through Jönköping before finally linking up with the Western Main Line in Falköping north-west of Jönköping.\n\nWe expect both of these main lines to be complete by 1864, but until then we have to make several important decisions regarding the future of the rest of the Swedish railways."

 eoanb_sweden.58.d: "Today the Western Main Line opened service between Göteborg, Alingsås and Vårgårda. These first 66.2 kilometers of the railway are marked by difficult terrain with lakes and valleys which require expensive construction to be overcome. Mr Ericson himself wrote in a report to us that the Jonsered-Alingsås part is 'the most expensive and labor-intensive part of the Western Main line between Göteborg and the capital in terms of length'.\n\nWith this difficult part now behind us, we are making good progress out on the plains of Västergötland and expect to reach Falköping in October next year."

This has been a specific goal of Mr Ericson, to give small towns far from major roads and waterways a chance to grow and prosper. We have already started constructing the railway north towards Skövde and Töreboda and are making good progress.\n\nIn the south we have also reached Höör, 37.2 kilometers north-east of Lund, and are now continuing towards Hässleholm north-west of Kristianstad.\n\nWe hope to reach Töreboda late in August next year and Hässleholm in December 1860."

This marks a major leap towards the completion of the Western Main Line as only the segment between Sparreholm to Hallsberg is yet to be completed. We hope to inaugurate the entire Western Main Line in November this year.\n\nWork on the Southern Main Line continues from Älmhult towards Nässjö south-east of Jönköping, where we plan to arrive in December 1864.\n\nWe must now focus on the completion of the Western Main Line which lies only three months away and prepare for the great celebration that will follow."

The inauguration during the 3-6th of November was a huge success, never before has it been possible to travel from Göteborg to Stockholm in just 14 hours.\n\nWe have laid 455,9 kilometers of railway tracks, moved 7,140,057 cubic meters of soil, blasted away 310,756 cubic meters of rock. During this process we have constructed 72 bridges, 620 railroad crossings, 50 road bridges and 16 underpasses. We built 40 railway stations and 9 railway stops, the total cost of this huge industrial endeavour lands at around 37,000,000 kronor!\n\nNow we have to finish the Southern Main Line and this first major railway project will be at its much-anticipated end."

Jönköping lies at the southern shore of the lake Vättern with steep slopes on both sides of the town. On the 43 kilometer long stretch between Jönköping and Nässjö we have had to raise the railway no less than 227 meters.\n\nNow we only have the 142 kilometer part between Nässjö and Älmhult left before the Southern Main Line is complete. The terrain in this part mostly consists of forests, moss and bogs and we are expected to finally be able to inaugurate this part in December next year."

There have been crowds in some larger towns along the railway cheering and firing fireworks but nothing like the celebrations along the Western Main Line.\n\nStill this marks the end of Swedens second largest construction project after the Göta canal in 1832, and our first larger railway project. While building the Southern Main Line we have laid 382 kilometers of railway tracks, moved 4,645,000 cubic meters of soil, blasted away 61,500 cubic meters of rock. We constructed 54 bridges, 500 railway crossings, 18 road bridges and 6 underpasses.\n\nWe have also built 28 railway stations and 178 cottages for our platelayers whose job it is to maintain and monitor the railway. All of this cost some 25,000,000 kronor."

 eoanb_sweden.71.t: "The Kingdom of Sweden - Starting Situation"
 eoanb_sweden.71.d: "The Kingdom of Sweden was once one of the great powers of Europe, with an empire spanning from the icecaps of Lappland to the southmost shores of the Baltic Sea. The German and Baltic duchies alike swore fealty to the King of Sweden. Even so, with all her might, Sweden found herself crammed between a lion and a bear, and all her displays of fierce defiance were not enough to keep the wolves at bay. The Great Northern War saw Sweden beaten and shattered. All remaining sentiments of Imperialist fervor were squandered again towards the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, when in 1812, King Charles XIII formally denounced all remaining Swedish claims regarding Finland through the Treaty of Saint Petersburg with Russia and joined the war against France and Denmark-Norway. Consequently, the Treaty of Saint Petersburg placed Sweden on the side of the ultimately victorious Sixth Coalition, awarding our nation with a seat in the Congress of Vienna and securing the allocation of Norway. All is not well. For example, Norwegian nationalism threatens to drive the Kingdom of Norway out of our grasp, and the ever growing popularity of liberal ideals plainly outlines the looming wave of change that will surely soon grip the nation."
