eastern_crisis.11.d: "The liberation struggle in Bosnia and Herzegovina is causing deep sympathies in Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, and European countries such as England, Switzerland, Italy, and others, where committees have been established to support the uprising. The movement to help Herzegovina and the Bosniaks also quickly spread to Russia. The main source of support for the insurgents was the money donated to the Slavic Committees in Moscow and St. Petersburg by the Russian population in the most remote areas of the country. The total amount of donations sent to Herzegovina likely amounts to hundreds of thousands of rubles.\n\nThe struggle for freedom in Bosnia and Herzegovina was also supported by numerous volunteers from Italy, as well as the South Slavic countries of Croatia, Dalmatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and, of course, Russia. In the summer of 1875, members of the Russian revolutionary nationalist movement fought among the Herzegovinian partisans. With their help the uprising might be successful."

eastern_crisis.201.d: "The Romanian Minister of the Interior has been informed that during an inspection in Giurgiu two chests of revolvers and cartridges were found. Over the course of the investigation it was established that Lyuben Karavelov and Hristo Botev were involved in the delivery of the weapons. It remains to be seen what this will mean."
eastern_crisis.201.a: "Hm, interesting."
eastern_crisis.202.t: "Death of Hilarion of Makariopolis"
eastern_crisis.202.d: "Hilarion Makariopolis, prominent advocate of an autonomous Bulgarian church, passed today away in Constantinople. During his earlier years, he spent most of his time in education, his students including several prominent church figures. He also befriended the figurehead of the Bulgarian National Revival, Georgi Rakovski, partaking actively in Macedonian revolutionary activities. His later years were filled more with controversy and conspiracy, particularly in regards to an Easter service he gave which didn't mention the Patriarch of Constantinople, undermining his authority and in breach of canon law. As a result, the Patriarch sent him into exile to Mount Athos for three years, alongside those that supported him. After the establishment of an autonomous Bulgarian Exarchate under Sultan Abdulaziz's firman, he was once again embroiled in controversy after being anathematized by the Patriarchal Synod. This condemnation, later affirmed by the Council of Constantinople, diminished his role within the Bulgarian Orthodoxy, and he lived the rest of his live as Metropolitan of Tarnovo, before eventually passing in Constantinople. His remains are to be buried in St. Stephen's Church."
eastern_crisis.202.a: "May he rest in peace."
eastern_crisis.202.b: "Good riddance!"
eastern_crisis.203.t: "Meeting of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee"
eastern_crisis.203.d: "Following the turbulent turmoil in Herzegovina, rumors have spread amongst the general populace that an organized Bulgarian general uprising to take place in Romania. Led by the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC), currently headed by Hristo Botev, faith in the success of such an undertaking has been significantly diminishing after a majority of the organization's prominent leadership have been arrested, killed, or forced into hiding in the failed attack of Ottoman convoys in 1873, most prominently previous head Vasil Levski. Despite this there have already been reports from local police forces that small-scale uprisings have taken place leading to the arrests of several people. One thing is for sure, we have to be on the lookout."
eastern_crisis.203.a: "Let's hope for the best."
eastern_crisis.203.b: "They will never succeed!"
eastern_crisis.204.t: "The Stara Zagora Uprising"
eastern_crisis.204.d: "In the summer of 1875, the crisis in Turkey deepened as a result of the uprising in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It encouraged the BRCC, which immediately set course for a new uprising. On the initiative of Botev and Stambolov, a general assembly was convened on August 12, 1875, with the participation of representatives from the internal committees. There it was decided to immediately raise a general uprising. A new Central Committee was elected, which includes H. Botev, Dr. H. Chobanov, Iv. Drasov, Ts. Tsenovich and Shopov. After the closing of the assembly, armed action was immediately taken. The country was divided into several operational areas. N. Obretenov, M. Sarafov, P. Volov, St. Drumev, St. Stambolov, Tanyo Stoyanov and Sava Tanasov were chosen as their apostles. A diversionary group, headed by G. Benkovski and St. Zaimov, was also organized to cause disturbances in Constantinople. Botev left for Odessa, where he collected funds for the uprising from the emigration. His task was to bring F. Totyu and Bulgarian officers from the Russian army to head the uprising. As of now only in Stara Zagora there is more serious organizational activity carrying out under the leadership of St. Stambolov. To our knowledge the local revolutionary committee launched a general armed attack on the town, but only a few fighters arrived on the appointed day. We have information that many of the villages did not make contact with the committee. Learning of the armed action, the Stara Zagora nobles immediately reported to us the situation of the revolutionaries. It is time to put the Bulgarian lands completely under our control."
eastern_crisis.204.a: "That sounds like bad preparation."
eastern_crisis.204.b: "Their efforts are in vain, we will crush them in no time!"
eastern_crisis.205.t: "Stara Zagora Uprising Quelled"
eastern_crisis.205.d: "We finally defeated the rebel Bulgarian army after a long and bloody battle in the Balkan Mountains' foothills. Several Bulgarian revolutionaries were captured during the fighting. The Ottoman army finally entered Stara Zagora and put an end to the fighting. It is up to us to prevent future 'manifastations' in Bulgarian territory. It is time to tighten our grip on the region!"
eastern_crisis.205.a: "As expected."
eastern_crisis.206.t: "The Redwater Chetta"
eastern_crisis.206.d: "According to the data of the Sublime Porte, the Bulgarian revolutionaries from Bucharest and Wallachia are preparing, according to our information, an insurrection of not more than 1,000 men in the hamlet of Chervena Voda. Not only did Metropolitan Gregory betray the Chetta, but he also personally arrested its leader Toma Kardjiev, luring him ostensibly to a Christ-loving talk in the metropolitanate. In spite of this and the measures taken on our part, the uprising broke out days later. We must prevent further actions affecting Ruschuk and Northeastern Bulgaria!"
eastern_crisis.206.a: "Their struggle is heroic!"
eastern_crisis.206.b: "Just some peasants..."
eastern_crisis.207.t: "Giurgiu Revolutionary Committee"
eastern_crisis.207.d: "At the end of November 1875, revolutionary activists who had escaped after the failure of the Stara Zagora uprising began to arrive in Gyurgevo - N. Obretenov, St. Stambolov, P. Volov, G. Benkovski, Ilarion Dragostinov and others. They established a new centre of the liberation movement - the Giurgiu Revolutionary Committee. It decided to proceed immediately to the preparation and organization of a major uprising in Bulgaria in the spring of 1876. Taking into account the internal and external difficulties in the empire, the activists considered that a massive and prolonged armed struggle would involve the Sublime Porte in a conflict, provoking the intervention of the Great Powers and Russia. This would lead to a consideration of the Bulgarian question and to a favourable outcome of the liberation struggle of the people. The Committee of Giurgiu divided the country into four revolutionary districts, to which it sent apostles to direct the preparation and conduct of the insurrection. According to the plans of the Giurgiu Committee, 24 strong points were to be built in the territory of the country where women, children and the elderly population could find shelter in case of danger. Insurgent units were to take over the guarding of the old mountain passes. In spite of the paucity of information on the revolutionary processes in the Bulgarian lands, it is of great importance to raise the question of future mobilisation and further intervention in the Bulgarian lands."
eastern_crisis.207.a: "Let's hope they're better organized this time."
eastern_crisis.208.t: "Oborishte National Assembly"
eastern_crisis.208.d: "There are several versions concerning the number of representatives who took part in the Oborishte Assembly. According to foreign documents the number of representatives is 300. From this it can be concluded that many revolutionary activists were present at the assembly, who, however, were not regular delegates, but the total number is unlikely to have exceeded 150. Will this be the first Bulgarian National Assembly? Is this the beginning of the parliamentary democracy in the Bulgarian lands?"
eastern_crisis.208.a: "The end is near!"
OTO_bulgarian_revolt_imminent_effect_tt: "§RWe have reliable sources that a Bulgarian revolt is imminent. We need to act quickly!§!"
eastern_crisis.209.t: "Bulgarian Voice Newspaper"
eastern_crisis.209.d: "The Bulgarian Voice is a Bulgarian revolutionary newspaper first published on 17 April 1876 in Bolgrad, Romania. The newspaper has published 63 issues so far and it is financed by Mihail Mumdzhiev, Kiro Tuleshkov and I. Ivanov are its editors. The newspaper has close ties to the Charity Society and took anti-slavery positions. It defends Lyuben Karavelov, under whose influence it is edited. The newspaper also protests certain iniquities in the Bulgarian lands and advocates for more independence for the Bulgarian people."
eastern_crisis.209.a: "Interesting."
eastern_crisis.209.b: "Looks like the Bulgarians have a voice now."
eastern_crisis.210.t: "The April Uprising"
eastern_crisis.210.d: "After the meeting in Oborishte had ended, and following a betrayal by the revolutionaries' cronies, our army took measures for the arrest of the committee representatives. Nevertheless, the feverish preparations made an impression on the local Muslims and the Ottoman authorities. However, we received certain information about the 'undertaking' only after Oborishte from a participant in the assembly - Nenko Terziiski from Baldovo. Gendarmerie detachments were sent from Pazardzhik to Koprivshtitsa and Panagyurishte to arrest the instigators of the peaceful raja. When an attempt was made to capture Todor Kableshkov, the Koprivshtchi activists attacked and chased away the police with weapons. The müdyurin was killed, and revolutionary rule was established in the town. Under the ringing of the church bells and the thunder of the guns, Kableshkov sent the famous 'Bloody Letter' to Panagyurishte. The letter was carried by 19-year-old Georgi Salchev, who made the five-hour journey from Koprivshtitsa to Panagyurishte in just two hours. Just before Panagyurishte, the horse of the bearer of the bloody letter died from exertion. We must avoid further spread of the insurgency."

eastern_crisis.212.d: "With the Bulgarian uprising at its most raging point, Turkish troops moved into the village of Batak from its lower end. Instead of resisting, the Turkish army was invited even by the Bulgarian nobles themselves, with the message that the village would surrender its arms. Several people did indeed surrender their arms. But as soon as the surrender was over, the Ottoman troops, commonly called 'Bashibozouks', attacked the unarmed victims and struck them with axes. They eventually placed the bodies in the shape of a tree on the ground and started chopping them down like wood. Weeping, screaming, and begging went forth, and the Bashibozouks instilled fear and terror in the entire village. Women, children, and men fled through the streets to the upper reaches to escape the same fate."

But as soon as the surrender was over, the Ottoman troops, commonly called 'Bashibozouks', attacked the unarmed victims and struck them with axes. They eventually placed the bodies in the shape of a tree on the ground and started chopping them down like wood. As the sources say, 'Cries, shrieks, and entreaties issued from the lips of all. But, instead of mercy, it excited more fierce vengeance and a sort of bestial triumph in the midst of these human butchers.' This barbarous deed of the Bashibozouks instilled fear and terror in the entire village. Women, children, and men fled through the village to the upper reaches. We also have accounts of the killing of the elder Trendaphil, which was carried out in an extremely barbaric manner. After plucking out his eyes and pulling out his teeth, the Ottoman soldiers impaled him on a stake and roasted him alive in the midst of a circle of women forced by the Bashibozouks to remain spectators until his death. Another man had his legs, hands, nose and ears cut off. First the victims were robbed and tortured to extort their wealth, and then they were slaughtered. Many men saved their lives only by lying down among the slaughtered and pretending to have been killed already. The same day, about three hundred others were killed at the wooden bridge in front of the school, first their arms and legs, ears and noses and shoulders were cut off and then they were finished off. Women as well as children were involved in the bloodshed."

eastern_crisis.214.d: "The Flying squad, a mounted detachment of around 130 men, was formed in the region around the centre of the uprising. It covered the distance of 30 kilometres between Panagyurishte and Petrich in one night to arrive in a village, where they'd inflict heavy casualties on the Ottoman forces. According to the local Turkish police, the Petricians greeted the detachment with the words: 'How can we not cry, sir? Is it so easy to forget all that we have weighed!', they said, 'not a year, not two, but whole hundreds...' The horsemen in the formation have good equipment and good experience in rapid skirmishing tactics. They are like nothing seen before in the Bulgarian lands. With their help we can crush the enemy!"

The insurgents armed themselves beforehand with weapons and will surely challenge the Ottoman military in the region."

eastern_crisis.216.t: "The Botev Campaign"
eastern_crisis.216.d: "Bulgarian insurgents in exile, led by Hristo Botev, pulled off an elaborated stunt to support the Bulgarian uprising. They boarded the Austrian steamer Radetzky in groups at various stops in disguise, choosing a vessel of the Central European country to avoid causing possible complications for the Romanian government, which granted them protection after fleeing Bulgaria. The Chetniks impersonated gardeners on their way to Kladovo, Serbia. The command of the detachment provided for seizing the ship and taking control of it should the captain refuse to stop at the predetermined landing place. The commander of the ship, captain Engländer, however, not only willingly facilitated the descent to the shore, he also refused to load about 1,000 Turkish soldiers and take them to Kozloduy to pursue the detachment when he was invited by Osman Pasha in Vidin. Botev's insurgents descended on the Kozloduy shore in formation, with a flying flag, and are ready to sacrifice their lives for the cause of Bulgarian independence."

Botev's detachment was already spied on on the territory of Romania. Of the 95 villages and towns that rebelled, only about 10,000 men armed with firearms participated in the uprising. The hasty announcement of the uprising, the authorities' preparedness for a possible rebellion after the Stara Zagora attempted uprising and the Bosnian-Herzegovinian uprising, the extremely insufficient supply of weapons, the inexperience of the apostles, their incoherence and the lack of international interest explain its swift and bloody end.

eastern_crisis.401.d: "After the formation of the League of the Three Emperors in 1872, and the plegde of non-intervention in the Near East, tensions between Christian and Muslim populations within Bosnia and Herzegovina have only been increasing. Despite the best intentions of all powers involved, it seems that the situation has now come to a head. With everyone scrambling for responses and formulating plans, Count Gyula Andrássy of Austria-Hungary has stepped forward with a proposition to enact religious reforms within the Balkans. These reforms controversially proposed the acceptance and integration of Christian law into the Ottoman Islamic law, allowing Christians within Bosnia and Herzegovina to co-exist with their Muslim counterparts. Other changes include the reformation of the tax system which would help alleviate the burden placed on Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as ensuring proper and reliable revenue for the Ottoman authorities. With the backing of the three emperors of Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary, the response will dictate the future of European relations with the Ottoman Empire as well as the well-being of the people of the Balkans."

Although the conference includes many ideas from the major powers, the final decision has been narrowed down to the options proposed by the Austro-Hungarians and the Russians.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian proposal, similar to their previously submitted note and subsequent ultimatum, focuses on religious reforms within the Ottoman Empire, with the goal of integrating Christian law within the Islamic legal system. This would allow for better coexistence between Christian and Muslim populations, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The proposal also includes the reform of tax systems to alleviate the burden on the Balkan population and ensure proper revenue for the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Russian proposal on the other hand calls for the recognition of Bulgarian autonomy and territorial changes in the Balkans. This includes the establishment of a Bulgarian principality, with its own government and army, and the transfer of certain territories from the Ottoman Empire to Bulgaria. Additionally, the proposal includes the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as autonomous provinces within the Ottoman Empire, with their own government and assembly.\n\nBoth proposals have significant implications for the future of the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire, as well as for European relations. The acceptance of the Austro-Hungarian proposal would mean a continuation of Ottoman rule in the Balkans, albeit with religious and tax reforms.

Despite the Sultan already having agreed to share power with the government, the subsequent failures of those previous governments have garnered little favor in the eyes of the Ottoman people. As a result, the head of parliament Grand Vizier Midhat Pasha has declared the demands submitted by the Constantinople Conference unreasonable and thus definitively refusing it under Ottoman rule. With no support from the other European powers, Russia has declared the response unacceptable, and has begun moves to mobilize its units on our border. Elections have already been called by the Sultan, citing that the upcoming and inevitable war with the Russians posed a significant threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our empire. With both the Sultan and parliament in agreement, the government has had little times managing civic affairs in consideration of the upcoming war. Our new constitution and its subsequent parliament have had little time to prove its efficacy in the face of a great diplomatic crisis. With another regional war to occur in the Balkans, the remaining Europeans powers, namely Britain, have taken a keen interest in ensuring that the power dynamic is maintained and kept in balance. Talks have already begun between diplomats and ambassadors about a possible ceasefire being proposed in London, brokering the tension between us and the Russians.

#Berlin Congress Events
eastern_crisis.501.t: "The Treaty of San Stefano - Our Reaction"
eastern_crisis.501.d: "The Treaty of San Stefano, signed on March 3, 1878, has caused a great stir among the European Great Powers. Russia, who emerged victorious in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, has imposed harsh terms on the Ottoman Empire, including the creation of a Greater Bulgaria. This has alarmed other powers such as Britain and Austria-Hungary, who fear that Russia's expansionism will upset the balance of power in Europe.\n\nIn response to the Treaty of San Stefano, the Great Powers are holding a series of diplomatic meetings to discuss their next steps. The Congress of Berlin, which begins on June 13, 1878, is the most important of these meetings. The Congress is attended by representatives from all of the major powers, including Russia, Britain, Austria-Hungary, and Germany.\n\nThe Great Powers are deeply divided over the Treaty of San Stefano. Russia is determined to see its terms implemented, while Britain and Austria-Hungary are equally determined to prevent this. Germany, under the leadership of Chancellor Bismarck, is trying to mediate between the different parties.\n\nDespite their differences, the Great Powers ultimately agree to revise the Treaty of San Stefano. At the Congress of Berlin, they redraw the map of the Balkans and create a smaller Bulgaria, which is divided into three parts. The Ottoman Empire also gains some territories back. The revised treaty, known as the Treaty of Berlin, is signed on July 13, 1878."

eastern_crisis.502.t: "The Treaty of San Stefano - Our Reaction"
eastern_crisis.502.d: "The Treaty of San Stefano, signed on March 3, 1878, has caused a great deal of unrest and dissatisfaction among the Balkan nations. The treaty, imposed by Russia following its victory in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, created a Greater Bulgaria, which included large territories that had previously belonged to other Balkan nations.\n\nBulgaria, which had been liberated from Ottoman rule by Russia, was pleased with the outcome of the treaty. However, the other Balkan nations, including Serbia, Romania, and Montenegro, were outraged by the loss of their territories to Bulgaria. These nations viewed the treaty as a blatant disregard for their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nAs a result, the Balkan nations quickly began to mobilize their armies and prepare for a potential conflict. Serbia, in particular, saw the Treaty of San Stefano as a direct threat to its existence and began to plan a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire, which was seen as being in cahoots with Russia.\n\nThe unrest in the Balkans soon caught the attention of the Great Powers, who were concerned about the potential for a larger conflict. They convened the Congress of Berlin on June 13, 1878, in order to revise the Treaty of San Stefano and to find a solution that would be acceptable to all parties.\n\nAt the Congress, the Balkan nations made their objections to the Treaty of San Stefano clear. They argued for the restoration of their territories and for the recognition of their sovereignty. Ultimately, the revised treaty, known as the Treaty of Berlin, was signed on July 13, 1878. The Balkan nations regained some of their territories, but were left with a sense of dissatisfaction and unease.\n\nAs the Balkan nations continue to simmer with resentment over the Treaty of San Stefano, the Great Powers know that they must work to maintain stability in the region and to prevent further conflicts from erupting."

eastern_crisis.601.d: "Enraged by decades of carrying a tax burden that would not in return benefit their homeland, Albanian peasants and civilians have begun organizing themselves against the despotism of the tax collectors. Ottoman authority has been crumbling lately in the Balkans due to constant unrest among the national minorities living under the Ottoman rule there. The Tanzimat reforms have further destabilized the Albanian lands, as the Muslim Albanians reject the legal emancipation of Christians, and an administrative reform gave rise to Albanian nationalists in the north who fear for their privileges."
eastern_crisis.601.a: "We will silence their complaints!"
eastern_crisis.602.t: "Albanians Rebel Against Tax Collection Again"
eastern_crisis.602.d: "Ottoman power in the Northwestern Balkans has been heavily tested lately, and the Albanians fear that they might end up under the overlordship of a Christian power. Additionally, the Ottoman administration has increased their tax burden even further, as expenses have risen with the necessary responses to combat uprisings. Yet again, Albanian gangs and tribes have set up local councils to organize resistance against the measures they perceive as unfair and threatening."
eastern_crisis.602.a: "How dare they!"
eastern_crisis.603.t: "Albanians Rebel Against Conscription"
eastern_crisis.603.d: "The men responsible for conscription in the Albanian lands are reporting large-scale resistance against conscription measures there. The Albanians seem unwilling to do their part in the Ottoman military and instead are hiding in the remote areas of the country, where no Ottoman official can set foot without the risk of being harmed. It seems like the Albanian people need more incentive to take up arms..."
eastern_crisis.603.a: "These cowards!"
eastern_crisis.604.t: "Local Councils for National Salvation in Albania"
eastern_crisis.604.d: "In fear of beng drawn into the bloody conflicts in the surrounding lands in the Balkans, and potentially falling under the rule of a Christian power, leaders of the Albanian intellectual community have gathered to establish so-called 'councils for national salvation' across Albania. These councils are responsible for the protection the Albanian populated lands from foreign, especially Christian, oppression. This might well be a signal for increasing nationalist tendencies in Albania in the near future."
eastern_crisis.604.a: "We need to be careful."
eastern_crisis.605.t: "Foundation of the Central Committee for the Defense of Rights of the Albanian Nation"
eastern_crisis.605.d: "With more unrest among the Christian ethnicities on the Balkans, and now even support from European great powers for their struggle against the Ottomans, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Albanians to defend the territorial integrity of the Albanian lands. Ottoman administrators, many of them of Albanian descent, already had to flee the revolting regions in fear for their lives. The leaders of the councils for national salvation have gathered in Constantinople to merge their organizations into a single coordination body, the so-called 'Central Committee for the Defense of Rights of the Albanian Nation'. Although they seem poised to defend Muslim authority in the Balkans, a goal we would obviously support, Albanian nationalist tendencies also seem to be growing stronger among their ranks."

eastern_crisis.606.t: "Foundation of the League of Prizren"
eastern_crisis.606.d: "The Treaty of San Stefano triggered profound anxiety among the Albanians and Bosniaks, and it spurred their leaders to organize a defense of the lands they inhabited. Lead by influential Albanians in Constantinople — including Abdyl Frashëri, the Albanian national movement's leading figure — organized a committee to direct the Albanians' resistance against Christian occupation of their lands. They recently hosted a meeting in Prizren to that effect. The resulting League of Prizren was created by a group of Albanian intellectuals to resist partition among neighboring Balkan states and to assert an Albanian national consciousness by uniting Albanians into a unitary linguistic and cultural nation."
