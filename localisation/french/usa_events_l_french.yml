After all of the expenses to build the plant, the 'Union Coal, Iron and Transportation Company' did not have sufficient funds to open the plant. Causing the delay of operation.\n\nA reorganization of the company in 1873 resulted in the newly formed Joliet Iron and Steel Company. But a stock market crash and the failure of American banks, known as the Panic of 1873, delayed the opening of the plant yet again...\n\nBut by 1879, the Joliet Steel Company finally opened! The American industry is back on its feet, and the demand for workers has increased. Immigrants flood Chicago, arriving from northern and western Europe possessing the industrial skills needed to operate the mill."

 # Introduction to the United States
 usa.249.t: "The issues in these United States"
 usa.249.d: "These United States of America comprise a new nation, only nearing a century old. They gained independence from Great Britain when they drafted the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and gained victory in the American Revolutionary War in 1783. However, their problems didn't disappear as they were troubled with many issues: There are the relationship and conflicts with the natives, the debate on slavery, manifest destiny, relationships with both the old world and the new world, debate over state's rights vs a federal system, the rapidly industrialization of society, and more.\n \nWe are now in May of 1857, under the Buchanan presidency who's only been in office for about two months. He has his plate full with the clashes between the abolitionists and people who are pro-slavery, the Third Seminole War happening, and the poor relationship with the mormon government of the Utah territory.\n \nWe have been collecting reports regarding these three issues, if you wish to read more into them."
 usa.249.a: "The Seminoles in Florida."
 usa.249.b: "The issue regarding slavery."
 usa.249.c: "The Mormons in Utah."
 usa.249.e: "I've read enough!"
 usa.250.t: "At war with the Seminoles"
 usa.250.d: "This Third Seminole War started around two years ago in late 1855 when a group of forty Seminoles led by Billy Bowlegs attacked a camp. They killed and scalped four soldiers in the camp, killed the wagon mules, both looted and burned the wagons, and stole several horses. We received news of this from seven men, four of them wounded, when they returned to Fort Myers and passed it along to Tampa.\n \nThe Democratic Governor of Florida, James E. Broome, organized all the volunteer companies he could, but with limited funds, seeked support from the US Army. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis sent Broome two infantry and three mounted companies to aid him. However, raids from the natives still occurred, especially on the coast south of Tampa Bay. A party of around twenty Seminoles under Ocsen Tustenuggee attacked a wood cutting patrol outside Fort Denaud, killing five of the six men. The natives even attacked “Braden Castle,” a plantation home owned by Dr. Joseph Braden, although defeated they freed seven slaves and three mules. While eating at camp, the militia caught up and killed and scalped two and returned both the slaves and the mules to the plantation. The scalps of the natives were shown off at Tampa and Manatee. On May 14, 1856, they attacked the farm house of Captain Robert Bradley, a veteran of the Second Seminole War, and killed two of his young children; this happened presumably because he killed Tiger Tail's brother.\n \nOne major victory happened on June 16 when twenty militiamen from Fort Fraser surprise attacked a group of Seminoles along Peace River before retreating after receiving two dead and three wounded, even with these losses, they managed to kill one of the actively raiding chiefs, Ocsen Tustenuggee. Floridians were dissatisfied by these militias, claiming they were given to idleness, drunkenness, and thievery, claiming that they would pretend to patrol for a day or two, then go home to work their fields. This led to Brigadier General William S. Harney, veteran of the Second Seminole War, to take command of the federal troops in September 1856. He planned to actively pursue the natives, yet this plan ended up showing few results and he was replaced by Colonel Gustavus Loomis when Harney was transferred to Kansas to aid in the uprisings.\n \nThis whole war has been plagued with incompetence, hopefully Loomis can save things..."
 usa.250.a: "What else is there?"
 usa.251.t: "Slavery's Legitimacy"
 usa.251.d: "Slavery is a system that has stuck with us since our status as a colony, and has been debated within these states since the founding of our country in 1776. The controversial nature of it is why the words “slave” and “slavery” do not appear in our constitution although several provisions refer to it. It was to the south's benefit that the Three-Fifths Compromise came about  after the 1787 United States Constitutional Convention, as slaves were counted at a rate of three-fifths their total number, this aiding those states in Congressional apportionment and in the Electoral College. Eventually, the process of bringing over slaves from Africa was deemed illegal when the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves became effective in 1808, yet of course slaves were still smuggled illegally.\n \nThis of course didn't end the act as the slaves are human beings, and reproduce as all living things do. It of course was not a pleasant thing as they are seen as property and female slaves are subject to being sexual objects. It happened enough that the code “fancy ladies” was used to indicate the slave for sale was suitable for or trained for sexual use, children were not immune to said title. In our recent 1850 Census, around 75% of the free black population were considered mulattos, people of mixed race.\n \nThroughout the years the US has grown, gaining new territory, and with that comes the issue of determining whether new states admitted were considered free or slave states. The first compromise we did for this was the Missouri Compromise of 1820 after events like the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. It stated that states south of the 36°30' were admitted as slave states and those north were free. During the meeting, it was determined, however, that Missouri would be a slave state and the formation of Maine would happen, being a free state, separating from Massachusetts.\n \nThis agreement would not last because three decades later, the Compromise of 1850 would occur after the Mexican-American War. Territory was taken from Texas to form the Territories of New Mexico and Utah, with the promise they would decide on whether they would become a slave or free state on their own. California was admitted as a free state. The Compromise of 1850 also included the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 which states that federal judicial officials in all states and territories, free or slave, to assist in the return of escaped slaves to their masters.\n \nIn the more recent years, we haven't fared much better. Abolitionists and pro-slavery citizens still have clashes. This can be seen in the Bleeding Kansas scenario that we have been dealing with the past few years. The south has also not been too happy with the extremely popular abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. Even with the decades of appeasement on these issues, trying to find compromise, the situation doesn't seem to be getting better.\n \nWill we ever resolve this debate?"
 usa.251.a: "What else is there?"
 usa.252.t: "The Territory of Utah"
 usa.252.d: "The Mormons have encountered decades of persecution, starting with the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, Joseph Smith, moving from New York to Jackson County, Missouri in 1831. It wasn't long before clashes occurred between the two groups and the Mormons were evicted in 1833 and resettled in nearby counties. Yet tensions rose again and a battle erupted between the two that left twenty-two dead in 1838. This led to Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs passing Missouri Executive Order 44, which ordered the Mormons to leave or be killed. Smith surrendered at their headquarters in Far West, and left for Illinois with around 10,000 other Mormons.\n \nThere they encountered some internal issues as William Law, Smith's counselor, and Robert Foster, general of the Nauvoo Legion, disagreed with how Smith was running their town of Nauvoo's economy. Polygamy being a thing in the church, they were also upset how he proposed to their wives. Smith excommunicated them for the fear they were plotting against his life. They then created a new denomination called the True Church of the Latter Day Saints, which published its only newspaper issue, in the Navuoo Expositor, which called for reform in the church, attacked Smith's advocation for polygamy, and decried Smith's theocratic ambitions.\n \nSmith overreacted and censored the press in Navuoo and mobilized the Navuoo Legion to enact martial law, this made Carthage officials mobilize their militias and Illinois Governor Thomas Ford appeared demanding his surrender or he would have brought a larger force. Smith and his brother Hyrum both surrendered and were imprisoned on grounds for treason. While in the Carthage Jail, a mob stormed the jail and assassinated both Smith and his brother, this all happening in 1844. Tensions were not eased, there was still a lot of anti-mormon support and they wished to remove them from the state. Brigham Young was eventually elected as leader of the Church of the Latter Day Saints, and when he saw no chance at peace, he prepared everyone for the Mormon Exodus. This led them to settle what is now known as the Utah Territory in 1847.\n \nThey wished to be able to govern their own lands so the State of Deseret was proposed in 1849. However, the best they could receive was under the Compromise of 1850, where they became a US Territory and their leaders were elected by the president. As a sign of good faith, President Millard Fillmore elected Brigham Young as the first governor of the Utah Territory. Even with this, there were still non-Mormons elected in some other positions, some liked by the Mormons, however, the majority were not.\n \nHopefully with them having their own land, there will be no more conflict between both mormon and non-Mormons."
 usa.252.a: "What else is there?"
 usa.253.t: "A Nation Rebuilding"
 usa.253.d: "The United States is a country in the midst of rebuilding itself. After a brutal Civil War that has left entire states savaged and hundreds of thousands dead, the nation has much to remorse over.\n \n Despite this, the United States is on the rise. The government, now strongly secured with Republican Majorities, is no longer divided against itself like decades past. The economy, revitalized from years of turmoil by the War is quickly industrializing — and with help of a new generation of inventors, is the most technological in the world. Finally, the newly modernized US Military is the largest in the world. It is now longer in question whether the United States is a world power."

 usa_slavery_debate.15.t: "The Kansas Situation"
 usa_slavery_debate.15.d: "Drafted by Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois, the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 defined the two new territories in the Western plains: Kansas and Nebraska. Effectively repealing the previous Missouri Compromise, the Act defined that the Provisional Governments of Kansas and Nebraska were to carry votes of 'Popular Sovereignty' where the settlers of each territory were to decide whether they were legalize or ban the practice of Slavery.\n \nWhile Nebraska has seen relative peace, Kansas Territory has become the hotbed of intense settlement as Southerners from Missouri and Northerners from the New England have flooded the soon-to-be-state, in hopes of influencing the Territory's referendum on Slavery.\n \nFights between rival groups of northerner 'Bushwhackers' and southerner 'Border Ruffians' have plagued Kansas Territory for since then, and have only ramped up since the signing of the Topeka Convention — an illegal convention held exclusively by Abolitionists to form a proto-state legislature.\n \nThere have been calls by many in congress to send in a federal garrison and incentivize the two sides to meet together to negotiate on the State's future."

 usa.36.d: "The Election of 1864 is split on the issue of the Confederacy. Although not as big as the Election of 1860, this election will still have a major impact. It was fought primarily between President [ROOT.GetLeader], who advocated for a further push on the South, while the opposing Democratic Party is led by George B McClellan, who, although he wishes to continue the war, the other Copperhead Democrats will push hard on him to request peace with the Confederacy.

It seems that George agrees that the fight against the South should continue, but the Copperheads in the Democratic party hold great sway over him, and could force him to offer peace to the Confederacy."

 usa.40.d: "After the end of the Crimean War, the Russian Government is really low on funds and is seeking new ways to obtain needed revenue. The Russians also hold a vast territory in the Americas, Alaska, which has an extremely low population. The Russians once attempted to sell Alaska to us back in 1859, but it was drowned under the tensions surrounding the American Civil War. Now, however, we have a chance to attempt the purchase of this territory."

 usa.40.b: "It's just a wasteland..."
 usa.41.t: "Purchase of Alaska?"
 usa.41.d: "Last morning, the Americans had arrived in the capital for a deal they were willing to purchase the territory of Alaska. We are short in funds, and should we get into a War with the British, then it would be very easy for them to take the sparsely populated territory. We have been discussing the selling of Alaska for years now, almost a decade even, however the Americans became too embroiled in their Civil War to focus attention on the purchase. Perhaps now we can arrange a deal?"

 usa.43.t: "Emperor of the United States?"

Afterwards in the same paragraph of this declaration, he decreed that the United States Congress be assembled in Musical Hall of San Francisco, the city he lives in. It appears as though the populace of the city had gone along with him in a joking mindset, but of which is slowly beginning to morph into serious devotion. \n \nHe holds no close ties to the Military, so we can easily choose to ignore him. However, such a bold move by one man that is beginning to be taken seriously by the people of his hometown is beginning to represent the forgotten legitimacy of the Federal Government during this time of crisis."

Now is not the time for celebration, however, for we must decide what to do with the lands that revolted against us. \n \nThere are four different ways to handle this, ranging from Gentlest to Harshest.

 usa.45.d: "It was late into the night as the carriage arrived, as the astute President exited with his wife, as well as Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris, who had accepted an invitation by the Presidential couple to attend the theater with them. After helping Mary out of the carriage, the party entered and settled into their box in the Theater. As they arrived, the play was interrupted by the orchestra who played 'Hail to the Chief' as the 1,700 attendants applauded. \n \nIt was a bright and elaborate play, giving their all to ensure the President would love such a play. The bright lights and beauty of such a performance was astonishing. \n \nAs the intermission came, the party talked with one another within the Box, and refreshed themselves. They did notice that their policeman John Frederick Parker, who was assigned to guarding the president's box, was missing. However, it was assumed that he had simply gone to the tavern for a drink, and be back shortly. \n \nThen, after the intermission, the infamous line played 'Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal; you sockdologizing old man-trap!'. The audience burst into laughter at one of the best lines in the play, including the presidential party, as Rathbone turned to see the President wheezing with laughter. It was a loud and hilarious atmosphere... \n \nLoud enough to drown out the creaking door behind the President."

 usa.47.d: "President Davis met with his Confederate Cabinet for the last time in Washington, Georgia, where they officially disbanded the Confederate Government. However, they still attempted to flee the Union in order to escape from Federal Forces and create a government-in-exile. \n \nIt was not to be, however, as a few days later Jefferson and his wife, Varina, were captured by Union forces at Irwinville, Georgia. \n \nMedia reports state that Davis put his wife's overcoat over his shoulders while fleeing, which led to him becoming a laughingstock, portrayed as attempting to flee in women's clothing, despite testimony from his wife that he was given it because he felt sick. Nevertheless, the former Confederate President is now in our custody!"
 usa.47.a: "Great news!"
 usa.48.t: "Davis Flees the States!"
 usa.48.d: "After confirmed reports of Jefferson Davis came to light that he was in the harbor of Tampa, Florida, it was too late to catch him. He, as well as several other Confederate leaders, were able to flee from the Union's grasp. It is now expected that he will flee to foreign governments in an attempt to create a Confederate government-in-exile. \n \nWe must keep a close eye out and pursue him, for he could still be captured and returned back to the States."

 usa.49.d: "After losing in the American Civil War, Jefferson Davis and dozens of Confederate leaders were able to escape from Federal forces and proceeded to sail off to foreign lands to establish a new Confederate government-in-exile. \n \nThe Confederate ship had asked for permission to dock in Rio de Janeiro, and had come to [BRA.GetLeader], pleading for safety and sanctuary in the city. \n \nIf we were to allow them to stay, it would damage our relationship with the United States. Or, we could refuse and allow them to leave on their way. Or, perhaps, we could capture the Confederate refugees and return them to the United States to boost our relations with them."

We received reports of them in Brazil but upon meeting [BRA.GetLeader], he stated that he refused their sanctuary and sent them on their way. Later, we tracked their ship to Paris, but even then [FRA.GetLeader], who, similarly to [BRA.GetLeader], stated that they sent the Confederates off. \n \nAfter investigating a report of the ship being docked in London, one of our ships were able to spot the Confederate ship leaving dock at London.

Although it is still much more popular in the North than in the South, the race relations in the South has seen dramatic improvement compared to a decade ago. \n \nNow, the Radicals in the Republican Party seek to enforce this officially, and have pushed Congress to enact the Full Equality Act. It would give the Federal Government much more power to enforce Non-Discrimination throughout the country. Although it is still facing resistance in Congress and by the People, and it won't immediately solve race issues. If we were to push this bill forward we may be able to pass it."

However, as our soldiers begin to fight, sleep, and eat with these Irishmen, the social stigma of their nature and barbarity have begun to fade as we truly see the Irish for what they are."

The community is based on individual sovereignty, and to become a self-sufficient community without police or other government services. Although it has not faced much trouble, it has encountered a new problem. As the Panic of 1857 hits the village, it has effected its ability to perform labor, and people are now being forced to travel out of the community for work.

Claiming to be acting out their right to liberty and pursuit of happiness, they have begun to attract attention to their community. However, the government can claim the Commerce Clause, in which Congress should have the power to regulate commerce between the states.

The vast majority of the support granted to Modern Times was given by New York City, but other than that there is a mixed reaction. The troubling part of this, however, is the fact that Modern Times is beginning to support radical ideas of socialism and communism, calling on the fact that the govnerment and capitalism is failing the community. Despite that fact, Josiah Warren is steadfast in his anarchist ideology, but we cannot be guaranteed his loyalty."

 usa.167.t: "The Annexation Treaty of Santo Domingo"
 usa.167.d: "In fears of being invaded by its hostile neighbor Haiti along with the prolonged economic and political instability of the nation, President Báez has come to a mutual agreement with President [USA.Get.Leader] to negotiate a treaty placing the Dominican Republic as a US protectorate. The president thinks that, if successful, the treaty would force the South to treat its African Americans better, since immigration to the newly acquired land would allow better job opportunities for them, whilst liberating the slaves that live in the former Spanish colony as well. The Congress, who is divided between the Radical Republicans and a coalition of Democrats and Liberal Republicans ultimately decide to..."

 usa.168.t: "The Liberal-Radical Republican Split"
 usa.168.d: "The Radicals' methods of reforming the South has caused discontent with the more moderate faction of the Republican Party, the Liberals. Headed by Carl Schurz, the Liberal Republicans were filled with angst against their Radical counterparts, stating that while they praised President [ USA.Get.Leader ]'s efforts of abolishing slavery from the South, they opposed the other radical policies that they deemed to be oppressive and rather unconstitutional. The divide between the two factions has gotten worse as the 1872 Presidential Elections draw closer than ever, and the Liberals split to create a party of their own, the Liberal Republican Party, and there is rumours that the new party is allying itself with the Democratic Party to defeat the incumbent president."
 usa.168.a: "This is a disaster!"
 usa.169.t: "Formation of the Half-Breed Faction"
 usa.169.d: "After the collapse of the Liberal Republican Party following the death of one of their key leaders, Horace Greeley, in 1872, most of the liberal Republicans has decided to reunite with their old party, while some joined the Democratic Party. However, even after being welcomed by their old allies, they still hold opposition to Grant's radical policies, as well as favoring a merit system that the Radicals vehemently oppose. The Republican Party, while united in name, is deeply divided between the ideas of the Radicals and the Half-Breeds."
 usa.169.a: "How many splits shall the GOP endure?"
 usa.171.t: "Construction of commerce raiders to the Confederate States?"
 usa.171.d: "The Confederate States of America has sent an envoy to us and pledged to pay the British with cotton and/or gold if we construct ships for them to help in their war effort against the Union. If we help them, it would help maintain our preexesting cotton trade with the Americas, as well as a temporary boost to our industries, but this diplomatic overture can irritate the United States later on, and possibly making them our rival for years to come. The Parliament has made a decision to..."
 usa.171.a: "Authorize the construction of commerce raiders to the CSA"
 usa.171.b: "No! We must enforce our commitment to Strict Neutrality!"
 usa.172.t: "The Alabama Claims"
 usa.172.d: "The British who although declared strict neutrality during our Civil War, has allowed the construction of 5 warships to which they know would aid the Confederate Navy, including the CSS Alabama, which took 64 prizes before being finally sunk. This is a blatant violation of their neutrality, and a stab in the back for us, and has possibly prolonged our conflict with the CSA for a year or more. The Radical Republicans has sought to compensate for the losses with the annexation of British Columbia and a payment of $2 billion, while American expansionists included the Red River Colony and Nova Scotia to undermine British influence in Canada. The more moderate Liberal Republicans and the recovering Democratic Party has proposed to solve the problems by seeking arbitration to other Great Powers, and settling for a more reasonable compensation, while preserving the status quo borders in the north to prevent angering the British and possibly making a rival out of them in the future. The Congress, after intense debates on how to react on the claims, decides to..."

 usa.173.t: "The Alabama Ultimatum"
 usa.173.d: "The Americans have sent an ultimatum to us stating that we must compensate for the ships that we have constructed to help the Confederate war effort, most notably the CSS Alabama. The Americans offered a condition to give control over British Columbia and a payment of $2 Billion to negate the damages that they accuse us of doing during the Civil War. Failure to comply would mean war between the two countries, or so they say. What should we do?"
 usa.173.a: "Accept the terms of the Ultimatum, we can't afford to lose relations with the Americans"
 usa.173.b: "Accept paying for compensation, but decline the annexation of British Columbia"

 usa.175.t: "The British declines the annexation of British Columbia"

 usa.177.d: "The United States ambassador has notified us that our violation of our strict neutrality by allowing the construction of 5 commerce raiders to aid the Confederate Navy has caused them a disturbance and accused us of prolonging their civil war by a year or two. We have feared for the worst, since the Radical Republicans had clamoured in their nation to demand British Columbia from us, but seeing how the United States wants to have an arbitration between us, it looks like that they would push for more moderate compensations instead. Shall we accept their proposed arbitration with a neutral power?"
 usa.177.a: "We must comply to their demands, we can't risk our good relations for those cruisers"
 usa.177.b: "It's just a trading business, can't the Americans accept that?"
 usa.178.t: "The Treaty of Washington"
 usa.178.d: "The USA and the British have asked for our arbitration to settle their dispute over the British construction of CSS Alabama and more for the Confederate Navy in 1862, with the United States accusing Britain of prolonging the civil war while violating their declared stance of strict neutrality. The American delegates demand compensation for such "violation", while the British delegates has defended themselves by stating that it was their trade neutrality policy when the civil war occurred, and thus they argued that they can trade with both nations, the Union and the Confederates. With whom shall we side in our arbitration?"
 usa.178.a: "The United States seems to be more reasonable in this case."

 usa.179.d: "The Italian delegates has ruled that the Americans have reasoned out pretty well, and that the British have violated their stance of strict neutrality during the American Civil War. The Italians also stated that they must compensate the Americans with the sum of $15.8 million, much smaller than what the Radical Republicans has expected, but at least enough to prove that the British are at the wrong side"

 usa.179.c: "Good!"
 usa.180.t: "Treaty of Washington - British Victory"
 usa.180.d: "The Italian delegates has ruled that the British have reasoned out pretty well, and that the British have not violated their stance of strict neutrality during the American Civil War. As thus, the Italians have stated that Britain is absolved from any demands or claims that America may represent regarding the matter about CSS Alabama."
 usa.180.a: "This is a disaster!"
 usa.180.b: "The Italians are wise to move to our side"
 usa.180.c: "They just absolved them of possible violations?"
 usa.185.t: "The Compromise of 1877"
 usa.185.d: "The elections of 1876 is one of the most controversial and intensely disputed elections in the history of the United States of America. The Democratic forerunner, Samuel G. Tilden, had won the popular vote on his own right, and carried 184 Electoral Votes compared to the Republicans' 165. However, there are three disputed states: South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana where none have secured an overwhelming victory. The 20 electoral votes from these states could win the Republicans their nomination, and there are some Democratic Congressmen offering a compromise to gain these votes: the removal of federal troops in the South. Should we accept the terms of the compromise, we would secure the presidency away from the Democratic Party, at the cost of allowing the Redeemers to take over the South. However, if we don't accept this, it would be handing over the electoral votes in a silver platter to Tilden, and make us lose our grip at the White House, at least for four years, but we will retain our control in the South. What should we decide to do?"
 usa.185.a: "We shall agree with the compromise."
 usa.185.b: "Just fulfill some, and secretly maintain some of the troops in the South"
 usa.185.c: "We shall not allow these Redeemers gain a foothold in the South!"
 usa.186.t: "The Collapse of the Radical Republicans"
 usa.186.d: "Disaster! After compromising with the Democrats, a lot of Radical Republicans had lost hope in the current government, and had instead sought for a more moderate stance towards the enfranchisement of the blacks. With such things happening, the Redeemers had commenced their plans to institute the Jim Crow Laws, a policy of segregation that was abolished during the Reconstruction. We shall endure these inequalities at least until a civil rights reform shall arise."
 usa.186.a: "Backstabbing Democrats!"
 usa.187.t: "The Radical Era"
 usa.187.d: "Although Samuel Tilden was appointed as the President of United States and broke our hold in the White House, the Radical Republicans have consolidated their hold in the Deep South, and has broken through the toughest resistance of the former Confederate Loyalists. The threat of the Redeemers were quashed, and we could safely assume that the inequalities of this nation would be corrected for many years to come"
 usa.187.a: "Equality and Freedom for all"
 usa.189.t: "The Democratic Party Split"
 usa.189.d: "Infighting amongst Democrats who favor the subjugation of the Southern States, called the War Democrats, and those who favor a peaceful coexistence with the CSA or to admit the seceded states and comply to their demands, called the Copperhead Democrats has caused the fracture of the Democratic Party to be more visible, and therefore weakening the party's stronghold in the border states. Only time will tell if the incumbent president will take advantage of the split to be elected again, or to let it pass and make the Democrats heal the rip in the party."
 usa.189.a: "This is rather surprising"
 usa.190.t: "The creation of a National Union Party"
 usa.190.d: "Political advisors from the party has advised to rename our party temporarily to attract to "National Union Party" to garner more attraction from the loyal War Democrats and other third parties who seem to not vote for us. This strategy is said to overtip the Copperhead Democrats who dominate the border states, and to firmly secure Lincoln's second term. It could also boost the morale of the whole nation, that we are united against the rebellious Confederates, but the Radicals may not look at this party coalition as a good thing. Shall we form this coalition party?"
 usa.190.a: "In these trying times, we must unite the Americans into a one nation under one party"
 usa.190.b: "A coalition would just upset the ideas that we were built upon by allying ourselves with those Democrats"
 usa.191.t: "The 1864 National Union Convention"
 usa.191.d: "The National Union Party's presidential primaries have unanimously voted for Abraham Lincoln to continue his presidency and oversee the lingering conflict with the South. However, the delegates are divided on who to pick as his forerunner in the upcoming elections between Andrew Johnson, a popular War Democrat, or the incumbent Vice President Hannibal Hamlin, a Republican. If we elect Johnson, we would reinforce the idea that the party is indeed a union of the Democrats loyal to us and our Republican Party, but if we choose Hamlin, our coalition could fall apart easily. Who shall we elect as our Vice President?"
 usa.191.a: "Andrew Johnson"
 usa.191.b: "Hannibal Hamlin"
 usa.192.t: "The Radical Democracy Party supports Lincoln"
 usa.192.d: "Although a split from the party occurred when the Radicals have created their own party and national convention by electing John C. Frémont as president, the latter sought to reunite the party as he felt that the split from the party will allow a Democratic Party victory. With the Radicals reunited from the party, Lincoln is confident that he could secure another term as a president"
 usa.192.a: "Excellent"
 usa.193.t: "Collapse of the National Union Party"
 usa.193.d: "War Democrats had denounced the National Union Party as a "coalition in name only" with the election of Hamlin as the Vice President on the National Convention that happened a week earlier. They have reasoned out to Lincoln that two Republicans controlling the two key positions for the upcoming elections just made them believe of the "lies" that was spread, and a "scam" to attract support when in reality it is just a renamed Republican Party. After denouncing the coalition, the disgruntled War Democrats reconciled with its Copperhead counterparts and therefore strengthening the Democratic Party in the upcoming elections. This disastrous decision made Lincoln to ponder whether his position is still secure, as the nation is once more invigorated with a party divide while the nation is fighting the rebellious Southern states."
 usa.193.a: "Our differences are just too great to find a common ground"
 usa.194.t: "Collapse of the National Union Party"
 usa.194.d: "With a Republican-dominated Congress, the unpopular president Andrew Johnson had to deal with the opposition when he tried to pass laws to the Congress to admit the Southern States as soon as possible, and strived for a more moderate Reconstruction. These decisions made him unpopular especially to the Radical Republicans, who had constituted to reestablish their Republican Party months when Lincoln was assassinated. Johnson's incapability to maintain the coalition can be partly blamed to his pro-Democrat policies, instead of appeasing the other side as well. One thing is for sure though, and that the coalition is no more."
 usa.194.a: "It was inevitable anyway"
 usa.195.t: "Collapse of the National Union Party"
 usa.195.d: "Differences amongst the Republicans and War Democrats deemed to be too much, and while Lincoln tried to satisfy both sides in the coalition, the more influential and powerful Republicans pushed for a more radical approach to the Reconstruction, which angered the Democrats that they have formed a coalition on. With the civil war over, the National Union's common ground is gone, and were just dominated with harsh fighting in the Congress. The party finally collapsed when Lincoln finally caved in to his Republican allies about the Reconstruction, with the Democrats calling him a "traitor" for doing so. The National Union's Democrats then returned to the Democratic Party, vowing to push Republican influence in the White House out of it in the upcoming presidential elections."
 usa.195.a: "It was inevitable anyway"
 usa.196.t: "The admission of the Prohibition Party"
 usa.196.d: "In light of the recent radical changes in the South that immediately took effect after the Civil War, some branches of the International Organisation of Good Templars has taken this opportunity to create a political party that furthers their goals of alcoholic prohibition, whom they blamed as the poison to a healthy relationship. While the newly-created Prohibition Party is pretty unpopular right now, the leaders hope that they can pass an amendment that prohibits alcohol in the future."
 usa.196.a: "Who took my booze?"
 usa.206.t: "The formation of the Greenback Party"
 usa.206.d: "The monopolies that controlled the United States of America during the now-occuring Gilded Age has caused a lot of discontent among those who were affected from it, while opposing both the Republicans' and Democrats' support on a bullion-based monetary system. These dissenters have formed a third-party, named the "Greenback Party", after their support for the production of "greenbacks", which based the money value on the bonds, not on the gold-standard."
 usa.206.a: "Gold's still invaluable"
 usa.210.t: "The Populist Party's platform"
 usa.210.d: "After not nominating candidates for the 1888 Presidential Elections, the doom of the Greenback Party was certain. Since most of the Greenback Party's appeal to the labor unions declined in the 1880s, the party followed suit, along with its eventual dissolution in 1889. However, some hopeful former Greenbacks under James B. Weaver's leadership hoped to restore the confidence of the labor unions under a new party, the People's Party, mostly known to the United States as the Populist Party. Unlike the advocacy of greenback monetary policy, the Populists advocated the system of bimetallism, which also appealed to some Democrats, and absorbing the small Union Labor Party as well. With an enlargened support base, Weaver hopes that they could introduce the policy to the Congress, and perhaps finally remove some dependence to the gold standard."
 usa.210.a: "New name, same platform"

 usa.269.t: "Midway Atoll"
 usa.269.d: "(The island was originally called Brooks Island, after the man who discovered it, but was later changed to Midway, as it's in the middle of the Hawian island chain.)\n \nMr. President! A letter has recently arrived at the front desk of the White House, informing that a small atoll near the center of the pacific has been found as a suitable environment in the search for guano. Under the Guano Islands Act, passed earlier last year, the island is now under claims of the United States. Captain N.C Middlebrooks, a known merchant on the Pacific coast, was said to be sailing the sealing ship, Gambia, when he first spotted the island. He finishes his letter with a description of the atoll, a large ring island with plenty of usable space, he also writes that he will return soon with more information on the island."
 usa.269.a: "All this for a bunch of birdshit?"
 usa.270.t: "Navassa Island Claim"
 usa.270.d: "Mr. President! Recent news from a sea captain by the name of Peter Duncan, who has reported the discovery of a small, uninhabited island off the coast of Haiti that has yet to be claimed, as well as the stockpiles of guano it possesses. Under the Guano Island Act, he has claimed the Island for the United States. A diplomat from the state of Haiti has conflicted with this claim, as the Haitian government has already claimed the island since 1801. Nonetheless, this shouldn't cause too many problems."
 usa.271.t: "Navassa Island Annexation"
 usa.271.d: "On this day, President James Buchanon has issued an executive order upholding the American claim on the island of Navassa, for its annexation as an unincorporated territory of the Union. More diplomats from the state of Haiti have shown up on the foot of the capital, protesting against the annexation, claiming it to be under the administration of Haiti already. Despite these demonstrations, Congress has agreed to the order that now the guano-rich island of Navassa is now under complete American control."
 usa.272.t: "Kingman Reef"
 usa.272.d: "Mr. President! Situated in the center of the Pacific, the small island of Kingman Reef was found by Captain W. E. Kingman in years prior to the Guano Islands Act. Named after the captain who found it, the reef was recently claimed by the United States Guano Company, in search of large guano deposits on the reef. Interestingly though, we've yet to find any signs of guano on the island. The island is still under investigation, but it's been reported that the island poses a threat to workers searching for guano, so the project has a high probability of being abandoned."
 usa.273.t: "Johnston Atoll Flag Taken Down"
 usa.273.d: "Mr. President! A report has reached the Capital to inform us that the claim on the small, guano-abundant island of Johnston Atoll has been recently usurped by the Kingdom of Hawaii, and renamed it to Kalama Island, under the idea that it is in their dominion. Only last year we claimed the island for the United States under the Guano Island Act, raising an American flag flying high and proud over the island. William Parker and R. F. Ryan chartered the schooner Palestine, found the island, and reported it to us the previous year. Merchants and seafarers write that the flag has been torn down and replaced with the flag of the Hawaiian Kingdom. An envoy should be sent as soon as possible to replace the flag."
 usa.274.t: "Johnston Atoll American Flag and Annexation"
 usa.274.d: "Mr. President! We've received news that the schooner, Palestine, has returned to the island to raise the American Flag once again. Two crew members stayed on the island to gather samples of phosphate from local rocks lying around, as the ship stays close to the island. On this same day, a declaration of the annexation of the island has reached the US from Hawaii, where King Kamehameha IV has declared the island within the dominion of his kingdom. He will soon regret his decision, as he revokes the annexation, receiving news that we have claimed it, but continues to believe the island in his territory."

 usa_news.1.d: "As 1858 rolls around, Congressional Positions are tossed up to the state elections. One particular election was the Senate Election in Illinois. Democratic Senator Stephen Douglas sought re-election in Illinois, but he was challenged by a politician named Abraham Lincoln. Famously, Abraham delivered his \"House Divided\" speech, and exemplified the disunity that Slavery has brought to the nation. \n \nAlthough Lincoln would lose and Stephen would get another term as Senator, the Lincoln-Douglas debates brought him nationwide attention."

 usa_news.2.d: "The issue of slavery has been debated in Politics for a while now, but now Political Parties are getting more involved in the slavery debate. \n \nThe Republican Party has announced that they have nominated Illinois politician Abraham Lincoln, who wishes for slavery to not expand West. The Southern Democrats have elected John Breckinridge, current Vice President under Buchanan, who supports expansion of slavery into the west, while the Northern Democrats chose Stephen Douglas as a moderate on the issue. Outside of these parties, the Constitutional Union Party is led by John Bell, who aims his Presidency on healing the country after a decade of debating over slavery."

 acw.27.d: "For too long, the white men have oppressed us, fought us, and denied us. They hold our ancestral lands of Minnesota and most parts of Dakota. They claim to have diplomatic relations with us, and yet they attack us at every opportunity, and refuse every treaty that does not grant them full power over us. Now, however, is an opportunity. They are embroiled in a war against themselves, and if we can push forward, we can recapture our former territories.

 acw.33.d_a: "We have been able to successfully push the Sioux back! Now we are at an impasse. Should we settle this dispute and offer peace, or should we punish the Sioux for their aggression against us?"
 acw.33.a: "That is enough war for now."
 acw.33.b: "There must be consequences!"
 acw.34.t: "The Dakota War"
 acw.34.d: "The people of the Sioux have recently been launching skirmishes at Union garrisons in South Dakota!

 acw.34.d_a: "The people of the Sioux have recently announced that they have officially declared war upon us! They have launched campaigns into our territories in the North, attacking people and garrisons alike!

 acw.41.t: "Question of Monroe"
 acw.41.d: "We have engaged in a civil war against ourselves, and in order to win we must bring everything we have toward defeating the Confederate traitors.

 acw.42.t: "Restoring the Monroe Doctrine"
 acw.42.d: "Now that the Civil War is over, we must begin to think about reestablishing the Monroe Doctrine, since Mexico suffered a French invasion because we could not intervene. However, if we are to truly reestablish Americana, we must declare the Monroe Doctrine to be in full effect again."

However, Lincoln refused to join because of the coup, and the House of Representatives eventually elected John C Frémont.\n \nAfter this, Congress quickly pushed for the Equality Act of [GetYear], and was accepted by the President. This has sparked outrage across the Union, and many slave states are threatening to leave the Union because of this."
 acw.45.a: "Pass the Act!"
 acw.46.t: "The American Civil War"
 acw.46.d: "\"It is time, the pieces are in their place. This day, will be the day that we shall remember forever, the day in which we as Americans rose against the evils of the world, and so proudly triumph over it. We may bleed from Pennsylvania to California, and though the Mississippi shall turn red, we shall fight for the rights of those who were oppressed for so long.

Now, it is time for the grand parade in Washington D.C. \n \nOur soldiers marched down the streets of Washington D.C., and they have been met by cheering crowds. As they reached the Capitol building, John Bell stepped up the stairs.

 acw.48.d: "Now that we have assumed the position of the United States, we have begun to resume diplomatic relations with nations across the World.

 acw.49.d_offer: "We have received a message from the Yankees, who have finally pulled themselves together after their Civil War. John Bell had won, and is asking if we would like to rejoin the Union!"

 acw.52.t: "Rise of Norton"
 acw.52.d: "As a result of the current chaos that has overtaken our nation, a new challenge to our authority arises in the West. Joshua Norton, who proclaimed himself as Emperor of the United States back in 1859, has risen a militia across the state of California. The National Guard of California, which had mutinied against our officers, joined him and has helped turn him into a legitimate threat against our nation. \n \nNorton had issued an ultimatum for the other splinter nations to surrender, and to grant him a coronation in Washington, DC. None have taken this demand seriously, but the threat that America could be ruled by Kings again worries many."
 acw.52.a: "Join, or Die!"
 acw.52.b: "Long Live the King!"
 acw.53.t: "The Manhattan Commune"
 acw.53.d: "As a result of the current chaos that has overtaken our nation, a new challenge to our authority arises in the East. Josiah Warren, who has led the community of Modern Times since 1851, has declared an emergency rising of militiamen across Long Island, New York. The Community had held a grudge against the Government since they placed their restriction on their commerce. \n \nJosiah, although still a believer in economics, has let socialists and communists rise in his community in order to gain power and influence. Now, he has used this influence to take the city of New York from us! Although his influence is smaller than the other splinter states, they have taken control of one of the most important cities in the United States."
 acw.53.a: "Laughable!"
 acw.53.b: "For a Utopia!"
# acw.54.t:0 "Rebellion in New England"
# acw.54.d:0 "The Abolitionist fervor that had chased Breckinridge has reached a turning point in New England today, after news from Washington of John Bell's intentions to past legislation to prosecute  many well-known radical Abolitionists including congressman John C. Fremont in hopes of gaining the trusts of the South. \n \n'There are dangers to the legal persecution of political rivals,' Maine Senator Hannibal Hamlin stated in a briefing. It has been made clear that a government in Washington, no matter which party, could be trusted to instill the Rights of Men. A second revolution must occur.` \n \nThe Abolitionist rebels have been able to establish a foothold in New England and it will only be a matter of time before the rebellion becomes out of our control, lest we address it immediately."

However, reports have come in stating that Union Forces stormed the City of New Orleans. \n \nNew Orleans, on the Mouth of the Mississippi, is extremely vital as not only a means of transportation, but also as a connection between the Eastern and the Western ends of the Confederacy. This made the river a High Priority for Union forces, who attacked and were able to take over New Orleans, as well take control of the Mississippi River, effectively cutting the Confederacy in half. \n \nThe Confederacy reels from the major blow of this loss, while the Union celebrates."

The Union forces eagerly followed and beseiged the Fort, similar to how the Confederates did the same thing during the beginning of the war.

 acw_generic.134.d_a: "After the Trent Affair, the British people had demanded that the Government act in response to the defiance that the Americans have shown. In turn, the British Parliament sent a delegation to the United States which demanded that the Diplomats be released.
