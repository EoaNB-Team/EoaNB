The letter delivered in person by the bravest diplomat they could find, was a notification to the united states that the government here would be formalizing it's nationhood, and requesting that they respect, among other things, the rights to a solid border and the rights to the resources.\n\nThe usual suspects in power immediately crawled out of the woodwork, with optimists naively hoping for the best and the more cynical expecting to have the U.S. senate laugh until the passed out. It was like a mouse asking a lion to respect it's boundaries, while the lion simply wondered why it's lunch was talking to him."
 NA_N_event.2.a: "If we persuade congress we can get these treaties passed."
 NA_N_event.2.b: "Let congress decide."
 
 NA_N_event.3.d: "Out of the inky black pit of the American psyche, a spark of goodness has risen. Graciously, the U.S. senate sent their agreement in the hands of Senator Seward, and the formally agreed to respect the boundaries of our nation.\n\nThis was a momentous occasion, as it was the first time that a senator had set foot on our lands. When the New-York Senator arrived, many commented that that the Americans saw fit to legislate on us without even being there, but these people were told to shut up quickly before they compromised a delicate situation."
 
 NA_N_event.4.d: "The response from the U.S. was clear: giggling contempt. Total gleeful derision of a very reasonable request. We thought it out for weeks, but it seems that the voices of optimism have been silenced and the cynics have the floor.\n\nHowever, our response is ready, and our stance is resolute. If the settlers will not leave on their own accord, then the army is willing to make them leave on the ends of bayonets. Even now, recruitment has opened, and new troops train, ready for the inevitable American outrage at this."
 
 NA_N_event.5.t: "Settlers Evicted!"
 NA_N_event.5.d: "When the settlers came, they hunted here too. The elders said that they over-hunted, even in the wrong season, and that the land was not meant to be treated this way. Arni told me stories about the things he'd seen these settlers do. he spoke for a long time about finding mountains of dead buffalo, left to waste, and tracks of steel cutting up ancestral sites. Yesterday. something bad happened. One of the boys was found dead not far from outside the village. His mother wouldn't stop crying. It was an unenviable waste of life, and we watched as it slipped away. And on the horizon, we saw whit men on horses with wide hats riding away. Today, at midday, the messenger we sent out came back with the militia reinforcements we requested. They said that the high council had put out a mandate for the white man's removal from these lands. The elders of our village told them want happened, and told them where the settler lived. The militia marched out at dusk."

 NA_N_event.7.t: "Settlers Evicted from [FROM.GetAdjective] Territories!"
 NA_N_event.7.d: "A flood of settlers came to a town in [FROM.GetName] after [FROM.FROM.GetName] evicted them from [FROM.FROM.FROM.GetName]. One settler described this incident in a letter sent to his mother:\n\nThe road to this land was long and hard. We walked and rode through the territories for long hours during the day and slept in cold wagons in at night. It was a difficult way of life, but not as difficult as turning around and going back.\n\nSee, the man who sold us the land told us that the natives weren't anything to worry about, they were a bunch of backwards savages. Turns out they weren't dull alcoholics, they were cold men in uniforms with sharp bayonets, and they really didn't want us there. It was dusk when the men from the local camp came to our little boom-town. They came in number, with rifles and pistols, and they told us that we had until sunrise the next day to pack our things and head east. Old Paulie tried to fight back, and they shot him on the spot. That night, the men of the town formed a posse and went to take it up with the natives where they lives, assuming they'd gone back to their tepees. They didn't know that the natives never left. They didn't expect to be surrounded. When the dust cleared and the final shot echoed off the plains, we did as they said. We packed what little we had and left. I just thank god that my father didn't go with the posse that night."

 NA_N_event.9.t: "The Slavery Debate"
 NA_N_event.9.d: "The matter of slaves is a debated issue here, but not as debated as in the American state. Our attitude to slavery and the position of slaves in society is very different to that of the Americans, with many commentators currently documenting our ways. One of the ways that we differ is that the principles used to justify slavery is not as present, making it much less socially entrenched. This means that we could easily undo the negative social effects of this practice with some choice legislation. However, there are some who want to retain this, out of a push for westernization and control over the slave classes."

 NA_N_event.10.d: "There is nothing more sacred to our people than tradition. We live and breathe it. To maintain this is to keep a firm hold on our own self-identity, and in politics this is no different. Self identity and national spirit are important and valuable things to a people, for without these long standing traditions of spirits and men, we would be nothing. We, the native people of this land, hold dear these things that the colonial invader has sought to destroy. It is out perpetual creed."

Polished rifles with sharp bayonets. The developing capital is being introduced to a new and revolutionary concept: a military parade and rally. Lines of soldiers march in front of a crowd of people, and the high chief watches from above. The nation has grown a self-image where the natural calm and collected nature has become a cold, calculating ruthlessness."

We burnt their clothes and their trinkets, and other possessions. My friend asked his mother what happened to the counsellors. She said it was best he didn't know. Sometimes, I still see the fire, the night we burnt the old ways to the ground. I think we lost something in there that night. We sacrificed a part of ourselves to the fire, for the right to stay alive."

 NA_N_event.13.d: "When we signed it into law, we immediately got an angry letter from the Congress of the United States. It was very funny to read, got a lot of laughs around the offices. Apparently, the formation of a 'Constitutional Monarchy' was an overall rejection of freedom, some more bluster about the resemblance to the British system (which doesn't really count for much, we can't see it and we wrote the thing) and the ominous threat of 'negative diplomatic relations'.That last bit got some serious laughs from a few people."

 NA_N_event.14.d: "Yesterday, the man next door did something odd: he finished building a house. It was a simple thing, made from a kit left behind by settlers, but it was a solid house. There were more of them nowadays, popping up along dirt roads. Some of the busier roads were paved now. The next day, the sun rose differently. It was a sunrise seen a thousand times by many, but it shone on a changed land. A few towns over, a railway that headed to the capital was being built. It was like, all of a sudden, the land has surrendered part of it's spirit. Factories became more common now. They sprung up everywhere, so did shops and telegraph offices. It was like, on a walk through the new 'town', you could feel the spirit falling from the land like ashes from a cigarette. But this change, gave a certain momentum to matters, one that struck fear into the hearts of the American settlers. It lit up the darkest parts of the American psyche with the shocking realization that civilization is not the sole preserve of the white man, and that with enough time, the indigenous populations are perfectly capable of posing a threat of their own."

 NA_N_event.58.d: "On the crossroads in town, some industrious fellow had built a theatre. A remarkable achievement, it was small but then again so was the village. Our population grew smaller by the day. The elders told us that the settlers from the east brought evil spirits, disease. Every week or so we received word of more dead buffalo, left to rot. Slaughtered for their iron roads. Me and my sister bought a ticket each to tonight's showing. It was bad, but it was the kind of bad that just made it fun to watch. We sat in the second row from the front and watched as the actors in cheap costumes began their stilted and awkward opening lines. It was always funny when they screwed up, and it got a few solid laughs. We were halfway through the second act when the town bell rang in alarm. In the distance, the was a loud boom, and then it happened. An American cannonball crashed through the theatre roof, sending splinters of wood and shrapnel flying and filling the air with smoke and dust. There was a crazy rush as the bell rang louder and the cries of attack filled the air. People screamed as they stampeded for the exit. I could hear my sister shouting for me in the chaos. That was the last time I heard her alive. They found her body under the rubble when the dust had settled. The cycle of encroachment and raid had finally given way to war, a war that I would be called up to fight in."

 NA_N_event.59.d: "They died for what? Land? Gold? Weapons? Whatever was in the bag, it had damned an entire nation to brutal bloodshed. The raids, and the encroachment, the road leading here was long and hard and perilous. Hare only stumbled on the cabin where it all began by accident, after he had been separated from his war party. The shack was dark, and dimly lit, but there was still oil in the lamp. Someone was here recently. Around the table there were 3 dead bodies. Two confederate officers, and a Comanche. It was obvious what happened. They shot each other, over the bag on the table. As hare approached the table, gunfire ripped through the cabin. The cheap and old wood splintered into toothpicks as he hit the floor. He could hear the strong accents of Texans outside. The confederate line had retreated and they were burning everything along the way. A stray bullet knocked the lamp off the side, spilling hot oil that burst into flames as it touched the wick. Soon, the entire shack was engulfed with flames and smoke filled the air. It was getting harder and harder to breathe, as the roof started to creak, and the lack of escape was obvious. Hare, slowly coughing, opened the bag on the table. What was it, that caused all of this? What could be so important that it would form the final spark that ignited a powder keg? It was money. Confederate-issued dollars. This...this was worthless. Worthless paper issued by worthless men to trade in worthless cotton. This war, though the product of a long road, certainly was a disappointing destination. Hare sighed. And then the roof collapsed in on him."

When they came bearing crosses, we saw through their falsehoods of prophecy and sermon. They came to convert us, the godless heathens, they claimed. They came to convert alright, convert our gold into money. As for their god, even the other white men think they're crazed fanatics. But, this cycle has turned for many a year.

Some bring back drawings that cause nightmares. The scars aswell cause concern, so it is obvious that many would resist, and resist they did. Soon, the colonists returned with soldiers to take them by force. Locals didn't like that. They returned fire. Now we have what is often referred to as a 'bit of a pisser', in the form of a war with Canada."
