 BRA_imperial_army_desc: "The Army of the Empire of Brazil is one of the most formidable land forces in the American continent. It was first organized in the War of Independence in September 1822, mainly by old Luso-Brazilian troops which stayed in the mainland and joined the cause of Dom Pedro I. It emerged victorious from the skirmishes against the Portuguese troops and by 1824 the war was over. Since then, the army went through many conflicts, including the Cisplatina War and, most recently, the Platine War. Following the end of the Platine War, the army's state started to decay, the number of troops decreased, and the lack of equipment and modernization became clear. If we expect to emerge victorious in future conflicts and secure our interests, the army needs to be modernized, rearmed and become the strongest in South America!"
 BRA_imperial_navy: "Armada Imperial Brasileira"
 BRA_imperial_navy_desc: "The Brazilian Armada is among the strongest fleets in the entire globe. Born in the struggle of Independence in 1822, the navy quickly assembled itself in order to protect the mainland from further Portuguese aggression. With the war concluded in 1825, the navy would be of key importance in securing the Empire's interests in the Platine Basin, being of key importance in the wars fought in the region. The navy needs to grow larger and stronger to maintain the status quo achieved in the Platine War, and to protect the lands of the Empire from outside aggression. However, the Empire currently does not sustain the capabilities to produce ships, forcing us to acquire new vessels from foreigners, such as the British and the French. If we want to make sure Brazil rules the waves, we must allocate new funds, and modernize and expand our fleet!"

The crew returned and they were murdered by the same looters, who escaped to Uruguay and other provinces. Foreign minister Earl Russell found out about the case and realized that it only happened due to the incompetence of the Brazilian authorities. He could not find all the results and decided to talk with William Dougal Christie, who decided to send two ships to investigate himself and talk with the local provincial president. An agreement could not be found and the loot and murders are still unsolved."

 brazil.33.t: "Brazil responds to our demands!"
 brazil.33.d: "The Brazilian Emperor has told our ambassador William Dougal Christie that he should wait for their ministry of justice to analyze the evidences and solve the case. The reparations will not be given and tensions have rose due to that."

He was stopped by a marine, who was already enraged at the British drunk The British Marine in the area heard about the imprisonment and decided to intervene, judging the fact that the police were not imprisoning. The Brazilian marines were unrighteous and disrespectful.

 brazil.34.a: "Another crisis with Britain? They are becoming a problem.."
 brazil.34.b: "What an inequitable action! Demand that our men be judged by the British court."
 brazil.35.t: "Britain demands their men be judged by their own court."
 brazil.35.d: "After the imprisonment of the British marines, William Dougal Christie has demanded that their men be judged in England and not in the 'unfair' courts of Brazil. Antônio Coelho de Sá and Albuquerque sent a diplomatic note to the British ambassador requesting that those responsible for the incident be made available to the national authorities. The procedure is necessary because the British subjects only respond to the courts of their country."
 brazil.35.a: "This will be solved in Brazilian soil!"
 brazil.36.t: "Brazil rejects our demands!"
 brazil.36.d: "The Brazilian Ambassador Antônio Coelho de Sá and Albuquerque requested that our government does not intervene in the judgement of the unfairly imprisoned marines. This is outrageous and William Dougal Christie has announced that he plans to threaten the Brazilian government to act about this case and the past case from the Prince of Wales. Our nation is mostly certain that we should send a powerful threat to those savages!"

 brazil.36.b: "They're right, we should back away."
 brazil.37.t: "The United Kingdom sends an ultimatum!"
 brazil.37.d: "William Dougal Christie has told our Emperor that if the reparations from The Prince of Wales loot was not paid, if the Brazilian marines were involved in the bar fight were not imprisoned, if the policeman that imprisoned the marines were not demoted and if Brazil did not send a formal apology to the United Kingdom: the royal navy would blockade Rio de Janeiro and the Guanabara Bay. This is a threat to our nation that is an immense stab at our nationalistic pride! The British seem to have no respect for Brazil."
 brazil.37.a: "Tell them that the Empire of Brazil is ready for war."
 brazil.38.t: "Britain backs down"
 brazil.38.d: "Noticing that we were on the right side, the british have backed down and decided that we should judge the marines. This puts an end to the instability in our nation as the crisis is finally over."
 brazil.38.a: "Amazing!"
 brazil.39.t: "The Empire of Brazil rejects our ultimatum!"
 brazil.39.d: "The Empire of Brazil has rejected our ultimatum that was sent by William Dougal Christie. Their emperor has taken our words that we would block the port of the city of Rio de Janeiro personally to his nation and he has decided to utter words that truly impressed the entire british embassy! After hearing our ultimatum, the emperor of Brazil proudly said that \n\n'The Empire of Brazil is ready for war.' /nIt seems that this was a foolish action, as our royal navy is immediately ready to threaten them! We shall get justice for our marines and reparations for the Prince of Wales! Britain will not back down!"
 brazil.39.a: "Blockade the Bay! Those Brazilians will see! Demand our reparations now!"
 brazil.40.t: "The British Navy blockades our bay!"

This infuriated our capital, as this is an act of disrespect and is violating our national waters and territories. It is our emperor choice if he will rally the people against this act or if he will desist. The fate of Brazil is uncertain!"
 brazil.40.a: "Rally the people! We will shatter relations with the British and demand the return of our ships!."
 brazil.40.b: "It is time to pay them.."
 brazil.41.t: "Brazil refuses to pay and ceases diplomatic relations!"
 brazil.41.d: "The Empire of Brazil has rallied their citizens and decided that they shall not bow to us. This foolish act was met with our blockade leaving to recover in Saint Helena and them deciding to demand that we return our ships and give a formal apology. We may not be able to afford a war with the Brazilian navy but if it is necessary to teach them a lesson, we shall shatter their ignorance towards our power! It is our decision to choose if we end this in a diplomatic standoff or an all-out conflict."
 brazil.41.a: "Let us solve this diplomatically. They'll pay us anyways."
 brazil.41.b: "This means war! This insubordination will be met with cannons!"
 brazil.42.t: "The British retreat to Saint Helena for peace"
 brazil.42.d: "The British navy, with our captured ships, has retreated to Saint Helena. It seems that they want peace instead of an all-out war, our diplomats in London are gathering to demand them to pay us our reparations. The situation is divisive and may need foreign support."
 brazil.42.a: "Ask for the international consulate of justice to judge this case."
 brazil.43.t: "Brazil demands that the international consulate judges our crisis"
 brazil.43.d: "The Brazilian diplomats still in London have demanded that the international justice deals with the Christie Question. We were running short on options and it seems that diplomacy was impossible, but King Leopold I of Belgium, uncle of our Queen Victoria and our ally, has offered himself to judge our case."
 brazil.43.a: "Leopold shall judge the case!"
 brazil.44.t: "Judging The Christie Question"
 brazil.44.d: "Our King, Leopold I, has offered his support to judge the Christie Question, the crisis between Brazil and Britain. We have to remember that Britain is our ally since the beggining, our family is related to theirs and they supported us industrialize. In the other hand, this crisis seems like Britain is violating Brazil's sovereignity and our ambassadors have made great progress in trying to ally Brazil, losing their support would be a waste of diplomacy."

 brazil.44.b: "Side with Britain."
 brazil.45.t: "Leopold sides with Brazil"

 brazil.46.t: "Leopold sides with Britain"
 brazil.46.d: "King Leopold of Belgium, as expected by the British royals, has sided with his family and decided that Britain is on the right side. He states that Brazil should pay reparations and Britain should not be punished for their reaction."

 brazil.46.b: "A terrible outcome."
 brazil.47.t: "Britain offers to compromise."
 brazil.47.d: "The British Empire has offered to compromise once again with better terms but they still want us to pay reparations for the incidents that were not our fault. They may be more diplomatic now, but it is still an unfair treaty."
 brazil.47.a: "Reject it."
 brazil.48.t: "Britain offers to compromise."
 brazil.48.d: "The British Empire has offered to compromise once again with terrible terms. They still want us to pay reparations for the incidents that were not our fault. They have gained Belgium support and this is still an unfair treaty even after the international court's judgement."
 brazil.48.a: "Reject it."
 brazil.49.t: "Solving the Crisis with Brazil"
 brazil.49.d: "Our relations with Brazil have been damaged for long enough. We have to solve this by sending Sir Edward Thornton for our best offers to Brazil. They will be pressured by the fact that this crisis has dealt instability to them and we will reconcile with a possible ally once again.

 brazil.52.t: "Solving the Crisis with Britain"
 brazil.52.d: "Our Marquis of Olinda, Pedro Araújo Lima has had talks with Sir Edward Thornton and they have come to necessary terms as Brazil will pay reparations to Britain.

 brazil.53.t: "Reconciliation with Brazil"
 brazil.53.d: "The Empire of Brazil has paid us our reparations, but due to the results of the international court's judgement by Leopold, we have to send them a formal apology.

 brazil.62.d: "On January 1, 1857, the opening chapter of the novel called The Guarany: the Brazilian Novel was published in the Diary of Rio de Janeiro, in the form of a feuilleton. \nThe historical novel, written by José Martiniano de Alencar, takes place over two hundred years ago, during the Brazilian colonial period, when Brazil was under Portuguese rule. \nThe novel tells a story of love and adventure. \nIn a setting that is a true tropical paradise, close to lush forests, lives Cecília de Mariz, the beautiful protagonist of the novel. The girl has white skin, is blonde and has blue eyes. She is the daughter of a Portuguese nobleman, and lives an aristocratic, almost princely life, and is very protected by her family. \nThe protagonist of the novel is Peri, a tall, strong and kind-hearted Guarani Indian. He has a real adoration for the girl, and the two are very good friends. But a series of events puts Cecília and Peri's lives in danger. \nJosé de Alencar, the novel's writer, extols: Brazilian nationalism through the idealization of indigenous traditions, portraying the Indian as a mythical national hero, influenced mainly by medieval romanticism; the appreciation of nature, extolling the exuberance of Brazilian biomes; and the distance from the Portuguese, the former colonizers of the Brazilian people.\nSince independence, the Empire of Brazil has faced separatist revolts of the most diverse natures, mainly due to the strong sense of regionalism of the population.\nAnd the incorporation of indigenous traditions and values ​​to Brazilian national values, can help solidify the sense of belonging to the Empire of Brazil, replacing regional values, thus strengthening Brazilian nationalism."

 brazil.foreign.1.d: "In October 1861, the new Representative Minister of the United States of America in Brazil, James Watson Webb, disembarked in Rio de Janeiro. The exchange is due to the fact that the previous American minister, Richard Kidder Meade Jr., extremely popular in Brazil, became an ally of the Confederate States of America, a country with which the states are in a state of Civil War. One of the new minister's missions is to get political support in Brazil to stop any aid and close the ports to the Confederates."

It is customary for diplomats to introduce themselves to [BRA.GetLeader], before taking office, in the protocol the foreign minister must previously submit the presentation speech to the Ministry of State for Foreign Affairs. The Minister of Foreign Affairs Benevenuto Tacques, considered the content of the text can be embarrassing to the Emperor in a public hearing."

In addition to embarrassing the Imperial Court with its rude and "sour" behavior, the minister showed little interest in following the correct protocols for the presentation. It lasted longer than usual, showed little knowledge of the laws of Brazil and did not even try to learn Portuguese."
 brazil.foreign.3.d_USA: "The presentation speech by our Minister in Brazil, James Webb, received a disastrous reception. Webb did not bother to follow the usual protocols for the presentation speeches at the Court, he took more time than usual in the presentation, he did not seek to know about the local legislation and went further by behaving rudely and "sour" to [BRA.GetLeader] and the Court of Brazil."

 brazil.foreign.4.t: "Minister James Webb's speech was vetoed"

In a context of Civil War, Tacques felt that the topic was inappropriate for a public audience. After due corrections, a private hearing can be held later."
 brazil.foreign.4.d_USA: "The performance of our Minister in Brazil has not been the best, James Webb was unable to approve his speech to a public audience with [BRA.GetLeader] (Pedro II), as the content of the document was considered embarrassing by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, Benevenuto Tacques.

 brazil.foreign.5.d: "In a short time, the speech of Minister James Webb became the most talked about subject in the Brazilian court. And although most of the comments refer to the American decorum's breach of decorum in his presentation, the speech serves as a theme for political reflection and debate on the abolition of slavery and the possible benefits of free labor by the black population."
 brazil.foreign.5.a: "This is not good!"
 brazil.foreign.6.t: "Correction of Minister James Webb's Speech"
 brazil.foreign.6.d: "After three weeks of attempted corrections, much to the chagrin of Minister James Webb, who considered the censorship of Minister of State Benevenuto Tacques to be an affront, Webb's reasoning was published without the controversy regarding slavery or the internal conflict in the USA."

 brazil.foreign.7.d_USA: "Our minister, Brazil, James Webb, requested the publication of the complete version of his speech to the Washington State Department and in some New York newspapers, as he believes that censoring his speech was detrimental to his convictions . Our relations with Brazil are low at the moment and it is not wise to allow publication when it has been denied in Brazil."

 brazil.foreign.7.b: "We will not allow this publication"
 brazil.foreign.8.t: "Minister James Webb protests Brazil's neutrality"
 brazil.foreign.8.d: "Brazil's official position regarding the American Civil War is one of complete neutrality. It recognizes the Confederate States of America with belligerent status, although it does not recognize its existence politically, it does not refuse the right to belligerent. However, Minister James Webb daily sends aggressive complaints about the supply of Confederate ships off the Brazilian coast. Webb believes that the Confederates, because they are not a nation, should not be recognized diplomatically and that their vessels should be considered as pirates."
 brazil.foreign.8.d_USA: "Our Minister in Brazil James Web, struggles to change the position of the Brazilian Empire's Neutrality in relation to the American Civil War. Although the leaders of Brazil do not recognize the existence of the Confederates politically, they recognize them with the status of belligerents, and consequently with all the rights that this status has, allowing supply and trade with the Confederates.

 brazil.foreign.10.d: "Brazil's official position in relation to the American Civil War is in support of the Confederates. Brazil politically recognizes the Confederate States of America as a sovereign nation, albeit with a belligerent status and due to characteristics shared by both nations, relations and trade between Brazil and the Confederates will greatly increase. Minister James Webb publicly condemned any support given to the Confederates. According to him, the Confederates should not be recognized as a nation and their vessels should be considered pirates."
 brazil.foreign.10.d_USA: "Our Minister in Brazil James Webb, condemns Brazil's approach to the Confederates in relation to the American Civil War. Brazil politically recognizes the Confederate States of America as a sovereign nation, although with belligerent status and due to characteristics shared by the two nations, relations and trade between Brazil and the Confederates will greatly increase. The Minister fears that this approach will be the beginning of an alliance between Brazil and the Confederate States of America, which would be disastrous for our nation. Minister James Webb struggles to change the position of Brazil, for him the Confederates should not be recognized as a nation and their vessels should be considered pirates."
 brazil.foreign.10.d_CSA: "The Empire of Brazil has shown support for our cause. Due to the similarities in the characteristics of our nations, the rapprochement between the Brazilian Empire and the Confederate States of America is a natural movement. We must cultivate this support to the maximum, because in the future we can obtain an alliance. Yankees Minister James Webb, successively tries to undermine our cause in Brazil, but according to our supporter, Richard Kidder Meade Jr, who was US Minister in Brazil before the Civil War, he will not succeed in getting support in Brazil."

 brazil.foreign.11.d: "On May 10, 1857, the American minister James Webb, presented to the Marquis de Abrantes, current Minister of State, a proposal for the opening of a binational company for colonization and rural exploration of the Amazon basin by African Americans. Webb argues that the lack of workers in the “northern provinces” is the result of a process of intensifying internal trafficking that transfers all the slave labor to the “southern provinces”, where the large coffee plantations are located. The “northern provinces” are at serious risk of seeing themselves “again” in a situation of barbarism, as they are almost exclusively inhabited by Indians. In order to solve this chronic problem of lack of manpower, it is necessary to transfer African-American workers, who are more adaptable to the soil and tropical climate. These free and paid African-American workers will be responsible for developing the region's resources and infrastructure, they will be under a two to five year employment contract, during which time they must pay the costs of their transportation. After the end of this contract, the worker will receive Brazilian citizenship and a piece of land, thus guaranteeing his interest in staying and developing the region. The Binational Company of colonization of the Amazon basin will be responsible for the supply of labor and for the management of the works carried out in the northern region, while the Empire of Brazil is responsible for giving up the land for development. The United States is ready to immediately invest 10,000 to 50,000 trained and educated workers at no cost to the Empire of Brazil."

 brazil.foreign.12.t: "Minister of Foreign Affairs begins the analysis of the proposal for colonization of the Amazon Basin."
 brazil.foreign.12.d: "The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Calmon du Pin e Almeida, Marquis of Abrantes, says that the proposal for colonization of the Amazon Basin by the American Minister James Webb, must be analyzed very carefully. The USA has a history of interventionism in foreign territories with American settlers, taking as a striking example the region of Texas that belonged to Mexico. After these settlers' discontent with the local administration, the US openly supported the secession of this region by placing it under its influence zone and subsequently annexing the territory. Although intervention in South America is less likely, it is not impossible to carry out, linked to old documents about Destiny Manifesto, dated 1850, in which Matthew Fontaine Maury, head of the Naval Observatory, proposes a plan for the occupation of the Amazon starting with the settlement of American slaves to "develop" the resources of the region and later taking it by force.

 brazil.minister.actions.0.d: "Pedro de Araújo Lima, the Marquis of Olinda, was appointed as President of the Council of Ministers in May 1857 by Emperor Dom Pedro II, being scrutinized by the General Assembly of the Empire of Brazil shortly thereafter. In 1837, Pedro de Araújo Lima was one of the founders of the first national political association, the party of order. The party of order, also called regressist, is the direct successor of the Restoration Party, also called Caramuru, being formed from the union of the latter with dissidents of the Moderate Liberal Party, also called Ximangos, and had as its political objective the fight against liberal measures taken during the Regency of Diogo Antônio Feijó, popularly known as Father Feijó. Later the Party of Order adopted the name of the Conservative Party. In September 1837, with the resignation of the acting Regent Diogo Antônio Feijó, Pedro de Araújo Lima was elected Regent of the Empire of Brazil, after a fierce dispute with the liberal candidate, Antônio de Holanda Cavalcanti, and governed the country in the name of Dom Pedro II, who was 12 years old. During his regency, he implemented the policies of the regressive movement by editing in 1840 the Law of Interpretation of the Additional Act, which reversed the liberal measures adopted since 1834. During the regency period in Brazil, unemployment, large estates and the excessive power of large landowners provoked numerous uprisings, such as the Farroupilha, a separatist revolt in the provinces of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, the Sabinada, a revolt in the province of Bahia, and the Cabanagem, a revolt in the province of Pará. Pedro de Araújo Lima faced the revolts with repression and strengthened the central government.\n	   In retaliation against the Conservative Party, on July 23, 1840, the Liberal Party, created from the union of the Exalted Liberal Party and the Moderate Liberal Party, engineered the Majority Coup, where Pedro II took the throne at 15 and Pedro de Araújo Lima, was removed from the Regency. Despite this, during the coronation of Pedro II in 1841, Pedro de Araújo Lima received the noble title of Viscount of Olinda. And in 1842 he was appointed Minister of the Council of State.\n	In 1848, with the victory of the Conservatives in the provincial elections, the Viscount of Olinda was appointed President of the Council of Ministers, a position created in July 1847 to head the State Council of Ministers. During this period Olinda appointed the deputy from Pará Herculano Pena as President of the province of Pernambuco. The response to this appointment was the beginning of an uprising in the province of Pernambuco, called the Praieira Revolution.\n	In 1854, Pedro de Araújo Lima was elevated from viscount to marquis. With the experience of the Marquis of Olinda, the Empire of Brazil will achieve prosperity."
