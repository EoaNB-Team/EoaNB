 asa_mcclellan_declares_himself_emperor.1.desc:0 "Days ago, George B. McClellan gave a speech from the White House where he proclaimed himself "Emperor of America" and "Protector of Canada." Shortly after, a bill in Congress was passed giving McClellan total legislative and executive power before all of Congress's legislators went home. An hour after that, the A.S. Supreme Court gave up all judicial power to the general. By the end of the day, the new [ASA.GetName] was firmly established with Emperor George I as its leader.\n \nThis move came as a sock to both the rest of the former United States and the world as America had always held a staunch anti-monarchy position. It's doubtless that [GRL.GetAdjective] and [NEG.GetAdjective] politicians and military officials are concerned about the new developments and will most likely try to directly intervene against the general."

 # ASA Offers Tariff Removal To GRL #
 asa_ga_intracontinental_affairs_committee.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Offers To Lift Tariffs On Our Fish"
 asa_ga_intracontinental_affairs_committee.5.desc:0 "A delegate from [ASA.GetNameDef] has proposed an interesting offer for us. In exchange for us joining their newly planned continental alliance, they will lift tariffs off of most of our key exports, namely fish. While accepting this would massively improve the economy by opening us up to a new market with hundreds of thousands of possible consumers, some of our cabinet worry that joining this alliance will be reducing our own sovereignty. How should we respond to [ASA.GetNameDef]?"
 asa_ga_intracontinental_affairs_committee.5.a:0 "This is a beneficial endeavor"
 asa_ga_intracontinental_affairs_committee.5.b:0 "This seems suspicious"
 # ASA Asks For Concessions From GRL #
 asa_ga_intracontinental_affairs_committee.6.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Concessions"
 asa_ga_intracontinental_affairs_committee.6.desc:0 "A delegate from [ASA.GetNameDef] has come to our capital and delivered a letter stating that if we make concessions to [ASA.GetNameDef], they would approve of our membership in a new alliance they're building. While these concessions would be humiliating and harmful, some wonder if refusing these would just result in an invasion with the same outcome but worse for us."
 asa_ga_intracontinental_affairs_committee.6.a:0 "We have no choice"
 asa_ga_intracontinental_affairs_committee.6.b:0 "Never!"
