 #STARTING EVENTS
 austria.1.t: "State and City Names: English or German?"
 austria.1.d: "This mod gives you the option of playing with the German names for the states and cities currently under your control. Do you want to enable this?"
 austria.1.a: "Yes, I want German names in the Austrian Empire."
 austria.1.b: "Yes, and also rename states and cities in all of Germany."
 austria.1.c: "No, keep it in English."
 AUS_event_austria_rename_effect_tt: "§YStates§! and §Ycities§! in the §YAustrian Empire§! will be renamed to their §YGerman§! names."
 austria.2.t: "[AUS.GetNameDef] - Starting Situation"
 austria.2.d: "In spite of the recent setbacks our Empire had to endure, it still stands stoic against the sands of time, in large part thanks to the unparalleled leadership of our great monarch, Emperor Franz Joseph I. The young Emperor assumed the throne at just 18 years of age in December 1848, after his uncle Ferdinand I abdicated and his father refused to take the throne amidst the ongoing revolutionary events that swept the continent. Shortly thereafter, the Emperor secured the support of Czar Nicholas I against the Hungarian revolutionaries, and a pact was formed between Vienna and St. Petersburg, eventually securing the continued integrity of the Austrian Empire. This cooperation was intensified in 1850, when Austria, with the outspoken support of the Russian Empire, was able to force the Kingdom of Prussia to forfeit their plans to form a more unified German state in the Punctation of Olmütz. The moral obligation to return the favor, however, was repeatedly neglected by the Austrian authorities prior, during, and after the events sorrounding the Crimean War, with dire consequences for the Austro- Russian relationship and the reputation of the Austrian diplomatic corps.\n\nGrowing international tensions make matters worse domestically as well. The Empire is home to more than a dozen different national ethnicities, all with their own languages, traditions, and customs, and each of them vying for autonomy from the central government in Vienna, some more, some less vigorously. The activities of nationalist agitators are increasing the pressure on the stability and integrity of our Empire.\n\nThe Imperial-Royal Army, once the undisputed backbone of the Empire, still looks poised to crush any insurrection. But an exacerbating financial crisis means that its funding is in jeopardy, and the Imperial-Royal Navy is also vying for an increased share of the Empire's military budget.\n\nDespite the challenges at hand, rest assured that the House of Habsburg will rise above all its adversaries to proclaim hegemony over the continent once again - Austriae est imperare orbi universo!"
 austria.2.a: "Surely a challenge."
 austria.3.t: "External Threats to the Austrian Empire"
 austria.3.d: "Our Empire has stood against the sands of time and resisted strong adversaries and threats from abroad, from the likes of Frederick the Great to Napoléon Bonaparte, which have collectively gathered many enemies amongst our people. Only recently, we bargained with the Russians to come to our defense amidst the Hungarian Revolution, but afterwards we had to turn our back on them during the Crimean conflict. It is also obvious that Italy is still in turmoil, and those opposed to us are restless to throw off our yoke. The Piedmontese government is a prime example of this.\n\nMany external threats surround us and alliances are waiting to be made. It will be our task to make sure we come out on top..."
 austria.3.a: "We need to tread carefully..."
 austria.4.t: "Internal Threats to the Austrian Empire"
 austria.4.d: "The Austrian Empire encompasses more than a dozen different nationalities who are vying for more autonomy from the government in Vienna — a desire that was refused over and over by the central government. The nationalist agitation of certain individuals remains the most dangerous internal threat, but it is not the only issue. Some of our ministers and diplomats stare wearily off into the distance, expecting the worst to happen in upcoming conflicts. If our Empire is to pass into the modern age, then we will need to deal with these issues once and for all."
 austria.4.a: "We need to find solutions..."
 #HABSBURG EVENTS
 austria.11.t: "The Birth of an Heir to the Throne"
 austria.11.d: "After two daughters, the Austrian Empire finally has a male heir. Son of Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Elisabeth, the crown prince secures the Emperor's own line of the House of Habsburg. He was born in the imperial castle of Schloss Laxenburg, near Vienna, and will be named Rudolf, after one of his great ancestors. The throne of Austria is secure for another generation."
 austria.11.a: "He shall be named Rudolf, like his famous ancestor."
 austria.12.t: "The Death of Archduchess Sophie"
 austria.12.d: "Today marks the tragic loss of Emperor Franz Joseph first child, Archduchess Sophie of Austria, at the age of two. Named after the Emperor's mother, she was born on March 5th 1855. The Empress, being judged too young to raise her children, had seen her daughters being taken away quickly after the birth of her second child.\n\nHowever, during a planned trip to Hungary, the Emperor and his wife had managed to take them on their trip to Budapest, during which the two daughters fell ill with acute diarrhea, and a very high fever. While Gisela, the second daughter, survived, Sophie didn't survive, and dies in the arms of her mother."
 austria.12.a: "What a horrible loss..."
 austria.13.t: "The Emperor and the Empress visit Hungary"
 austria.13.d: "The Emperor of Austria, Franz Joseph Karl, and Empress Elisabeth of Austria, rode the train from Vienna to Preßburg, where they then rode the Kaiser Franz Joseph-Orientbahn rail line to Buda-Pesth. The trip was deemed a "spectacular sight" by the Empress, who is known to enjoy the great outdoors and dabbles in the adventerous side of life. Upon arriving in the great city, their first destination was to marvel at the construction of St. Stephens Basilica, which had only been started a few years prior. The Emperor, who is deeply devoted to Roman Catholicism, wished to visit there and was even given a brick to lay down towards its construction, a sight he vows he will never forget. Upon reaching the River Danube, they were privately ferried across to Buda Castle, where a tour was given to the royals and lunch was provided. A magnificent structure that had only recently been refurbished by two prominent architects, Josef Weiss and Carl Neuwirth. After their lunch and a ride back on the train, the Emperor and Empress concluded by saying the trip was a delight, and a return is to be expected soon."
 austria.13.a: "Let us hope the Hungarians treated them well."
 austria.14.t: "The Birth of Archduchess Marie Valerie"
 austria.14.d: "Princess Marie Valerie of Austria was born in Buda, in the Kingdom of Hungary. Fourth child of the Emperor and Empress, she will quickly become the favorite daughter of the latter. She's often referred by some courtiers as "Die Einzige", "the Only Child", due to how much the Empress was adored by her mother. This was mostly due to her being the first child she was allowed to raise entirely.\n\nShe was also nicknamed "The Hungarian Child" because her birth was a concession between the Empress Elizabeth who wanted better relations with her favorite part of the Empire, and the Emperor. She was born nine month after Franz Joseph's coronation in Budapest, as the new King of Hungary."
 austria.14.a: "The 'Hungarian' Child."
 austria.14.b: "The Only Child."
 #FLAVOUR EVENTS
 austria.21.t: "The Blue Danube Waltz"
 austria.21.d: "'An der schönen, blauen Donau', or 'The Blue Danube' as it is commonly referred to in English, is the new waltz of the great Austrian composer Johann Straus II. Composed in 1866, it has been for the first time been played at a Vienna Men's Choral Association concert today.\n\nIt has encountered only a mild success however, but Johann Strauss will continue to play his piece around the world, hoping to find better success in the international stage."
 austria.21.a: "O' Glorious Danube!"
 austria.22.t: "A German Requiem"
 austria.22.d: "'Ein deutsches Requiem, nach Worten der heiligen Schrift', or 'A German Requiem, to Words of the Holy Scriptures' is the new composition by Johannes Brahms. Inspired from the Lutherian Bible, and by the tragic death of his mother in 1865, it is the result of 3 years of work. With a runtime of around 80 minutes, it is Brahms's longest composition yet.\n\nThe critics have praised his craftsmanship, and the piece has been very well received in the musical world. However, some of them still has criticized the composition for its lack of Christian content, the piece being meant to be non-liturgical."
 austria.22.a: "Beautiful."
 austria.23.t: "The Opening of the Vienna Court Opera"
 austria.23.d: "In Vienna, a new opera house has finally finished its construction after 8 years. The Vienna Court Opera is based on plans drawn by August Sicard von Sicardsburg and Eduard van der Nüll, and was built under the supervision of the Czech architect Josef Hlávka.\n\nThe great building has been inaugurated in the presence of Emperor Franz Joseph, and of the Empress. The public hasn't been pleased with the building however. Mockingly seen as a "sunken treasure chest" due to the rise of the neighboring road, and has often been referred to using the various military disasters."
 austria.23.a: "A Fine Addition to Vienna."
 austria.24.t: "Trisch-Trasch-Polka"
 austria.24.d: "Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka is a polka composition by the famed Austrian composer Johann Strauss II. Written after a widely successful tour of Russia, it was first performed in a concert in Vienna. The name "Tritsch-Tratsch", or "chit-chat" in English, refers of the Viennese custom of gossiping. As such, it is a very light and happy composition, which is often the case in Strauss's music."
 austria.24.a: "How Wonderful."
 austria.25.t: "Giovanni Visin First Croat to Circumnavigate the Globe"
 austria.25.d: "Giovanni Visin today became the first Croat to ever circumnavigate the globe. Born in 1806 near Kotor, Visin comes from a line of Crotian men of the sea. He grew up in Istria, where he went to the Naval Academy at Trieste and soon after bought his own ship, the 'Splendido'. Aboard the brig, Visin started servicing trade routes in the Mediterranean for goods and people in 1850, and on February 11, 1852, he started his first intercontinental voyage. His ship was the first Austrian vessel to enter the harbors of Australia and Thailand. Today, after more than 100,000 nautical miles, and a stopover at Plymouth harbor because of the war in Italy, his ship reaches Trieste, only narrowly beaten by the SMS Novara. He will surely be remembered."
 austria.25.a: "What an achievement!"
 austria.26.t: "Radetzky Monument Unveiling in Prague"
 austria.26.d: "Today, a monument dedicated to field marshal Joseph Radetzky is going to be unveiled in Prague. The monument is situated at Malostranské náměstí, an important site in Prage, and the ceremony will be attended by our Kaiser Franz Joseph and his wife, Kaiserin Elisabeth of Bavaria. Radetzky, who unfortunately died earlier this year, was one of the greatest generals among our ranks. He was crucial in our victories not only over the revolutionaries, but also over the treacherous Sardinians in 1848/49, and famous composer Johann Strauss created the so-called "Radetzky Marsch" dedicated to Radetzky's victory in the Battle of Custoza in 1848. In fact, the march has become so popular among soldiers that it is now mostly used in a celebratory manner rather than a martial one. This monument now stands as a tribute to this great military leader and will commemorate him in our time."
 austria.26.a: "A great honor."
 austria.27.t: "Rieger's Dictionary of Learning Published"
 austria.27.d: "The first part of the 'Slovník naučný' (or, 'Reference Book') has been published in Prague today. Even though this marks only the first step in František Ladislav Rieger's endeavor to provide a complete Czech encyclopedia of general knowledge, the excitement around this publication was still great, since it's the first general encyclopaedia written in the Czech language and, thus, accessible to a greater public in Bohemia and Moravia. It is expected that Rieger and his publisher, Ignaz Leopold Kober, will publish a total number of at least twelve volumes of the encyclopedia, but it will definitely take a few years for them to finish this project."
 austria.27.a: "Let's hope this doesn't lead to problems."
 austria.28.t: "First Issue of Czech Newspaper Národní Published"
 austria.28.d: "After extended preparation and effort by František Ladislav Rieger since September of last year, the first issue of the new Czech newspaper 'Národní listy' ('The National Newspaper') was published with a circulation of 7,000 copies in Prague. Rieger functions as editor of the newspaper and is keen to promote his paper to be distributed to the other Czech-speaking regions of the realm. As this is fairly clearly a newspaper with Czech nationalist tendencies, and it is still uncertain whether it will impact the integrity and stability of the Habsburg rule in Bohemia and Moravia, it is best to stay cautious of their publications."
 austria.28.a: "We need to keep an eye out..."
 austria.29.t: "Town of Trutnov Destroyed by Fire"
 austria.29.d: "Shocking reports reach us from the town of Trutnov (Trautenau) near Hradec Králové (Königgrätz), indicating the town has been destroyed by fire almost completely. Apparently, about 90% of the buildings have been consumed by the flames, among them the remarkable Renaissance Era town hall, which has burned down to the ground and will have to be rebuilt. It's certainy a great disaster and casualties are still rising."
 austria.29.a: "What a disaster!"
 austria.30.t: "Sokol Gymnastic Club Founded in Prague"
 austria.30.d: "After the adoption of the new constitutional patent in the Austrian Empire, which allows for the foundation of clubs and societies, the Sokol Gymnastic Club has recently been established in Prague and will hold its first general meeting today. Jindřich Fügner is expected to be elected as the first mayor, with Miroslav Tyrš serving as his deputy. It is also expected for the sports club to attract many people and flourish since now people are allowed to join various artistic, theatrical, decorative, and physical education associations. The future is looking bright for the people of Prague."
 austria.30.a: "Hm, ok."
 austria.31.t: "Vienna Stadtpark Opens"
 austria.31.d: "Earlier today, the Stadtpark opened its doors in Vienna and now everyone from the capitol can enjoy a great stroll in the park. It was designed in the style of English gardens by landscape painter Josef Selleny and the plans were created by city gardener Rudolf Siebeck. The design harmonically complements both, the river that runs through the park and the Karolinenbrücke that hovers over the river. It is a beautiful addition to our capitol's charming scenery."
 austria.31.a: "Time for a stroll?"
 austria.32.t: "First Ascent of the Marmolada by Paul Grohmann"
 austria.32.d: "News reaches us that our famous mountaineer Paul Grohmann managed the first ascent of the highest mountain of the Dolomites, the Marmolada, together with his two guides, the brothers Angelo and Fulgentio Dimai. This is not the first time that Grohmann has managed a first ascent, and it is needless to say that he will try to achieve even more breakthroughs as a proud Austrian mountaineer."
 austria.32.a: "Congratulations."
 austria.33.t: "Gregor Mendel Presents his Laws of Heredity"
 austria.33.d: "Today, Gregor Mendel, a humble monk and part-time scientist from Moravia, has published his biological studies on the genetics of selected plants after many years of research. Mendel's discoveries have the potential to be groundbreaking, formulating the laws of heredity themselves. It ultimately seems to come down to three separate, yet not independent laws: dominance, segregation, and independent assortment. If Mendel's discoveries and, thus, the three laws of heredity prove to be true, it might be possible to cultivate plants and breed animals much more effectively and according to very specific needs if the right pairs to match can be found. Though it seems like Mendel's publication is being ignored by the scientific community so far, it still managed to generate a few favourable reports in local newspapers. Only time will tell if his findings are confirmed."
 austria.33.a: "What a great discovery!"
 austria.34.t: "Apparition of the Virgin Mary in Filipov"
 austria.34.d: "It's been quite a miraculous and eventful day in the small town of Filipov. Earlier today, at four o'clock in the morning, a miracle in the form of the apparition of the Virgin Mary is said to have happened in this small village in the Sudetes. The 19-year-old villager Magdalena Kade had been diagnosed with a fatal disease without any known cure by the doctors, after a grave ulceration on her chest had developed a few months prior. Magdalene was bedridden and frequently passed out. During yesterday's night, however, she prayed together with a friend who helped here get on, and Veronika fell asleep, shortly after which the miracle is said to have happened. According to the newspapers who report Magdalena's story on the front pages, a female figure emanating a very bright light appeared in front of her bed, wearing a yellow crown on her head. It is believed to be the Virgin Mary who appeared to moribund Magdalena, healing her in a miracle. The doctors have declared Magdalena healthy and have no earthly explanation."
 austria.34.a: "Truly blessed."
 austria.35.t: "Smetana's Opera 'The Bartered Bride' Premiers in Prague"
 austria.35.d: "Today, 'Prodaná nevěsta' (or 'The Bartered Bride'), a comic opera piece written by Bedřich Smetana, a Czech composer, will premier in the Provisional Theatre in Prague. The opera seems like an interesting work of art indeed: the plot is set in a country village and it tells the story of how, after a surprise revelation, true love prevails over the efforts of forceful parents and a tricky marriage broker. It is expected to become a success, although the author might still have to make adaptions and revisions until the next big performance, which would not be out of the ordinary."
 austria.35.a: "A wonderful piece of art."
 austria.36.t: "Czech Crowns Jewels Return to Prague"
 austria.36.d: "The Bohemian crown jewels have finally returned to Prague from Vienna, where they had been relocated to due to the Prussian threat during the German War. These crown jewels were forged in the 14th century, when Emperor Charles IV had them made for his coronation as King of Bohemia and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and consist of many items: the Crown of Saint Wenceslas (named after the saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia, of the Přemyslid dynasty), the royal orb and sceptre, the coronation vestments of the Kings of Bohemia, the gold reliquary cross, and the sword of Saint Wenceslas. Now that they have returned to Prague, they will once again be stored in the famous St. Vitus Cathedral."
 austria.36.a: "It's where they belong, I guess."
 austria.37.t: "Disastrous Windstorm Devastates Bohemia"
 austria.37.d: "A great disaster has struck Prague and the rest of Bohemia today. A gigantic night storm damaged many houses in the area and a few people were killed in the process. The Church of St. Stephen in Nové Město, Prague, was severely hit and the damages the storm caused are likely to be irreparable. The storm also reached the Boubín Forest and caused great damage there, leaving large parts of the area in total devastation with about two thirds of the tree fallen. It will be challenging to restore the affected lands to their former state, and is going to require great effort to avoid further calamities in the future."
 austria.37.a: "Oh, no!"

 ###RAILWAY EVENTS
 austria.51.t: "Railway Line from Vienna to Munich - Planning Complete"
 austria.51.d: "Plans have existed since the early 1850s to connect the Austrian capital Vienna to Munich via railway. After initial failure, the plan has recently been revitalized, much to the joy of our beloved Empress Elisabeth, who is a Bavarian native. The planning for the railway line has been completed now. It will run west from Vienna to Linz, from where it will continue in south-western direction to Salzburg and meet the line from Bavaria behind the border. The line is scheduled to go into service in approximately three years time.

The planning for this line has already been concluded, they want to know whether we will continue our support for the project. When everything goes according to plan, construction would take only a little over a year.\n\nThere are also other unfinished railway projects that require our financial support, like the connection to Košice (Kaschau) and the line from Cracow (Krakau) to Lviv (Lemberg).

 ###DIPLOMACY AND GEC EVENTS
 #CRIMEAN WAR AFTERMATH EVENTS
 austria.101.t: "Aftermath of the Crimean War"
 austria.101.d: "The conflict between Russia and the combined allied forces of Great Britain, France, and Sardinia-Piedmont resulted from an effort to prevent the successful Russian invasion of the Ottoman Empire. The Russians were humiliated and bereaved in the aftermath, with their navy crippled, civilians fearing further conflict, and the government in crisis. Looking back, our own involvement in the crisis was hapless overall. Without any significant gains, we alienated the Russians who had supported us during the March Revolution, despite our promises and moral obligation to return the favor. We will have to decide how to proceed from here."
 austria.101.a: "Let's hope our actions in the past won't come back to haunt us."
 austria.102.t: "Austria Offers Cooperation in the Mediterranean"
 austria.102.d: "The Austrian Empire has sent their ambassadors to the steps of our government in hopes of establishing an alliance of political cooperation in the Mediterranean Sea. The agreement could be beneficial to us, as it'll allow open trade and naval docking on their ports along their Adriatic coast. The letter reads in good nature, and hopes for us to agree to this. We shall..."
 austria.102.a: "Accept the offer."
 austria.102.b: "Reject the offer."
 austria.103.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts Our Cooperation in the Mediterranean"
 austria.103.d: "Wunderbar! Our efforts were not in vain, and we have successfully reached out to the [FROM.GetName] and forged treaties of cooperation in the Mediterranean Sea. Our diplomats have returned waving letters of good deeds establishing the basis of this cooperation. We will not stand alone and will cooperate for mutual gain in the future. A toast to our new partners!"
 austria.103.a: "Good."
 austria.104.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Rejects Our Cooperation in the Mediterranean"
 austria.104.d: "Bastards! Our efforts were in vain, and the diplomats from the [FROM.GetName] have rejected our request for cooperation in the Mediterranean Sea. We stand alone without peers to help our cause. We had reached out with only good intentions and they shun us away... We will certainly remember this insolence."
 austria.104.a: "Damn."
 austria.105.t: "Cooperation in the Mediterranean Successful"
 austria.105.d: "Our extension of diplomats to foreign nations have come back with an overall result: Success. Our cooperation with other powers over the Mediterranean will boost our prestige and better improve our situation. An alliance to toast to."
 austria.105.a: "Great news."
 austria.106.t: "Cooperation in the Mediterranean Unsuccessful"
 austria.106.d: "Our extension of diplomats to foreign nations have come back with an overall result: Failure. This has put a stain in our relations with those who have denied us cooperation in the Mediterranean. The plan was all in vain, time and money all slipped away as a waste to fund this cause. We will stand alone."
 austria.106.a: "What a shame."
 austria.107.t: "Are the Austrian Diplomatic Efforts Genuine?"
 austria.107.d: "These past few weeks have seen the Austrian Empire aggrandize their foreign political agenda in effort to increase their prestige and relations to the other European power as to not fall behind and stay in the dark on the ever-forming alliances that spread to the nations. Our government in Saint Petersburg is one of the many they try to concur with; boasting about improving our diplomatic relations, the close bond between our peoples, and atoning to their past mistakes and threatening conflicts. They have especially highlighted over the fault in their backstab during our hard-fought Crimean War against Britain and France. Our advisors stand puzzled, unsure of their intentions..."
 austria.107.a: "We can't trust them."
 austria.107.b: "We must forgive them."

 austria.108.d: "These past few weeks have seen the Austrian Empire aggrandize their foreign political agenda in effort to increase their prestige and relations to the other European power as to not fall behind and stay in the dark on the ever-forming alliances that spread to the nations. Our government in London is one of the many they try to concur with; boasting about improving our diplomatic relations, the close bond between our peoples, and atoning to their past mistakes and threatening conflicts. They have notably apologized for their refusal to help in the conflict against Russia and other previous measures they have taken against us. Our advisors stand puzzled, unsure of their intentions..."
 austria.108.a: "Let's remain cautious for now."
 austria.108.b: "They seem genuine."
 austria.109.t: "Diplomatic Effort Successful!"
 austria.109.d: "Wunderbar! Our foreign advisors and their teams have returned back to Vienna, voicing their great return from their expedition as one of the greatest diplomatic successes of the Austrian Empire to date! The central governments in London and Saint Petersburg have humbly accepted our plea for amendment and have sent their own delegations along back to Vienna to continue this prosperous moment between our great nations. Let us hope we can keep these relations tall, as upcoming conflicts could require a call for their ever-needed support against our enemies..."

 AUS_uproar_in_italy_military_industry_effect_tt: "They've hit our §Ymilitary industrial capacities§!!"
 austria.153.t: "The Italian Conundrum"
 austria.153.d: "The Italian Conundrum concerns the political and military ramifications of our domains in Italy. Unlike the struggle against the nationalist and unrestful Hungarians, Croats, Bohemians, and other peoples of our Empire, who cannot count on foreign support, the Italian situation is special in this regard. We only control parts of the Italian peninsula, and the existence of independent powers — most notably [PIE.GetName] — which has significantly increased its international standing since the Crimean War and whose leaders and government support the growing sentiment of Italian nationalism, poses an even more significant threat. The insurgencies in Milan and Venice during the Revolutions of 1848/49 are testament that we need to be very watchful in regard to the activities of Italian nationalists across the peninsula."
 austria.153.a: "It might be wise to tread carefully."
 austria.154.t: "Our Subjects in Italy Demand Liberalization Promises Kept"
 austria.154.d: "Due to the liberal ideals of Archduke Maximilian, who had been appointed as Viceroy of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia in February 1857 when Emperor Franz Joseph had decided the immediate replacement of the elderly soldier Joseph Radetzky von Radetz, who had been stirring discontent amongst the Italian population. Maximilian promised liberal reforms to better the situation for the Italian peoples under Austrian control, and now this has come front to us: The Italians demand their promise fulfilled."
 austria.154.a: "We should act according to our promises."
 
 ###NATIONALIST THREAT EVENTS
 #NATIONALIST AGITATION EVENTS
 austria.201.t: "The Challenges of a Multinational Empire"
 austria.201.d: "This empire consists of a multitude of different and conflicting ethnicities that bicker and fight, loosening our hold over them and destabilizing their homelands. The challenges we face against them are undoubtedly increasing as more and more rise up against us. Our lands may be ethnically divided, but they are still under the control of the massive Austrian Army, which crushes any attempt of armed rebellion. The other powers of Europe do not face the same internal threat that we do, but we will stand atop them once our troublemakers are dealt with..."
 austria.201.a: "We need to find a cure against this nationalist madness!"
 austria.202.t: "Aftermath of the Revolutions of 1848/49"
 austria.202.d: "The years of 1848 and 1849 will be remembered as most unsettling among conservative and autocratic circles. The Austrian realm was hit particularly hard by these revolutionary uprisings, with insurgency blazing across the entire Empire, even prompting full-fledged warfare not only against Magyar nationalists but also against Risorgimento activists in Italy. These years marked an eternal struggle for survival of the old order which, by the grace of the generals and our armed forces, was crushed and our righteous rule restored. These years seem long past, but the nationalist sentiment they brought is still unfolding. We have to be wary..."
 austria.202.a: "Revolutionary ideals are still brewing below the surface..."
 austria.203.t: "The Situation in Hungary"
 austria.203.d: "In March 1848, Hungarian revolutionaries rose up against the government in Vienna to secure a great deal of autonomy for the Hungarian realm, which also included the Kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia (which were united in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia in 1849). The Hungarian revolutionaries under Lajos Kossuth soon pushed for the so-called April Laws, introducing many reforms that replaced the old feudal estate-based parliamentary system, gave the Hungarian Diet control over the Hungarian segments of the Imperial-Royal Army, and also handed full control over taxes raised in the Hungarian realm to the local government. The new Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, however, revoked them in an unconstitutional act that made many Hungarians question the moderate Batthyány government, who supported collaboration with the Austrians for greater autonomy and recognition.\n\nAfter a series of events had escalated into violence and murder, the Emperor ordered the immediate dissolution of the Hungarian Diet, which practically constituted a declaration of war against Hungary. Following a series of victories in the spring of 1849, Kossuth eventually proclaimed full autonomy of Hungary from the Austrian Empire, which prompted Franz Joseph to seek the support of Czar Nicholas I of the Russian Empire. With the help of the Russian troops, the imperial forces were able to gain the upper hand in the following months. Between August and October 1849 all Hungarian forces capitulated, upon which the victorious Feldzeugmeister Julius von Haynau was appointed as imperial governor of Hungary. He subsequently went on to execute the thirteen leaders of the Hungarian army as well as the former Hungarian head of government, Lajos Batthyány. Lajos Kossuth, however, managed to flee into exile.\n\nHungary was administered like an occupied state in the following years, and many Hungarians reacted with different forms of passive resistance as a consequence. Only slowly are repressive measures being cut back. Many Hungarians continue to invoke the validity of the April Laws of 1848, that have never been legally revoked, and resist any attempt of the central government in Vienna to strengthen its grip over Hungary."
 austria.203.a: "We need to make sure the Hungarians abide by the law."
 austria.204.t: "The Situation in Croatia"
 austria.204.d: "After centuries of being in a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary since before Hungary fell under a personal union with Austria, one might expect the Croats have been properly subjugated. But such notions are false, as proven by the Illyrian Movement, a movement that started in the 1830s, was based on and championed Croat Nationalism in the face of increasing Germanization and Magyarization, and continues to inspire Croatian nationalist agitators today. Ljudevit Gaj, the leader of this movement, also reformed and standardized the Croat Language, further fueling the sense of a distinctively Croat identity.\n\nAlthough the symbol of the Illyrian Movement and any mention of the name were banned in 1843 by Austrian Chancellor Metternich, the struggle of the Croats appears to be just the beginning. Thankfully, they aren't outright advocating for independence like the Hungarians are. In fact, following the actions of the Hungarian nationalist revolutionaries during the Revolutions of 1848/49, they seem more hostile toward the Hungarians than they are toward the government in Vienna. But any attempt to separate them from the Kingdom of Hungary will be near-impossible without further bloodshed.\n\nBe it as it may, tensions are brewing in the Croatian lands, and we need to be wary of any activities that could further destabilize the situation."
 austria.204.a: "We need to make sure the Croatians come to their senses."
 austria.205.t: "HIDDEN EVENT: Nationalist Uproar in the Empire?"
 austria.206.t: "Nationalist Uproar in Hungary"
 austria.206.d: "Hungarian University Students have taken to the streets of the largest cities, demanding that Ferdinand I become King of the Hungarian Kingdom. While some ranking Hungarian politicians have remained silent, these protests have the support of the most vocal Hungarian leaders."
 austria.206.a: "We need to get things back under control."
 austria.207.t: "Nationalist Uproar in Our West Slavic Lands"
 austria.207.d: "Bohemian and Slovakian protestors have begun gathering in anti-monarchist movements against the Austrian Crown. While they do not reflect the popular sentiments, nor do they currently present much of a notable threat, they will still arise problems if this is not dealt with swiftly."
 austria.207.a: "We need to get things back under control."
 austria.208.t: "Nationalist Uproar in Our South Slavic Lands"
 austria.208.d: "The Southern lands of our Empire have always presented us a pestering situation, as no concrete negotiation is ever formed to stagger this unrest. The Croats and Dalmatians are repeatedly in a state of unrest between each other and the central government, forcing our hands many times to mediate the complicated relationship between the two. This time shall hopefully be no different."
 austria.208.a: "We need to get things back under control."
 austria.209.t: "Nationalist Uproar in Our Polish Lands"
 austria.209.d: "The Polish and Ruthenians of our Eastern lands have taken to the streets to emulate the 1846 Uprising. While they are divided on their overall goals, they nevertheless present a worrying situation for us, and should be squashed as quickly as possible before anything spirals out of our control."

 ###DOMESTIC POLITICS EVENTS
 #DOMESTIC POLICY EVENTS
 austria.301.t: "The Laxenburg Manifesto"
 austria.301.d: "Emperor Franz Joseph I has published the Laxenburg Manifesto, in which he details the peace agreements to be made in light of recent events and promises reforms to be made domestically. Among the reforms are promises to relinquish control to local communal authorities, alongside promises to submit to 'effective control' the expenditures (civil and military) of the government. Assurances were also made to religious groups within the Empire, namely non-Catholic groups; Israelites are to be regulated along modern lines taking into account local and provincial conditions. Although few may notice the lack of the word 'constitution' or anything in its likeness, many feel that this new manifesto marks the beginning of consitutionality in the Austrian Empire."
 austria.301.a: "We need to redeem our reputation at all cost."
 austria.302.t: "The Fall of Alexander von Bach"
 austria.302.d: "Baron Alexander von Bach was the Austrian Minister of the Interior since 1849, known in the Austrian Empire as the man behind the centralization of the administrative authority of the Empire during the early years of Franz Joseph's reign. He then shifted more and more towards reactionary and absolutist ideas, which drastically and profoundly shaped the Austrian Empire during the 1850s, an era often called 'Bach's absolutism', or, due to his cooperation with the Catholic Church, 'Klerikalabsolutismus'.\n\nHowever, blamed for the failure of the Autrian-Sardinian War, von Bach has recently fallen from grace. His reforms were seen as one of the main reasons for the defeat, as they weakened the industrial potential of Austria and alienated many potential allies in the German Confederation. After his resignation a new man to lead the way needs to be appointed, and some degree of reform is inevitable. Count Bernhard von Rechberg seems like an obvious choice. As Austrian representative to the Federal Convention at Frankfurt and president of that institution, he looks like the ideal candidate to redeem our reputation among the German states and to assert our influence across Europe. Count Agenor Gołuchowski would be a more reformist choice. Himself a native of Galicia and the crownland's governor, he would certainly somewhat calm the nationalist agitation that is rampant across the realm, as it would signal that we are not reliant on German aristocrats for the government."
 austria.302.a: "Appoint Bernhard von Rechberg as Staatsminister."

 austria.303.t: "The Reichsrat Gathers in Vienna"
 austria.303.d: "Following the humiliating defeat in the Italian War, Emperor Franz Joseph I has now been convinced that the current system of neo-absolutism is threatening the very existence of the Empire. As a result, the Reichsrat was summoned. The delegates have now gathered in Vienna to advise the Emperor on the composition of a new constitution. At first, members of the Reichsrat were almost exclusively selected from the nobility of the realm, but following the order to enlarge the Reichsrat by 38 members, the chamber has grown to include a number of primarily German-speaking liberal delegates from common background as well. With the consequences of the enlargement yet to be seen, many in the council can now be seen bickering and debating on the details of the new constitution. In order to stop the Empire from moving ever deeper into crisis, the Reichsrat delegates now have the crucial role of determining how best to advise the Emperor. Perhaps the newly appointed delegates will shed some new light on the whole subject?"
 austria.303.a: "Let's hope the delegates can help."
 austria.304.t: "The State Debt Commission Commences its Operations"
 austria.304.d: "The delegates seem to be fairly unequivocal in their desire to unveil the sorry state of our national debt. They have been filing motions to create a debt commission to determine the magnitude of the problem, and we were forced to comply. The commission has started its operations and will report on the debt situation shortly."

With a few more cuts here and there and with some incentivization for economic growth, we could finally surmount our debt issues and continue on a path of fiscal health and prosperity."
 austria.305.d_significant_debt: "The state debt commission that we were pressured to initiate has just reported its findings:\n\nOur debt situation is alarming. We need to significantly reduce our expenses whilst at the same time uncover new sources of revenue and income, or we might be forced into bankruptcy eventually."
 austria.305.d_insurmountable_debt: "The state debt commission that we were pressured to initiate has just reported its findings:\n\nOur debt situation seems completely out of hand. Without drastic cuts on our expenses we will be forced into bankruptcy sooner than later, a prospect that seems almost unavoidable at this point."
 austria.305.a: "So, there is hope?"

 austria.306.d: "With a crisis of existence looming over the Austrian Empire, Emperor Franz Joseph I demanded that a constitution be written within a week, settling on general principles on a train stop headed to the conference. The Reichsrat, consisting almost entirely of conservative aristocrats, has come forward with a finalized proposal for the constitutional diploma. With this diploma comes the prospect of federalizing the Habsburg Empire, a prospect that seemed almost impossible just a decade prior. With concessions to liberals kept at a minimum, it seems clear as day to many that the diploma is a win for the old conservative nobility. Despite this, many in the Reichsrat stand firmly against the diploma, imploring the Emperor to consider extending the deadline to allow further work on the draft. The Emperor, however, looks to have sided with the federalists, and the diploma will probably be enacted in its current form shortly."
 austria.306.a: "Time to enact it."
 austria.307.t: "Constitutional Diploma Enacted"
 austria.307.d: "The controversial constitutional diploma has been enacted. It functions as the new constitution of the Austrian Empire. The document is seen as the final act of the neo-absolutist era in the Austrian Empire, although the Emperor still holds a lot of power even under the new constitution. Critics of the diploma, of which there are many, deplore the new constitution. Both, the more centralist German liberals, as well as the non-German federalists, particularly those from Hungary, are unhappy with the reforms. Whereas the liberals disapprove the shift of power from the central government in Vienna to local authorities, the federalists feel that the constitution gives too much power to a few landed noblemen, which will in turn prevent real change. The Magyars in particular are very unhappy with their involvement in the authorities of the Austrian realm and continue to demand a separate governing body that administers the Hungarian crown lands. It does not appear that this diploma will last long..."

 austria.307.b: "Let's hope it pleases the populace."
 austria.308.t: "Resistance Against Constitutional Diploma in Hungary"
 austria.308.d: "Despite giving Hungary a special status in the Reichsrat as per the October Diploma, the source of the Hungarian unrest has been left unresolved. Hungarian leaders want greater autonomy and recognition, and the few reforms that have been passed have only made them more furious."
 austria.308.a: "You can never please everybody."
 austria.309.t: "Massive Resistance Against Constitutional Diploma in Hungary"
 austria.309.d: "After our defeat at the hands of the Sardinians, Emperor Franz Joseph was forced to witness growing cracks in the Empire. From bureaucratic issues and obvious problems in the army, to ethnic minorities demanding an ever-increasing level of autonomy, the realm was in dire need of reform.\n\nAfter consulting the Reichsrat, the Imperial Parliament, for guidance on potential reforms for the Empire, the mainly conservative body naturally suggested a return of aristocratic federalism, and the Emperor followed suit. He asked his Minister of Interior to write a new constitutional diploma to be enacted across the Empire.\n\nDespite this generous new constitution, our financial situation continues to tumble and nationalist agitation, particularly in Hungary, is worsening. The failures of our administration are becoming clearer and clearer, a weakness that has even started to attract the attention of the German Confederation, and Prussia in particular. The influential German-speaking liberals across the Empire are pushing for a revision of the constitution - and a return to a more centralized state. The constitutional diploma seems to be a failure. What should we do about it?"
 austria.309.a: "Perhaps it's time for a change?"

 austria.310.t: "Liberals Protest Composition of the Reichsrat"
 austria.310.d: "Liberals across the Empire are protesting the composition of the advised Reichstag in accordance with the new constitution. They believe that the percentage of aristocrats and clerics amongst the delegates bears little to no relation to the political and societal realities of the Empire. They demand fairer representation of commoners."
 austria.310.a: "These delegates are invested by the grace of god!"
 austria.311.t: "Liberals in Vienna Protest"
 austria.311.d: "Following our decision to keep the constitutional diploma unchanged and firmly in place, liberal advocates, particularly German-speaking ones, have gathered in Vienna and other cities of the Empire to air their grievances with the current situation. They regard the current constitution as too federalized but not liberal enough and demand change. How should the executive forces react to such disobedience?"
 austria.311.a: "Arrest them all!"
 austria.311.b: "Leave them be."
 austria.312.t: "Constitution Revision Announcement Calms the Public"
 austria.312.d: "The announcement that the constitution will be revised by the new government under prime minister, [AUS.GetLeader], has calmed some of the unrest that the initial constitutional diploma had caused. It remains to be seen how the situation will develop."
 austria.312.a: "At least they're reasonable."
 austria.313.t: "The Imperial Constitution of [GetYear]"
 austria.313.d: "Today, the Emperor is going to enact a revised constitution for the Empire that has taken some of the criticism directed at the original constitutional diploma into account. The new constitution includes a Reichsrat that actually has partial legislative power and consists of more than a number of hand-picked aristocrats. There is hope that the Empire can finally prosper in peace under this new law."
 austria.313.a: "Peace and order at last?"
 austria.314.t: "Landtag Elections Approaching"
 austria.314.d: "With the tensions now seemingly settled after the disastrous enactment of the original diploma, the Reichsrat have announced an electoral college to discuss and begin the first act of the new constitutional Patent. Although the patent was ratified and enacted in order to fix the mistakes of its predecessor, many in the Reichsrat are still sceptical and displeased with the amount of concessions made in pursuit of resolution. As a result, there is talk among the political elite of the Empire suggesting that some regional delegates may not even attend the college in protest. However disliked the new patent is, only time may tell how well this election goes."

There have also been protests and resistance from local authorities and powerfuls against compliance with the new constitution in many parts of the realm. It will be interesting to see how the situation develops. Let's hope they don't cause too much trouble."

 austria.316.t: "Hungarian Landtag Refuses to Dispatch Delegates and Supports Tax Refusal"
 austria.316.d: "The Hungarian Landtag has informed the central government in Vienna that it will not dispatch delegates to the Reichrat. The vast majority of the delegates there, especially those of non-German background, are protesting against the inclusion of the Hungarian realm in the Reichsrat. They demand a separate governing body for the Hungarian realm in line with the Hungarian constitution of 1848. To reinforce their argument, the local authorities are calling for a widespread tax refusal among the Hungarian nobility, intellectual elite, and wealthy commoners."
 austria.316.a: "Can the Magyars ever be pleased?"
 austria.317.t: "Croatian Landtag Refuses to Dispatch Delegates"
 austria.317.d: "The Croatian Landtag has informed the central government in Vienna that it will not dispatch delegates to the Reichrat. They Croatians are still unhappy about their constitutional position. Nominally a part of the Hungarian realm, the Croatian national movement has been gaining support since the 1840s and had temporarily shaken off Hungarian overlordship during the Revolutions of 1848/49. Since then, the Croatian crown land has been in a legal limbo, with no precise ruling in effect. Many powerful Croatian individuals refuse to obey the new constitution that aims to restore their subordination under Hungarian control, and the Croatian Landtag has followed suit."
 austria.317.a: "Those fools..."
 austria.318.t: "Bohemian Landtag Delegates Protests Against Dispatch"
 austria.318.d: "Many of the non-German delegates of the Bohemian Landtag are protesting against the central government in Vienna, calling for a refusal to dispatch Bohemian delegates to the Reichrat. Ever since the Revolutions of 1848/49, more and more seats of local authorities and regional councils have shifted away from candidates embracing a joint German-Bohemian cultural identity towards advocates of a national-conscious Czech or Slovak identity. The most outspoken of these national agitators are calling for extensive autonomy from Vienna, especially taking into consideration the thwarted efforts of Czech national aspirations even under liberal rule. Following communication with Hungarian and Croat officials who are likely to refuse dispatching their delegates to Vienna, the Bohemian delegates are in protest against the new constitution and the overruling authorities of the Reichsrat. There protest, however, is unlikely to be successful, as the German and pro-governmental delegates still constitute the majority of the Bohemian Landtag."
 austria.318.a: "At least we can count on the German majority..."
 austria.319.t: "Galician Landtag Dispatches Delegates with Reservations"
 austria.319.d: "To no one's surprise, the Galician Landtag too has followed suit in their protest against dispatching delegates to the Reichsrat in Vienna. Despite the seemingly pro-Habsburg committee appointed consisting of Polish and Ukranian peasantry, the Polish aristocracy has taken this chance to push their agenda of continued autonomy from Vienna. Although the delegates will be dispatched, the Galician authorities want to remind the central government in Vienna of their disapproval of the new constitution and their curtailed regional autonomy. This comes at a time of rising tensions in the Polish lands held by the Russian Empire, from where advocates of Polish national independence factions have spilled over into the Galician territories of the Austrian Empire, provoking further dissent among the Polish minority of the realm."
 austria.319.a: "Is anyone happy with the constitution?"
 austria.320.t: "Transylvanian Landtag Refuses to Dispatch Delegates"

 austria.321.t: "Istrian Landtag Refuses to Dispatch Delegates"
 austria.321.d: "The Istrian Landtag has informed the central government in Vienna that it will not dispatch delegates to the Reichrat. With its very existence already called into question from the beginning of the constitution, many Istrian officials have now chosen to refuse dispatching a delegation. Sympathies for both Italian irredentism and calls for Risorgimento have effectively blocked further integration of the Istrian region into Austria proper. As a result, many Istrian delegates protest the increased central authority that the Reichsrat would grant to Vienna."
 austria.321.a: "They will comply!"
 austria.322.t: "Protest from Parts of the South Tyrolean Delegates"
 austria.322.d: "Delegates representing South Tyrol, a region with a divided German-Italian population, have ushered protests in light of the recent call to dispatch delegates to the Reichsrat in Vienna. Despite not being officially recognized as a crown land separate from Tyrol proper according to the constitution, many Italian-speaking officials in the region have expressed sympathies for the Italian cause. They demand that their constituencies should be incorporated into the Venetian Landtag instead of the Tyrolean."
 austria.322.a: "They will comply!"

 austria.323.d: "The various regional councils, or at least those who comply with the new constitution, have dispatched their Reichsrat delegates to Vienna.

 austria.326.d: "Following a quarrel within the Hungarian Landtag, the delegates who supported Ferenc Deák have prevailed and sent an address of protest to Emperor Franz Joseph I, demanding that the Hungarian Landtag gather in the predominantly Hungarian Pesth, instead of the German-dominated Ofen (Buda) on the other side of the Danube. Their main concern, however, is the continued refusal to comply with the new constitution. The Hungarian delegates continue to invoke the unbroken validity of the Hungarian constitution of 1848."

 austria.329.t: "The Hungarian Question"
 austria.329.d: "The new Staatsminister [AUS.GetLeader] has identified the question of Hungarian autonomy to be the decisive factor in the Empire's continued stability and progress.

Since it was never successfully enforced everywhere, the magnitude of the repercussions of this decision vary across the realm. This marks, however, a new low point in Austria's constitutional history.

Following the defeat against Prussia, different plans were presented to thoroughly reform the Austrian Empire into a federalized state. However, Belcredi's plan was quickly dropped in favor of Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust's agenda to form a dual monarchy. The new foreign minister, who had been leading the Saxon government prior to the war, seems to have gained the Emperor's trust, and is likely to hold more power than Staatsminister Belcredi, and the latter has consequently asked for his resignation. Should we accept it and make von Beust the new Staatsminister?"

 #RELIGIOUS UNREST EVENTS
 austria.391.t: "Ramifications of the Concordat of 1855"
 austria.391.d: "Ever since the agreement to greatly expand the power and influence of the Austrian Bishops' Conference detailed in the Concordat of 1855, many in the German speaking parts of the Empire have started protesting the continued empowerment of the Catholic Church, further reinforcing recent movements of anti-clericalism. Many argue that the relinquishment of control of the educational sector to the Catholic Church across the Empire may have disastrous consequences. Despite this, so far the Emperor and his government have refused any calls for reform or repeal."
 austria.391.a: "This agreement is in line with the will of the Emperor, and we must defend it."
 austria.392.t: "Denominational Unrest in the Austrian Empire"
 austria.392.d: "There are sizable communities of non-Catholic Christian denominations present and active in parts of our Empire, some of them more prominent and outspoken than others. There is a long history of struggle against heretic tendencies and disbelievers in our realm, and we have to decide how to proceed in these matters eventually. Some smaller heretic groups still follow the teachings of Jan Hus in Bohemia and Moravia, and there are also Waldensian groups underground, who have gotten stronger since the revolutions. They pose a threat to the stability of our rule and the integrity of the Christian faith in our realm."
 austria.392.a: "Yet another thing to keep an eye on."
 austria.393.t: "The Protestantenpatent"
 austria.393.d: "In an attempt to quell protests by Protestant Christians within the Empire, Emperor Franz Joseph I has enacted the so-called Protestantenpatent, a 25-paragraph patent granting the freedom of faith and practice to Protestants within the Austrian Empire, with the exception of the Kingdom of Hungary which has different regulations for religious practice anyway. In essence, the patent grants relative legal equality to the Evangelical (Lutheran) and Reformed Churches of the Augsburg Confession with the Roman Catholic Church. The move comes after years of opposition from Protestants both from within and outside the Empire against the stipulations of the Concordat of 1855. The Christian minorites within the Empire had become all too wary of the increase in influence and control of the Roman Catholic Church within the state's administration. As a concession, the Emperor has thus decreed equality within the eyes of the law to the practices and beliefs of the Protestant churches in the Austrian realm, barring certain limitations and exceptions."

The crowd, mainly consisting of Catholic zealots, exclaimed demands for repealing and rescinding of the patent, calling it a cowardly move to appease a morally incongruous faith. Many in the crowd feel that the Emperor and his government have betrayed them, the loyal Catholic subjects of the Empire, in favor of heretics who may throw the religious harmony of Europe into chaos. Such responses and beliefs are to be expected in every form of social change, and this particular group is no exception, for better or worse."

Nicknamed the "sage of the nation", he led the moderate Hungarians during the 1848 Revolution, and since then had gained even more fame after he proposed to Franz Joseph a compromise between the two nations. He had an essential role in the current compromise, but he doesn't seem keen on getting the role of Prime Minister.\n\nHowever, Count Gyula Andrássy would also be a prefect fit. A passionate revolutionary during the 1848 Revolution, he's a fervant Hungarian nationalist, and one of the most vocal voices for its autonomy in the Austrian Empire.

The Secret Police has tracked down several 'Pro-Independence Committees' operating throughout Hungary and many more are believed to exist. These committees have been collecting funds from abroad to fund a planned revolt. In addition to that, the people too appear dissatisfied with our administration and a large part of the Magyars have refused to pay taxes. The general consensus is that an uprising appears to be planned in Hungary."

Several thousand of men throughout the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen have taken up arms and have declared the 'Hungarian Republic' under the leadership of Lajos Kossuth who is currently on exile in Turin, in the [PIE.GetName]. The Hungarian revolt has been dubbed 'the Second Hungarian Revolution' and should we not crush the revolt as quickly as possible, it is very much possible that the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen will be lost from the Habsburg domains, and that the Magyars will inspire other nationalities within our empire such as Slavs or Romanians to revolt as well."

With the war now over, we can finally see what we should do with the three states. Conservatives propose we keep the status quo, which would make them susceptible to nationalist infiltrations.

Some influential members of the Lombardo-Venetian administration think they'd be best integrated into Lombardy-Venetia, to ensure our possessions in Northern Italy are under one firm rule, but others believe that we should form a separate kingdom there to ensure no faction is becoming too powerful.

 austria.532.t: "The Future of the [LVN.GetName]"
 austria.532.d: "The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia has been ours since the Congress of Vienna in 1815, following Napoleon's defeat. The Kingdom has however been a site of often violent insurrections by Italian nationalists again the Habsburg rule and with our close victory against Piedmont the time has come to decide on how we should deal with the Kingdom. A prominent idea put forward by the Conservatives is to annex Venice into the Austrian Empire, effectively recreating the Duchy of Lombardy. A popular option amongst the more Moderates is to keep the same structure for the Kingdom while the Liberals propose to give it more autonomy, in order to satisfy the Italians."
 austria.532.a: "Annex Venetia."
 austria.532.b: "Enforce the Status Quo."
 austria.532.c: "Loosen the grip on the Kingdom."
 austria.533.t: "Cede Savoy and Nice to France?"
 austria.533.d: "The territories of Savoy and Nice located on the border between Italy and France have always been a contentious issue. For centuries both Italian, they were annexed by the French Republic in 1792 due to their high French-speaking population, before being returned to Sardinia-Piedmont in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Now that northern Italy is firmly under our rule, we can opt to cede them to France. Doing so will increase our relations with them, which might entice France to help us in possible future struggles, but it will alienate Britain, and will anger Italian nationalists even further."
 austria.533.a: "We need all the friends we can get."
 austria.533.b: "It is too risky, we will keep them."
 austria.533.c: "Let Piedmont keep them."
 austria.534.t: "Austria Cedes Savoy and Nice"
 austria.534.d: "On [GetDateText] our troops entered Savoy and Nice for the first time since 1815, when it was ceded to the Piedmontese. The population cheered the French troops and thousands attended the official ceremony of the handing of Chambery from Austria to France. The agreement known as the 'Franco-Austrian Agreement on Savoy of [GetYear]' was signed between Staatsminister [AUS.GetLeader] of Austria and [FRA.GetLeader] of France. With this glorious agreement, the Austrians have not only proven that they can be trusted, but in fact that they can be good friends of ours. The Emperor later declared that 'the old grudge between France and Austria has been ended, now we can only expect friendship', effectively instructing his government to consider Austria a friend, not an enemy."

 #DOMESTIC POLICY AFTER VICTORY IN ITALY
 austria.541.t: "The Secret State Debt Commission Commences its Operations"
 austria.541.d: "A small number of hand-picked experts and confidants have gathered in Vienna to determine the magnitude of our debt situation. They were invited under false pretences to veil the true nature of their mission. His Majesty, the Emperor, himself will be greeting them shortly, after which the commission will be instructed in their task. We expect them to present their report in a few weeks."
 austria.541.a: "Make sure no one hears about this."
 austria.542.t: "The State Debt Commission Reports on the Debt Situation"
 austria.542.d_reasonable_debt: "The secret state debt commission that we initiated has just reported its findings:\n\nOur debt situation is still manageable. With a few more cuts here and there and with some incentivization for economic growth, we could finally surmount our debt issues and continue on a path of fiscal health and prosperity."
 austria.542.d_significant_debt: "The secret state debt commission that we initiated has just reported its findings:\n\nOur debt situation is alarming. We need to significantly reduce our expenses whilst at the same time uncover new sources of revenue and income, or we might be forced into bankruptcy eventually."
 austria.542.d_insurmountable_debt: "The secret state debt commission that we initiated has just reported its findings:\n\nOur debt situation seems completely out of hand. Without drastic cuts on our expenses we will be forced into bankruptcy sooner than later, a prospect that seems almost unavoidable at this point."
 austria.542.a: "So, there is hope?"

 austria.542.c: "Declaring bankruptcy might be the only way out..."
 austria.543.t: "Rumors about a Secret Meeting in Vienna Circulate"
 austria.543.d: "Apparently, a freelancer journalist has somehow gotten a scent of our secret dealings with the debt commission. Fortunately, our censorship agents have picked up his article before it was published and only a handful or two of his closest associates know about it. It was enough to spread the rumor that we try to hide a fiscal crisis from the public, though. We don't know how any of this could happen, but we need to do everything in our power to stop these rumors from spreading further."
 austria.543.a: "Damn."
 austria.544.t: "Anonymous Article about Looming Debt Crisis Published"
 austria.544.d: "The recent gathering of experts and confidants in Vienna to tackle our debt situation has inspired an anonymous article in a newspaper, that must have somehow slipped through censorship. The nameless author claims that the government is trying to hide a looming debt crisis from the public and that it uses the recent victory in Italy to distract from the true extent of the fiscal crisis."
 austria.544.a: "This nonsense needs to be stopped!"

 austria.545.d: "Our government officials have worked day and night to finalize the preparatory groundwork for the implementation of the planned centralization measures.

 #FEDERALIZATION OF THE EMPIRE
 austria.576.t: "Negotiations Begin with the Nationalities of the Empire"
 austria.576.d: "The Austrian Empire is now heading towards forming a great Central European federation of semi-autonomous states. Historically, the Empire had always been separated into two main areas, administered by Austria (Cisleithania) and by Hungary (Transleithania).\n\nWith our new federation being drafted, we might want to give the smaller nationalities some autonomy as well. It could weaken our two nations, but in the process we will be able to create a more stable federation."
 austria.576.a: "Negotiate only with the Magyars"
 austria.576.b: "Negotiate with all the Nationalities"
 austria.577.t: "The Vienna Conference"
 austria.577.d: "Kaiser Franz Joseph has called representatives from all of the Empire to discuss the framework of the Austrian Federation in Vienna. The Vienna Conference, as it is called, will decide on the fate of the multiple minorities in the Empire. The Federation will finally resolve the issues of autonomy, and national struggles.\n\nThe Kaier has high hopes for the conference's ability to resolve the problems of the crumbling Empire. Only God knows what the future of the Empire holds, but the Kaiser will listen to each group, listening to their demands and deciding on what's the most fair for the greater good of the Empire. Hopefully, that will be enough to restore peace."
 austria.577.a: "Let's hope all goes well"
 austria.578.t: "The Vienna Conference Ends"
 austria.578.d: "After many months of negotiations, the Vienna Conference finally ended. The Kaiser ha listened, and has taken his decision on every matter of interest.\n\nThe new federation will not be enacted, and the territorial changes will be made official. Autonomy for some, status-quo for others. Not everyone can be pleased in politics, but the Kaiser is confident that these new borders and administrations will at least buy him a few decades of peace.\n\nFor the better, or for the worst, Long Live the Federation and the Kaiser!"

 austria.579.t: "Negotiate with the Magyars"
 austria.579.d: "The biggest minority in the Austrian Empire, the Magyar has always been keen on gaining autonomy in the Kingdom. The 1848 has shown that the idea won't be abandoned until they have what they want, which is the reason for this negotiations.\n\nWe now have to decided whether or not the Austrian Crown accepts or rejects the Hungarian one. However, it seems obvious that refuing it will only lead to trouble."
 austria.579.a: "Accept the Hungarian Crown"
 austria.579.b: "Reject the Hungarian Crown"
 austria.580.t: "Negotiate with the Slovaks"
 austria.580.d: "The Slovaks are one of the many minorities in the Carpathians. Located in Northern Transleithania, right in the historically Hungarian lands, the Slovaks has asked for autonomy like many others in the Empire. Now, with the Federation being drafted, we can officially state our position on a Slovakian autonomous region.\n\nWe could accept total autonomy of the Slovaks, but giving it to Hungary might also strengthen it."
 austria.580.a: "Enact Slovak Autonomy"
 austria.580.b: "Keep Slovakia under Hungary"
 austria.581.t: "Negotiate with the Transylvanians"
 austria.581.d: "Transylvania is a province right in the middle of Hungarian Transleithania. While Transylvanians had relative autonomy, under a principality separate from the Hungarian crown, it still was formally administrated by the Hungarians.\n\nTransylvania could be a great candidate for full autonomy, which could stabilize the area, but also weaken Hungary. We could also keep the most Hungarian area of Szekerland in Hungaria, while giving the rest full autonomy."

 austria.582.d: "Crotia had always been a source of tensions in the Austrian Empire. While Hungary claims most of it, the Croats, like many others, wanted more autonomy, and the ability to decide their fate themselves. Dalmatia has some of the most important ports of the Austrian Empire, so while Croatian autonomy will stabilize the Empire, it might also make Austrian presence in the Mediterranean weaker.\n\nWe could give Croatia only the non-Dalmatian part of the territory they claims, but we also could let it stay inside of Hungary."

 austria.584.d: "Bohemia is part of the Austrian administred area, Cisleithania. The Bohemians militated for the return of the Kingdom of Bohemia. The Czech politicians, often liberal, are now open to negotiate their autonomy with Austria.\n\nThe historical territory of the Kingdom of Bohemia claimed by the Czech contains a German-majority area, Sudentenland. We could allow Bohemian autonomy under the condition that Austria would keep it, but Austria could also keep the whole territory, as they could use the economic support coming from the wealthy lands of Bohemia."
 austria.584.a: "Full Autonomy for Bohemia"

 austria.584.c: "All of Bohemia will stay under Austria"
 austria.585.t: "Negotiate with the Galicians"
 austria.585.d: "The vast territory of Galicia-Lodomeria lies at the easternmost part of the Austrian-administred Cisleithania territory. Galician culture has always been at odds with the Vienna leadership. Closer to Poland than it is to Austria, they have called for autonomy for centuries. Now that the federation is being formed, they want to take their chance."

While they are a very small region, which wouldn't cause much trouble, we might look into making them truly autonomous.

Archduke Charles, who headed the reform process, deemed it appropriate to educate the senior officers in important advances of the military sciences in the form a periodical journal.

It seems in their attempts to engineer a suitable design, funds were used up at an alarmingly high rate, without groundbreaking success to show for. Prototype after prototype kept failing and needing re-manufacturing, until finally the coffers ran dry. With no funds left to continue additional design and tooling changes, the committee has been forced to inform us of their failure. We could try to entrust other engineers with a similar task as this, but then again, we can ill-afford these lavish fundings of seemingly inconsequential projects and ideas as things stand."

His crushing defeat in the Battle of Magenta against the Italians and their allies puts us in a bad spot. It would be wise to recall him back to Wien, and instead let the Emperor decide how to handle the situation to avoid demoralizing the army entirely. Should Ferenc Gyulay remain as Feldmarschall, or should he be recalled from his command? Keeping him there will surely anger both the people and the army."

 austria.801.d: "The Kaiserlich-königliche Kriegsmarine, or Imperial-Royal Navy, was mostly made up of Italian crew members up until the appointment of Ferdinand Maximilian; the Italian language was the primary language, and even Italian ship names were used over German ones. While the rest of Europe upheaved their naval production during the Age of Exploration and furthered it during the Napoleonic Age, Austria sat back and promoted a 'Fleet in Being' doctrine, partially due to its advantageous seafaring and rivaling neighbors to the south. But now, with a change in leadership and the threat of a unified Italian rival, Emperor Franz Joseph has made the final decision: Austria will need a great and prodigious Navy, one to rival its enemies and protect Austrian interests: A truely Imperial Navy."

 #DEBT CRISIS EVENTS
 austria.901.t: "The Empire's Financial Crisis"
 austria.901.d: "The Austrian Empire and its domains have never seen the luxurious goods of a quantifiable economic boom that has seemed to reach so many other nations. With so many conflicts in the last century adding up, our debt has been climbing to threatening heights, and paying off the interest on it all has been taking up a large portion of the annual national funds.\nThe massive Imperial-Royal Army that protects our lands requires immense funding to sustain its quality. The officers' and generals' pensions are paid generously while they are enjoying other benefits that many other armies do not provide. Since the revolutions of 1848 and 1849, Italy's garrison has nearly doubled, and the cost has not been insignificant.\nThe formation of the Zollverein under the aegis of Prussia dealt a blow to our economic influence in most of Germany, and despite our best and most sincere efforts we are still not included in this customs union. This leads to issues for our economy, too, as difficulties in opening businesses and trading continue to dwindle the morale and incentive of our subjects to further the Industrial Revolution in our realm.\nWhile it does seem that we will remain behind other Great Powers, our industries have shown some promising sparks of life lately, after some shrewd reforms by Staatsminister Bach and his ministers and advisors. The likes of Anselm Salomon von Rothschild, Karl Adalbert Lanna, Johann Adolf zu Schwarzenberg, and other prominent economists are assembling industrial enthusiasts across the Empire."

Having been founded in 1840, the university has undergone many revisions and structural changes, and a proposed increase towards the school has been talked about. This is one of Austria’s finest schools, it’s best we keep it to standard."
 austria.933.a: "Good news."
 austria.934.t: "Hungarian Gold"
 austria.934.d: "During the Middle Ages, Hungary produced the lion's share of European gold currencies. The Hungarian mines were widely known for their excellent minerals and made the region prosperous. During the period of Spanish imperialism in the New World, however, the status and importance of the Hungarian mines quickly faltered, as the European mainland was swept with precious metals from Latin America. Even though competition was high, the Hungarian gold mines have continued to produce the highest amount of precious metals in all of Europe to this point, and we can surely still profit from it."

However, because time is running out and our government is split, an agreement was made with Russia, and they are now defending our territory to protect us from the ongoing Hungarian Revolution while we sort out our internal matters. More than a dozen distinct nationalist nationalities have fought for autonomy against the government in Vienna, which has been a source of contention for decades. These issues are putting further strain on our empire's stability, but any efforts at insurgency will be crushed quickly because their territory is still under Austrian control. Despite the obstacles, we are making progress and will rise above these issues."

We just negotiated with the Russians to come to our aid during the Hungarian Revolution, but we were forced to abandon them during the Crimean crisis. It's also clear that Italy is still in shambles, and those who oppose us are itching to shake off our burden. The government of Piedmont is a good illustration of this. Many foreign threats loom over us, and alliances are forming. It will be our responsibility to ensure that we win..."
 AUS_focus_aftermath_of_the_crimean_war: "Aftermath of the Crimean War"
 AUS_focus_aftermath_of_the_crimean_war_desc: "The struggle between Russia and the united allied troops of Great Britain, France, and Sardinia-Piedmont sprang from a desire to prevent the Ottoman Empire from being successfully invaded by Russia. In the aftermath, the Russians were humiliated and heartbroken, their fleet weakened, citizens fearful of further conflict, and the government in disarray. In retrospect, our role in the crisis was mostly unsuccessful. Despite our pledges and moral need to repay the favor, we alienated the Russians who had backed us during the March Revolution. From here, we'll have to figure out what to do."

 AUS_focus_the_italian_conundrum_desc: "The Italian Conundrum is about the political and military consequences of our Italian territories. Unlike the nationalist and unrestful Hungarians, Croats, Bohemians, and other peoples of our Empire who cannot rely on outside help, the Italian position is unique. We only have control over a portion of the Italian peninsula, and the existence of independent powers — most notably [PIE.GetName], which has significantly increased its international standing since the Crimean War and whose leaders and government support growing Italian nationalism — poses an even greater threat. The insurgencies in Milan and Venice during the 1848/49 Revolutions demonstrate the importance of keeping a close eye on the actions of Italian nationalists across the peninsula."

The most severe internal threat is the nationalist agitation of a few individuals, but it is hardly the only one.

As more and more people rise up against us, the issues we confront are surely mounting. Even if our territories are ethnically split, they remain under the rule of the enormous Austrian Army, which suppresses any effort at armed insurrection.

These revolutionary movements hit the Austrian realm particularly hard, with insurgency spreading across the Empire and even triggering full-fledged battle not just against Magyar nationalists but also against Risorgimento radicals in Italy. These years signified an endless fight for the old order's survival, which was finally smashed by the generals and our military forces, and our just authority was restored.

The Catholic Church is fully responsible for all marriage affairs involving at least one Catholic spouse under this rule, which favors the Catholic religion above other Christian groups. Marriages involving Catholics will be handled by the Catholic Church rather than the state.

Our kingdom has a long history of fighting heretic inclinations and disbelievers, and we will have to determine how to continue in these things at some point. In Bohemia and Moravia, several tiny heretic organizations still follow Jan Hus' beliefs, and there are also Waldensian underground groups that have become stronger since the revolutions.

Its existence allows us to have our army to be run with officers of a scientific approach that can truly understand the modern world of warfare, rather than remaining trapped in previous conceptions of warfare.

However, its technology has also constantly improved, and our own rifles must keep pace with these changes. We have multiple options, but our primary choice is whether we will create a new rifle or modernize the Lorenz further. Both have their own drawbacks and advantages, and a decision must be made regarding the future of our rifles."

 AUS_focus_conduct_cannon_experiments: "Conduct Cannon Experiments"
 AUS_focus_conduct_cannon_experiments_desc: "To truly know the worth of recent advancements in cannon technology, we must make use of trials and experiments. While rifle trials can be conducted with relative ease, cannon trials are far more involved and require more study. However, they yield great results and can tell us the worth of our current training, loading methods, and shell types all at once."

 AUS_focus_muzzle_loading_cannons_desc: "Despite advances in modern cannonry, our muzzle-loaders still serve us well in terms of return on investment, and our generals have suggested that they still perform well when brought up against breech-loading cannons. Instead of starting from scratch, we will design improved muzzle-loading cannons based on our experience with rifled muzzle-loaders."

 AUS_focus_a_conservative_stance_desc: "Our Army has served our nation through many of its most difficult periods, and despite the best efforts of even the greatest generals of the ages, we have stood the test of time. Our great morale and unique military, loyal to our Emperor before any nation protects it from both external and internal threats, and disrupting this system could destroy us. Our soldiers fight harder than their enemies, is that not enough?"
 AUS_focus_the_old_guard_knows_best: "The Old Guard Knows Best"
 AUS_focus_the_old_guard_knows_best_desc: "Many of the younger officers of the army wish to implement ideas derived from the Prussians military. The so-called “Science of War” hopes to understand warfare in the same way as disease, drastically misunderstanding war. Their beliefs seem to forget how we cowed the Prussians and their military in 1848 and our long and illustrious history with the present methods of command. These ideas will not improve our military but will instead divide and weaken it."

 AUS_focus_rely_on_senior_officers: "Rely on Senior Officers"
 AUS_focus_rely_on_senior_officers_desc: "Our senior officers represent the accumulation of all Austrian military knowledge, and we should rely on them rather than younger potentially radical officers. The fact that they are mostly conservative and aristocratic is simply a wonderful coincidence. If we can encourage them to stay in active service for longer, we will also save money on pensions and pay for new officers."

 AUS_focus_learn_from_the_past_desc: "Despite the many glories our armies have enjoyed, our history is not without its defeats. This can only be expected from a belligerent nation such as ours, but there are valuable lessons in even these defeats. Mistakes regarding troop movements and the unreliability of many of our maps have caused issues several times. Alongside this, the divided nature of much of our military, caused by its ethnic makeup, have often caused issues. Improving these flaws may finally allow our army to reach its greatest state."
 AUS_focus_cavalry_reorganization: "Cavalry Reorganization"
 AUS_focus_cavalry_reorganization_desc: "The heavy cavalry is exorbitantly expensive, and was of little use during our last military operations. Our tactics remain focused on the cavalry charge, but this tactic has become less practical and more dangerous lately with the development of new weapon types. In light of this we must reorganize our cavalry to both cut down costs and improve their effectiveness in battle."
 AUS_focus_improve_army_cartography: "Improve Army Cartography"
 AUS_focus_improve_army_cartography_desc: "While many modern advancements are of dubious worth, improvements in cartography are unambiguously immensely useful. Adopting many of the more advanced methods of cartography developed in recent years will allow our army to operate with greater knowledge of the area than our enemy, particularly within our own lands. Our armies will find themselves able to maneuver better with this enhanced knowledge, and make both advances and retreat with far more ease."

While the rest of Europe upheaved their naval production during the Age of Exploration and furthered it during the Napoleonic Age, Austria sat back and promoted a Fleet-in-Being doctrine, partially due to its advantageous seafaring and rivaling neighbors to the south. But now, with a change in leadership and the threat of a unified Italy, Emperor Franz Joseph has made a final decision: Austria will need a great and prodigious navy, one to rival its enemies and protect Austrian interests - a truly Imperial-Royal Navy."

 AUS_decision_category_multinational_empire_desc: "People from many different nationalities are subjects in our glorious Empire and for long they have lived together peacefully. The Imperial Crown of the House of Habsburg, placed on the head of our monarch by the grace of God alone, has been a unifying and stabilizing institution for centuries, and Emperor Franz Joseph is a particularly well-liked figure on the imperial throne. The Spring of Nations in the first half of the 19th century has brought trouble, though. Blazing surges of nationalist agitation, up to the point of military rebellion, have swept various parts of the Empire and continue to threaten the peace and stability of our realm. We need to deal with these dangers before they get out of hand. But every one of our actions has the potential to spell disaster.\n\nCurrent Risk for Uproar in our:\n[HUN.GetFlag]§YHungarian Lands§!: [?HUN_REVOLT_RISK|-%1]\n[CZE.GetFlag]§YWest Slavic Lands§!: [?CZE_REVOLT_RISK|-%1]\n[CRO.GetFlag]§YSouth Slavic Lands§!: [?CRO_REVOLT_RISK|-%1]\n[POL.GetFlag]§YPolish Lands§!: [?POL_REVOLT_RISK|-%1]"

 AUS_decision_nationalist_agitation_countdown_desc: "Nationalist agitators of different ethnic and cultural groups are gathering across our realm. We must do everything in our power to stop them from causing trouble and to restore order in the Empire. If we have learned one thing from the revolution of 1848/49, it is that these issues need to be dealt with promptly and decisively, otherwise the situation could spiral out of control very quickly."
 AUS_decision_nationalist_agitation_countdown_trigger_tt: "The danger of §YNationalist Agitation§! has been averted."
 AUS_decision_nationalist_agitation_countdown_effect_tt: "§RDepending on the likelihood of nationalist uproar in our realm there might be trouble.§!"
 AUS_decision_promote_the_german_language: "Promote the German Language"
 AUS_decision_promote_the_german_language_desc: "We should enact a policy to promote the German language across the Empire. If every one of our subjects were able to speak German, we could open the pathway to creating a unique identity for our realm that does not focus solely on ethnic affiliation as a unifying factor."

 AUS_decision_stop_promoting_the_german_language: "Stop Promoting the German Language"
 AUS_decision_stop_promoting_the_german_language_desc: "Our language promotion policy has proven to be ineffective and to cause more damage than it does good. We must admit its failure and stop it immediately."
 AUS_decision_adapt_the_curriculum: "Adapt the Curriculum"
 AUS_decision_adapt_the_curriculum_desc: "The concordat with the papacy allows the Catholic Church to organize most of the primary education in our realm, but there are different rules in different parts of the Empire. We could exert our influence on the institutions dealing with education to make sure that the German language is a fundamental prerequisite for success everywhere, and to promote the idea of a more united Habsburg imperial identity over the importance of ethnic affiliation."
 AUS_decision_enforce_german_as_administrative_language: "Enforce German as Administrative Language"
 AUS_decision_enforce_german_as_administrative_language_desc: "If we were to make German the official language of all administrative institutions and proceedings, this would force many of our subjects to learn it. Our bureaucracy and bureaucrats need to be Germanized in order to fully encourage their collaboration with our plan to further unify the Empire."
 AUS_decision_restore_order: "Restore Order in the Empire"
 AUS_decision_restore_order_desc: "The revolutionary spirit lives on in many parts of our Empire. Many people still believe in the ideals of the March Revolution and are unwilling to accept that the realities have changed. Emperor Franz Joseph rescinded the March Constitution on the 31st of December 1851 once and for all, but resistance against His Majesty's decree still persists to this day. We need to do everything in our power to restore peace, order, and quiet in our realm."

 AUS_decision_grant_insurgents_amnesty: "Grant Amnesty to the Insurgents of 1848/49"
 AUS_decision_grant_insurgents_amnesty_desc: "The birth of the heir to the throne, Crown Prince Rudolf, would be regarded as a suitable occasion for the Emperor to demonstrate the Christian spirit of forgiveness. There are still many insurgents of the revolutions of 1848/49 waiting to be amnestied to be able to return to their families. Granting them their freedom would also calm unrest among their peers."
 AUS_decision_suppress_hungarian_nationalism: "Suppress Hungarian Nationalism"
 AUS_decision_suppress_hungarian_nationalism_desc: "The Magyars have remained extremely disobedient since their crushing defeat in the revolution of 1848 and have systematically refused to participate in civil governance and to pay taxes. They are surely very bad subjects of His Majesty and it is very urgent that any revolutionary ideas that they carry should be stopped."

 AUS_decision_suppress_west_slavic_nationalism_desc: "The peoples of the West Slavic lands of Bohemia-Moravia and Slovakia have allied themselves with the German liberals before and are a constant thorn in our side and aim to prevent the policies of Baron von Bach and his colleagues. We need to deal with them."
 AUS_decision_suppress_south_slavic_nationalism: "Suppress South Slavic Nationalism"
 AUS_decision_suppress_south_slavic_nationalism_desc: "Divided between the imperial crownlands of Austria and the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen, but united under the rulership of Emperor Franz Joseph, the South Slavic Peoples along the Dalmatian coast have a mercurial history in terms of their relationship to the Empire as a whole. We need to be aware of unpredictable trouble."
 AUS_decision_suppress_polish_nationalism: "Suppress Polish Nationalism"
 AUS_decision_suppress_polish_nationalism_desc: "Carved up piece by piece by its powerful neighbors during the latter half of the 18th century, a Polish state had been re-instituted in 1807 under the aegis of Napoleon, but was quickly dissolved after his defeat. The Congress of Vienna constituted a Polish rump state in a personal union with Russia, the rest of it was divided between us and the Prussians. Our Galician holdings are home to a number of Poles who, although loyal so far, might remember the days of Polish greatness, so we must be aware of their activities."

 #Domestic Politics
 AUS_decision_category_domestic_politics: "Domestic Politics"
 AUS_decision_category_domestic_politics_desc: "Our realm is wider and much more diverse than many other states in Europe, with the exception of the Russian Empire. This fact presents our governance with a number of very demanding challenges. The rise of nationalism is a considerable threat to the inner cohesion of the various peoples we are proud to call our subjects, and agitators are calling for insurgency in many parts of the Empire. Non-Catholic Christians are also demanding more recognition and liberty than they currently enjoy, some have even joined forces with the various nationalist movements to change their situation by force. We need to be very alert of these activities. Eventually, we should overcome our defensive position and try to act on our own accord to shape the future of the realm in our image. But, as usual, domestic policy is closely tied to what is happening on the outside, too..."

However, the revolutions of 1848/49 and the subsequent reactionary policy hindered industrial growth. This in combination with the astronimical cost of our standing army, corrupted by nepotism, overexpendtiture, and general ineffectiveness, led to a huge budget deficit that over time has turned into a full-blown financial crisis that still haunts the country, which in turn further stifles investment and industrial development. We have to deal with this situation, and hope is not yet lost. Reforms and acts have been passed to deal with the growing debt and revitalize our economy. All we need is time and determination."

The drastic changes this development brought along seemed to generally and irreversibly transform the spirit of the country at a rapid pace, but the reigning elites were unwilling to share their wealth, status, and - consequently - power, which in part led to the March Revolution of 1848 and the subsequent restauration policy of the victorious aristocratic elite. The result was a financial crisis that continues to stifle investment and industrial development. But with the right set of actions, and support for successful and innovative entrepreneurs, we could awake a sleeping giant and revitalize industrial growth."

Tsar Nicholas I answered, and sent a 200,000 men strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian insurgents in August 1849. After the restoration of the Habsburg Monarchy to full authority, Hungary was placed under brutal martial law.

 # Austrian Leader Descriptions #
 ################################
 
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_BACH_DESC: "Baron Alexander von Bach serves as the Interior Minister of the Habsburg Monarchy and is the de-facto leader of Austria in the matters of internal politics. The Baron comes from a family with a long history in the matter of law, and he himself is a Doctor of Laws and a loyal servant of the Empire. Ever since he took power, in 1849 during the Revolution, he has sought to depart from Metternich's over-controlling system but at the same time has kept much of Metternich's principles in practice in his Klerikalabsolutist form of governance. The Baron favors centralizing the Empire, with Vienna as the center of everything, and to maintain loyalty to the Emperor through a rigorous use of the secret police. The Baron is also, like most Conservative members of the Government, a supporter of the Catholic Church within Austria. Even though he enjoys he the support of the Emperor and of most German-Austrians, the Baron's policies have deeply dissatisfied the other ethnic groups in the Empire, and perhaps in due time it will be revealed his policies might have done more harm than good when it comes to the loyalty of Franz Joseph's subjects..."
 POLITICS_BERNHARD_VON_RECHBERG_DESC: "Born in Regensburg in 1806, Count Johann Bernhard von Rechberg und Röthenlöwen was initially supposed to pursue the same path as his father, Count Aloys, becoming a Bavarian statesman, but fate would not see it that way. After his education at the universities of Strasbourg and Munich, he incurred the displeasure of the Bavarian King Ludwig I due to Rechberg's role in a duel. Subsequently, he transferred himself to the Austrian diplomatic service in 1828. In the following years, he was a part of the Austrian diplomatic corps in the Berlin, London, and Brussels, before being appointed envoy at Stockholm in 1841 and, two years later, in Brazil.\n\nDuring the March Revolutions of 1848/49, he was appointed Austrian plenipotentiary to the Frankfurt Parliament, convening to prepare the unification of Germany, which did not go through in the end. In 1853, he entered public service in Lombardy-Venetia, assisting Radetzky and the other rulers in the civilian administration of the Habsburg-led kingdom, before returning to Frankfurt, where he spent two years as the Austrian representative and the appointed president of the German 'Bundestag'. Now, in these trying times, the Emperor thinks that von Rechberg is the best option for solving our problems after the defeat in Italy. With his experience he would also be able to steer our policy in the German Confederation, where the dissent between Austria and Prussia has been growing over the last years. Rechberg shares the values of our former State Chancellor Klemens von Metternich and is often regarded as a pupil of the latter. This has brought von Rechberg into a favorable position in 1848, when he accompanied von Metternich on a flight to England, and right after that was appointed Austrian representative to Frankfurt during the revolution.\n\nHe thinks that Austria and Prussia need to compromise and to have good relations in order to maintain conservative dominance over Germany. As Staatsminister and Foreign Secretary he will have the opportunity to implement his policies in the Empire. He has the trust of the Emperor to solve the heated situation across the realm in favor of the government and to fix the issues his predecessor has caused, especially in regards to the current situation in Germany."
 POLITICS_AGENOR_GOLUCHOWSKI_DESC: "Count Agenor Romuald Gołuchowski was appointed to replace Baron Alexander von Bach as Interior Minister. He is a Conservative and an aristocrat from Galicia and a close advisor to the Emperor, furthermore he has had a successful tenure as Governor of Galicia where he did several projects benefitting the poor region. The Count will oversee the creation of a Constitution liberal enough to satisfy the populace. Nonetheless, he might not be charismatic enough to reconcile all the different ethnic groups within the Empire..."
 POLITICS_ANTON_VON_SCHMERLING_DESC: "Anton Ritter von Schmerling is the first Liberal Interior Minister of the Austrian Empire since the Congress of Vienna. Born in Vienna he studied law and for over twenty years served as a public servant in Lower Austria. He rose to prominence during the Revolutions of 1848 when he became President of the Confederate Diet. He supported the Government of Archduke John and quelled the revolt that broke out in Frankfurt.He returned to Vienna with the collapse of the Revolutions and became Minister of Justice until his resignation in 1851. Anton von Schmerling is a Liberal and a Centralist - he believes Austria should become a fully unitary state with a parliamentary government. While his ideas are seen with suspicion from the nobility and the Conservatives, he is seen as a man who might be able to unite the different ethnic groups under German power. The Emperor has put a lot of trust in him, and it remains to be seen what von Schmerling can accomplish." 
 POLITICS_ARCHDUKE_RAINER_DESC: "Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria is one of the several senior members of the Habsburg Monarchy. The Archduke studied law in Vienna and as most male members of the Monarchy he joined the Imperial Army. He married his cousin Archduchess Marie Karoline of Austria in 1852, which was to prove a very happy marriage. The Archduke was only mildly interested in politics, but he was seen as a perfect person to continue absolutism in the Empire by the court and so was appointed as Interior Minister by Franz Joseph. The Archduke is perhaps what the Empire needs, a pragmatic leader, though like the Emperor, perhaps slightly inert. Most of the actual power falls within the Absolutist faction within the court, and it is their job to ensure all men and women in the Empire are loyal subjects to His Majesty."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_VON_BELCREDI_DESC: "Count Richard von Belcredi was appointed to replace Anton von Schmerling as the Interior Minister. The Count stems from Margraviate of Moravia, though his family descends from Lombardy, and studied law in Prague and then Vienna. Already a member of the Landtag since 1861, he is a seasoned bureaucrat and an opponent to the so called 'Compromise' with the Hungarians. The Count instead supports that the Empire becomes federalized, though in a conservative way where the local nobles retain essentially all power, in order to combat the various separatist movements. It is ultimately up to the Emperor whether Count von Belcredi will stay for long as Interior Minister, or he will be replaced with a more accommodating politician, as Anton von Schmerling was."
 POLITICS_FRIEDRICH_FERDINAND_VON_BEUST_DESC: "Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust is an odd choice for Staatsminister, he is both a Saxon and a Protestant. Despite this, he is a clear opponent of Prussia, which so gravely offended us, as well as a very competent statesman. It is hope the Count will bring to an end the negotiations with the Magyars and restore faith to the Monarchy. It is time that misfortune ends and a new period of peace and stability is ushered..."
