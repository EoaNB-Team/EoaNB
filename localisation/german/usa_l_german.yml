# Worker Events
 
 usa.279.t: "New England Shoemakers Cut Wages!"
 usa.279.d: "Shoemaker factories within the New England region have had to cut wage significantly during the economic panic! Many workers cite these wages are insufficient to live off of, but others say they can sustain it for a temporary time. Even so, many workers are content with simply having a job since many workers were fired during the economic panic."
 usa.279.a: "Well, temporary wage cuts are understandable during this panic..."
 
 usa.281.t: "The New England Mechanics Association"
 usa.281.d: "The Panic of 1857 resulted in the temporary loss of jobs for many shoemakers. Workers were also angry at the increasing mechanization of the shoemaking process, discontent with the feeling of being replaced. When companies began hiring again, the cost of shoes went up and wages declined significantly. Many workers cited this increased revenue was solely going to the owner's pockets at the detriment of the living conditions for workers. Working hours were long, about 16 hours per day, and wages were low; men were earning only $3 a week and women just $1.\n\nThus the Mechanics Association was organized to negotiate conditions with employers, and demanded pre-panic wages or better."
 usa.281.a: "This is an issue between the company and it's workers, not the government."
 usa.281.b: "Recognize them and give this organization support!"
 
 usa.282.t: "The New England Shoemaker Strike!"
 usa.282.d: "After a week of failed attempts of negotiation between factory employers and the New England Mechanics Association, And so they walked off the job on Washington's birthday because it was a 'fitting day for a blow in favor of the cause you engage in.'\n\nReporters covered the mass meeting at Lyceum Hall in Lynn, calling it the 'largest and most enthusiastic of its kind ever held in New England.'' The workers set up committees of 100 men each to post the names of scabs, to keep order and to make sure shoes wouldn't be finished elsewhere. They then marched to their factories and handed in their tools.\n\n'I am glad to see that a system of labor prevails in New England under which laborers can strike when they want to, where they are not obliged to labor whether you pay them or not,' wrote Abraham Lincoln. 'I like a system which lets a man quit when he wants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere.'"
 usa.282.a: "Oh."
 usa.282.a: "Let's hope that doesn't inspire strikes here..."
 
 usa.283.t: "The New England Shoemaker Strike Ends!"
 usa.283.d: "There was no rowdyism, and the strike leaders strongly discouraged alcohol. The strikers enjoyed community support, with businessmen contributing money and groceries and clergy denouncing the employers from their pulpits. When Boston police arrived at the train station, a crowd of 8,000 people jeered and hissed at them.\n\nThe employers were ready to raise wages by the second week of the shoemakers  strike, but refused to recognize the union. On April 10, a thousand Lynn workers went back on the job after 30 employers agreed to raise wages by 10 percent. Some held out for a few weeks longer, but the shoemakers strike had ended.\n\nThe women had already gone back to work. Though the men supported them, they didn't include the women's wage demands in their proposals. They were concerned the employers wouldn't consider their demands if they added the women's.\n\nSome employers did sign agreements with the local unions. Most of the male workers got a raise, and unions organized where previously they hadn't existed. As the Haverhill Gazette reported, “An Association of mechanics will grow out of the movement which will doubtless do much for the protection of the laborers in their rights.”"
 usa.283.a: "Well, at least it's over..."

 USA_missouri_railroad_desc: "Fervent railroad speculation has generated a windfall for the economy and, more importantly, the Treasury. Few would mind those funds from being nudged in the right direction, especially to move more people out west. To do so, we will subsidize the construction of a new railroad in Missouri and give an easier start for the pioneers venturing outbound from Independence."

 USA_under_panic: "Panic of 1857"
 USA_under_panic_desc: "The United States is suffering under an economic collapse. The people have lost faith in the market, and the oversaturation of materials and the decline of the Californian gold rush has led to an economic crisis, exacerbated by the depression of agricultural prices with the conclusion of the Crimean War and a bubble in Railroad investments bursting!"

 USA_paper_money_war: "Confiscate the 1s!"
 USA_paper_money_war_desc: "President Buchanan believed the root cause of the panic was the issuing of paper money and the substitution of 'hard' currency. He withdrew the usage of all dollar bills with nominal values under 20$ and pushed for various legislation which punished banks that didn't meet certain levels of 'specie' reserves."
 USA_specie_payments: "Specie Payments"

##Buchanan Political tree
 USA_buchanan_deny_scott: "Intervene in Scott Case"
 USA_buchanan_deny_scott_desc: "The case of Dred Scott v. Sanford has brought the question of slavery into the headlines once again, and now, the highest court in the land is taking up the burden of answering it. To prevent a decision made along partisan lines, President-elect Buchanan sees it fit to pressure a northern justice into taking a pro-slavery stance. If he succeeds, we just might avoid calls of judicial bias against our already-fragile government."
 USA_buchanan_address_debate: "Address the Debate"
 USA_buchanan_address_debate_desc: "In the aftermath of the Scott case, long rising tensions between North and South, Free and Slave have been brought more fully into the light. Unfortunately for us, there is practically no chance of the crisis ending on it's own as Buchanan had hoped. Because of this, we must take a stance, as not committing will certainly lead to disaster. This stance will manifest in our cabinet, which we have not yet appointed. In the Cabinet, we can either favor Southern Democrats and the Northerners allied with them, or, we can appoint a compromise cabinet and hope to save our party."
 USA_doughface_cabinet: "The Doughface Cabinet"
 USA_doughface_cabinet_desc: "We should pursue a policy of appointing officials to the Cabinet whose loyalty to the president is unquestionable, specifically from the pool of Southern Democrats who strongly favor all pro-slavery causes."
 USA_inclusive_cabinet: "An Inclusive Cabinet"
 USA_inclusive_cabinet_desc: "Though it would be best if appointed officials who were strictly loyal to the President, the feud between Buchanan and the moderate Stephen Douglas, who champions the cause of 'Popular Sovereignty' or letting all states decide whether to be slave states or not, could tear our party apart."
 USA_purge_unreliables: "Purge Unreliables'"
 USA_purge_unreliables_desc: "Those members of the administration who can not be counted on must be purged, and loyalists put in their place. Buchanan historically pursued a policy of appointing officials solely for their pro-slavery leanings."
 USA_bleeding_kansas: "Bleeding Kansas"
 USA_bleeding_kansas_desc: "The controversy over whether Kansas would join as a Free State or Slave State historically drove some of the worst civil unrest in US history, with dozens murdered for being on either side of the debate in the years leading up to finally being admitted to the Union."

 USA_doughface_judicial_desc: "Part of entrenching pro-slavery sentiment in the US Government will invariably include appointing many Southern Democrats to various appellates and federal courts."
 USA_indiscriminate_opposition: "Indiscriminating Opposition"
 USA_indiscriminate_opposition_desc: "If a candidate can not be trusted to toe the party line, they must be opposed. We must view these Northern Moderate Democrats as no different from the abolitionist Republicans."
 USA_covode_committee: "The Covode Committee"
 USA_covode_committee_desc: "The Covode Committee was convened in the House of Representatives to investigate alleged abuses and corruption by the President, going so far as searching for grounds to Impeach the President and remove him from office. Though ultimately unsuccessful it served as a lightning rod for intra-party disagreements within the democratic party which ultimately potentially contributed to Buchanan's chosen successor coming in 3rd for the popular vote later that year."
 USA_buchanan_successor: "Buchanan's Successor?"
 USA_buchanan_successor_desc: "Now has come the time to choose who shall be the chosen democratic candidate to square off against the Unionist Party under Bell, and Republican Party under Lincoln, both of whom are strong contenders. We must choose a candidate best suited for this challenge."

 USA_tolerate_douglas_desc: "This feud between Buchanan and Senator Douglas is pointless and serves only to divide us in the face of our true opposition."
 USA_democrat_judicial: "Democrat Judicial"
 USA_democrat_judicial_desc: "Appointing solely Southern Democrats to the bench would best protect the cause of Slavery, but it would hurt our support amongst the northerners. We should be open to appointing worthy northerners so we appear unbiased."

It was President Monroe who demanded an end to European Colonialism in the Americas, and Buchanan seeks to follow his example."
 USA_mormon_alaska: "Mormon Alaska"
 USA_mormon_alaska_desc: "One of Buchanan's strangest ideas was an early purchase of Russian Alaska, with the intent of offering it to the Mormon Church, potentially seeing this as a clever way of both gaining land and settlers for a harsh frontier, and the Mormon's potentially would've taken such an offer, in their continual pursuit of lands where they could be left alone without threat of violence. We should see if the Russians at this time are prepared to part with such a barren waste."

 #Western Expansion Events
 usa.285.t: "Pikes Peak's Gold Rush!"
 usa.285.d: "For many years, people had suspected the mountains of Colorado contained numerous rich gold deposits. This rumor all began in 1835, when a French trapper named Eustace Carriere lost his party and ended up wandering through the mountains for many weeks. During those weeks he found many gold specimens which he later took back to New Mexico for examination. Upon examination, they turned out to be 'pure gold'. But when he tried to lead an expedition back to the location of where he found the gold, they came up short because he could not quite remember the location.\n\nBut many kept searching for the gold in those Rocky Mountains and several small parties explored the region. In July 1858, Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small placer deposit near the mouth of Little Dry Creek that yielded about 20 troy ounces (622 grams) of gold, which would start up the town of Denver.\n\nBut that discovery wouldn't be contained for long, for in the winter of last year this secret was exposed! If you want to mine gold yourself, spring is here and everyone is rushing to Denver! If you're worried that the early birds took it all, don't! The winter snow had made mining impossible, but now mining can begin!"

Mostly hunted to make leather so industries can craft machinery belts, military boots, and other goods.\n\nMany military officers go bison hunting food, but just as many shoot them purely for sport.

 usa.301.d: "Issac Stevens was a controversial governor during his time in office, for his role in compelling the Native American tribes of Washington Territory by intimidation and force to sign treaties that ceded most of their lands and rights to Stevens' government. These included the Treaty of Medicine Creek, Treaty of Hellgate, Treaty of Neah Bay, Treaty of Point Elliott, Point No Point Treaty, and Quinault Treaty. During this time, the Governor imposed martial law to better impose his will on the Indians and whites who opposed his views. The consequent political and legal battles would soon overshadow the Indian war.\n\nIn April 1856, Governor Stevens removed settlers whom he believed to be aiding the enemy (in many cases because they had married into local tribes) and placing them in the military's custody. Governor Stevens declared martial law in Pierce County in order to conduct a military trial of those settlers. He next declared martial law in Thurston County. But only the territorial legislature had the authority to declare martial law, and representatives fought Stevens' effort to abrogate their authority. A bitter political and legal battle ensued. On May 24, 1856, following a legal opinion rendered by Judge Chenoweth, ruling that Stevens had no legal power to declare martial law, Governor Stevens rescinded his proclamation in Pierce and Thurston counties.\n\nStevens did not hesitate to use his troops for vengeance, and waged a brutal winter campaign against the Yakama tribe, led by Chief Kamiakin. This, along with his unjustified execution of the Nisqually chieftain Leschi, led to widespread pleas to President Pierce to remove Stevens from his post. Two men were particularly vocal in their opposition to Stevens and his policies; territorial Judge Edward Lander and influential private citizen Ezra Meeker. While Meeker was ignored, Lander was arrested by Stevens' forces due to his opposition. Pierce refused to remove Stevens from his position, but eventually sent word to the governor expressing his disapproval. Any opposition eventually died down, as most white settlers in Washington Territory felt that Stevens was on 'their side', while they considered Meeker to be too sympathetic to Native Americans."

 USA_Focus_ACW_March_to_Sea_desc: "General Ulysses S. Grant has noted the importance of cutting the traitors in half, with his campaign towards Vicksburg along the Mississippi proving so.

 USA_Focus_ACW_Operation_Cradle: "Operation Cradle"
 USA_Focus_ACW_Operation_Cradle_desc: "Despite our best efforts to cut off the Confederacy, the rebel menace has been able to deploy 'blockade-runners' that are able to simply speed past our blockading ships.

The two he recommended starting with are Mobile and Charleston."

McClellan, a promising young captain from Pennsylvania who chose to stay with the Union when the North rebelled and a top candidate for Lee's Second-In-Command.

He's known for refusing an order to withdraw in the assault of Chapultepec Castle as a second lieutenant of the 1st U.S. Artillery Regiment. Famously, his decision resulted in a relieving brigade being able to exploit an advantage he created and capture the castle. His reputation for aggressiveness will surely help us put down the rebels."

 USA_ACW_Second_In_Command_Buchanan_desc: "Franklin Buchanan, a navy officer and the guy behind the creation of the United States Naval Academy. Buchanan's insight as a member of the Navy for over 46 years will surely help us win the vital naval war in the Atlantic."

 USA_Focus_ACW_Jackson_Tear_Up_Railroads_desc: "General Jackson has a plan to deal a finishing blow to the North.

 usa.248.t: "The Utah War"
 usa.248.d: "The Utah War, also known as the Mormon War for the the participation of the Mormon Church, was a brief period of political instability between the Utah Territorial Government and the US Federal Government. There were many causes, including a long history of religious oppression against the Mormon people, including being driven out of more eastern states by state-sanctioned violence, the duality of governance in the territory between the federally directed government and the ecclesiastic government of the church, and by a gross ineptitude of communication and mistrust between both sides. The actual start of the conflict started when newly elected James Buchanan appointed a new governor for the territory, replacing the then current governor who was also the head of the Mormon Church, and dispatching a military escort with policing powers. The Mormons feared a new wave of federal persecution, and so refused to admit the new governor to the territory without conflict. Historically both sides eventually reached a diplomatic settlement that saw the Mormons' rights, never in real danger, respected, and federal authority respected and transition of power to a new governor."
 usa.248.a: " \"Choose The Right!\""
 USA_utah_war.1.t: "Preperation of an Expedition to Utah"
 USA_utah_war.1.d: "One of the campaign promises of President James Buchanan was extensive denunciation of the practice of polygamy, alongside the Mormon governance of the Territory of Utah. Almost immediately after his inauguration, Buchanan announced a successor to the current Governor of Utah, Brigham Young. Although a successor has yet to be found, the President has declared Utah to be in a state of rebellion, and currently mobilizes a posse comitatus that will accompany the successor to Utah to ensure a transition takes place, and that there is peace after said change. This detachment is under the lead of Colonel Edmund Alexander, being that General William S. Harney was not able to take command due to his involvement in the conflict regarding both pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers in the Kansas Territory."
 USA_utah_war.1.a: "Let's hope they aren't needed"
 USA_utah_war.2.t: "Alfred Cumming is the successor"
 USA_utah_war.2.d: "After months of Buchanan's offer being declined, he has now officially found a successor for Brigham Young in the Utah Territory. This man is Georgian Democrat Alfred Cumming. He was previously a mayor of his hometown, Augusta, Georgia. Alongside serving as a sutler to former President Zachary Taylor, who was then a general, during the Mexican-American War, Cumming was also the superintendent of the Upper Missouri Indian Superintendency for a time. He is set to leave in a little over a week, accompanied by forces made up of the 1st US Cavalry, the 2nd Dragoons, and the 6th Infantry Regiment."
 USA_utah_war.2.a: "Good luck!"
 USA_utah_war.3.t: "The Mountain Meadows Massacre"
 USA_utah_war.3.d: "Tragedy strikes Mountain Meadows, Utah! An estimated number of around 120 to 140 members of the Baker-Fancher emigrant wagon train have been killed. The wagon originating in Arkansas was heading to California, however, when it was passing through the Utah Territory, a Paiute warband attacked it. No survivors were found."
 USA_utah_war.3.a: "The horror!"
#  USA_utah_war.4.t: "Buchanan Dispatches A Moderate Military Escort"
#  USA_utah_war.4.d: "After consulting with the Secretary of War and other high ranking officers of the US Army concerning current military commitments, the President has decided to dispatch a medium sized military escort."
#  USA_utah_war.4.a: "Nothing wrong with being prepared"
 USA_utah_war.5.t: "Ambush!"
 USA_utah_war.5.d: "As we progressed towards Utah, we found that the grass had been burnt. To make matters worse, a band of Mormon cavalry has attacked three of our supply caravans, ending with them destroyed and the horses and cattle with them were stolen. It's a major blow, and it's unknown if any shots were exchanged at all during this, with the lack of cavalry, the men will be more on-alert."
 USA_utah_war.5.a: "Those pests!"
 USA_utah_war.6.t: "Jackass Calvalry"
 USA_utah_war.6.d: "In a somewhat comical, yet seemingly desperate attempt, Colonel Alexander, who gained the nickname of "Old Granny", gathered one hundred of his men and mounted them on army mules to combat the Mormon militias. He rode this "jackass calvalry" to an engagement with the enemy to where they fired at them from afar, yet seemingly no casualties resulted from it."
 USA_utah_war.6.a: "What are our men doing?"
 USA_utah_war.7.t: "Johnston Assumes Command"
 USA_utah_war.7.d: "Colonel Johnston has finally arrived to take command of the expedition. Although known to be more aggressive than the former commander, Colonel Alexander, the lack of supplies and coming winter has put a halt to any plans for progression. Instead, near the remains of Fort Bridger, they set up Camp Scott and Camp Eckelsville."
 USA_utah_war.7.a: "It's better to play things smart."
 USA_utah_war.8.t: "Newspapers reporting the Utah War"
 USA_utah_war.8.d: "As early as September, Newspapers have been publishing articals on the issues we've been having with the Utah Territory. Though seemingly, some of them are promoting what seems to be hysteria or simply rumors. Some of them say that the Mormons will plan to make an exodus to British Columbia, the Russian Possession of Alaska, or even the Mexican Province of Sonora. This seems like this will cause some issues internationally."
 USA_utah_war.8.a: "Oh no..."
 USA_utah_war.9.t: "Alfred Cumming Arrives"
 USA_utah_war.9.d: "Not long after setting up the two camps, they were joined by the 2nd Dragoons, who was accompanied by the future governor, Alfred Cumming. Unfortunately, the were lacking in supplies as well, therefore there was no reinforcement to the encampments. Cumming, now officialy sent a proclamation to the citizens of Utah, declaring them to be in rebellion. Forming a grand jury within Camp Scott, which indicted two Mormon prisoners, Brigham Young, and over 60 members of the Mormon hierarchy with the charge of treason."
 USA_utah_war.9.a: "At least everyone is now here."
 USA_utah_war.10.t: "Kane contacts Buchanan"
 USA_utah_war.10.d: "Thomas L. Kane was contacted by Buchanan as early as August, seeking help for the situation regarding the Utah Territory. Kane was known to have aided the Mormons in their trek westwards and with subsequent political controversies. Buchanan now has received letter from Kane stating that he has intentions to help mediate the issue between the Mormons and Brigham Young on behalf of Buchanan and the US government. Buchanan had previously planned to try and increase the size of the Regular Army to combat them, although a defeat would come with political costs. Therefore he stated that he would pardon them, should they submit to government authority. Kane then left for Utah, albeit he was an unoffical mediator."
 USA_utah_war.10.a: "Maybe there is hope?"
 USA_utah_war.11.t: "Negotiations regarding the Sale of Alaska"
 USA_utah_war.11.d: "Edward A. de Stoeckel, the Russian Minister to Washington, has come to us with the proposition that Russia was amendable to selling the land that is Alaska. It can be assumed that the newspapers could have played some part in to this push. Maybe this could help us relocate the Mormon population further away from us? If not that, it seems to allow us to push further west, regardless, the land is seemingly all frozen. So what use could it all be?"
 USA_utah_war.11.a: "We shall try to pursue such an option."
 USA_utah_war.11.b: "It is too much of a risk, for too little reward."
 USA_utah_war.12.t: "The Second Front"
 USA_utah_war.12.d: "Based on rumors that the Mormons would try to escape down the Colorado River into the Mexican Province of Sonora, the War Department was now considering of utilizing a second front against the Mormons due to increased hostilities. They put up Lieutenant Joseph Ives to embark on an expedition to determine the feasibility of transporting troops and supplies up the Colorado River by steamer in order to quickly reach the mouth of the Virgin River. From the rumors of Native unrest, a second expedition was also formed, commanded by a merchant, George Johnson."
 USA_utah_war.12.a: "They can't run now!"
 USA_utah_war.13.t: "Kane Returns"
 USA_utah_war.13.d: "Thomas Kane has reached Colonel Johnston's encampment with seemingly good news! Although Kane and Johnston had poor relations, he went to the new governor, Alfred Cumming, and managed to convince him to accompany Kane back to Salt Lake City. It appears as if Kane has successfully convinced Brigham Young of relinquishing the Governorship to Cumming."
 USA_utah_war.13.a: "It all seems to be ending soon."
 USA_utah_war.14.t: "Ives encounters a band of Mormons"
 USA_utah_war.14.d: "While Ives' Expedition was continuing, they seemed to have encountered what seemed to be a Mormon renegade, though his deception did not last long as one of the members of the expedition recognized the man as a Mormon bishop. High tensions pursued due to the war hysteria between the two groups of men."
 USA_utah_war.14.a: "Let's hope this is the last of the deception."
 USA_utah_war.15.t: "Buchanan's Proclamation"
 USA_utah_war.15.d: ""Now, therefore, I, James Buchanan, President of the United States, have thought proper to issue this my proclamation, enjoining upon all public officers in the Territory of Utah to be diligent and faithful, to the full extent of their power, in the execution of the laws; commanding all citizens of the United States in said Territory to aid and assist the officers in the performance of their duties; offering to the inhabitants of Utah who shall submit to the laws a free pardon for the seditions and treasons heretofore by them committed; warning those who shall persist, after notice of this proclamation, in the present rebellion against the United States that they must expect no further lenity, but look to be rigorously dealt with according to their deserts; and declaring that the military forces now in Utah and hereafter to be sent there will not be withdrawn until the inhabitants of that Territory shall manifest a proper sense of the duty which they owe to this Government.""
 USA_utah_war.15.a: "A hopeful end to violence."
 USA_utah_war.16.t: "Alfred Cumming instated as Governor"
 USA_utah_war.16.d: "As Cumming and Kane descended the Echo Canyon on their way to Salt Lake City, Cumming was dismayed by the actual size of the Mormon forces lining it. Seemingly being fooled, expecting much more. Though later upon entering the city, he was courteously received by both Young and the citizenry. Having been successfully instated as the new Governor of the Utah Territory."
 USA_utah_war.16.a: "A conclusion to a political tragedy."
 USA_utah_war.17.t: "Johnston's Expedition arrives and sets up Camp Floyd"
 USA_utah_war.17.d: "Colonel Johnston and his forces have now arrived and entered the city unhindered. Although, they were seemingly not pleased by the outcome of these events. Johnston was quoted to saying that he would have given "his plantation for a chance to bombard the city for fifteen minutes". Another, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Smith, was heard saying that he "did not care a damm who heard him; he would like to see every dammed Mormon hung by the neck." They later set up Camp Floyd in a valley a distance away, in means of reducing conflcit from the soldiers and the Mormon population."
 USA_utah_war.17.a: "They will have to make do."
 

 USA_utah_war.93.t: "US Army Successfully Forces Echo Canyon!" #US wins border war
 USA_utah_war.93.d: "Despite the thousands of defenders and fortifications, our boys in blue carried the day, driving the Nauvoo Legion before them, and capturing Salt Lake City. Though the Mormon Leadership has escaped for now, and the Nauvoo Legion is not yet destroyed, there is now no way to prevent US forces from entering the territory and taking it by storm."
 USA_utah_war.94.t: "US Army Fails To Take Echo Canyon!"
 USA_utah_war.94.d: "Despite superiority of numbers for the US Army, the Mormon defenses are revealed to be the deciding factor! The US Army has been stopped cold by the Nauvoo Legion, and a severe shift in tensions has occurred because of this outbreak of hostilities. If a peaceful solution isn't found soon, outright war could break out, and it is not clear now if we could win."
 USA_utah_war.94.a: "Dev here, asking how did you manage to F that up?"
 USA_utah_war.95.t: "Victory In Utah!"
 USA_utah_war.95.d: "After a period of military action and confrontations between the US Army and the Nauvoo Legion, the US has emerged victorious, though politically embarrassed. This whole situation could've been avoided but for now the US must work to forcefully reintegrate the territory by force with a restive local population."
 USA_utah_war.95.a: "Vae victis"
 USA_utah_war.96.t: "Us Gives Up On Utah"
 USA_utah_war.96.d: "Despite the eruption of hostilities recently between the Mormon Church and the Federal Government, and the apparent disparity of forces involved, the US government has essentially given up. Be it military failures or a new political strategy, they seem to have decided they will no longer pursue the reintegration of Utah by force at this time. The people of Utah might feel safe for now but how long can this peace last?"
 USA_utah_war.96.a: "As long as it can. But seriously, how did you fail so hard?"
 USA_utah_war.97.t: "US Loses Control of Utah!"

 USA_utah_war.99.d2: "After lengthy negotiations and compromises on both sides, there is finally Peace in Utah! Alfred Cummings will assume the Governorship of the Utah Territory, the rights of the Mormons will be respected, and Federal forces will enter the territory to assume their policing duties, and to guard against native attacks.

Now he wishes to purchase the Island of Cuba from the Spanish Government, not only to expand America, but also to add another potential slave state to the US to grow support for slavery in the US Senate.

Previous decades of religious persecution of the Mormons made them suspicious of this change in governorship, especially since it came with no warning or explanation, and what appeared to be an occupying army.\n\nMormon Unrest stands at: §R[?Root.USA_mormon_unrest]§!\n\nWe must endeavor to keep unrest below §R18§! or the Mormons will certainly revolt."
 
 USA_paraguay_intervention: "The Paraguay Expedition"
 USA_paraguay_intervention_desc: "It being desirable to ascertain the fitness of the river La Plata and its tributaries for navigation by steam, the United States steamer Water Witch was sent thither for that purpose in 1853. This was successfully carried on until February 1855, when, whilst in the peaceful prosecution of her voyage up the Parana River, the steamer was fired upon by a Paraguayan fort. The fire was returned, but as the Water Witch was of small force and not designed for offensive operations, she retired from the conflict. The pretext upon which the attack was made was a decree of the President of Paraguay of October 1854, prohibiting foreign vessels of war from navigating the rivers of that State. As Paraguay, however, was the owner of but one bank of the river of that name, the other belonging to Corientes, a State of the Argentine Confederation, the right of its Government to expect that such a decree would be obeyed can not be acknowledged. But the Water Witch was not, properly speaking, a vessel of war. She was a small steamer engaged in a scientific enterprise intended for the advantage of commercial states generally. Under these circumstances I am constrained to consider the attack upon her as unjustifiable and as calling for satisfaction from the Paraguayan Government. Citizens of the United States also who were established in business in Paraguay have had their property seized and taken from them, and have otherwise been treated by the authorities in an insulting and arbitrary manner, which requires redress"
 USA_character_james_buchanan_desc: "The 15th President of the United States, James Buchanan, is a member of the Democratic Party. Despite being a northerner, he is claimed to have pro-southern principles, this has lead to many people calling him a "doughface". Deeming northern abolitionist parties and groups to be troublesome in interfering in what he believed would be the natural gradual abolition of slavery in the south. He believes it to be futile to stop the expansion of the nation, with people attempting to settle out west over the Rockies. Though he also had some of his own ideas in regards to expansion that he hopes to come to fruition during his term."
 USA_characters_john_breckinridge_advisor_desc: "Vice President to James Buchanan, John Cabell Breckinridge is a member of the Democratic Party. On the ongoing issue of slavery, Breckinridge is torn from his morals and upholding the constitution. He believes that the institute of slavery is evil, yet still protects it due to slaves' status as property, and the constitution protects one's rights to their own property. He is also an advocate of manifest destiny. During the last election, he emphasized his belief that the Republican party would tear the nation apart."
 USA_character_roger_taney_desc: "The 5th Chief Justice, Roger Brooke Taney, was appointed by former Democratic President Andrew Jackson. He was widely respected and people believed he was going to settle the national debate over slavery. However, as we know from the recent Dred Scott case, it only bolstered the Republican party, garnering anger from north due to the decision. This ultimately could be because of his support of slavery."
 USA_character_lewis_cass_desc: "The 22nd Secretary of State, Lewis Cass, is a member of the Democratic Party. He is a veteran of the War of 1812, reaching the rank of brigadier general, and participating in the Battle of the Thames. Under President Andrew Jackson, he was appointed as Secretary of War and aided his policy of Indian Removal. In regards to the issues of slavery, he's an advocate for popular sovereignty."
 USA_character_howell_cobb_desc: "The 22nd Secretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb, is a member of the Democratic Party. He sided with former Democratic President Andrew Jackson on the question of nullification and was a passionate advocate for the extension of slavery but came around to support the Compromise of 1850."
 USA_character_john_floyd_desc: "The 24th Secretary of War, John Buchanan Floyd, is a member of the Democratic Party. He is pro-slavery and almost got in trouble, as governor of Virginia, when he recommended to the Virginia General Assembly to pass a law taxing imports from states refusing to return fugitive slaves owned by Virginian masters. This would have violated the Interstate Commerce Clause."
 USA_character_jeremiah_black_desc: "The 24th Attorney General, Jeremiah Sullivan Black, is a member of the Democratic Party. He gradually became one of the leading American lawyers, serving as a Chief Justice on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court."
