 #§YWelcome to the End of a New Beginning!§!\n§g !!! Please read the ingame wiki (the \"?\" in the upper right corner) before playing !!!§!\n EoaNB is a total-conversion mod with aims of simulating World History from 1857 onwards. We are still in §REarly Alpha§!, so expect incomplete content and/or a variety of bugs. However, the team is always doing its best to polish and improve the mod!\n \n If you are interested in staying up to date with daily development, join our §GDiscord Server§! and check out our §GDevelopment GitHub§!:\nPlease note that §Ypeople with smaller screens§! may experience an issue with the research interface where not all the folders are displayed. This can be circumvented by going into your options and lowering the UI Scale modifier. To verify that you can see all technology folders, please check whether the rightmost folder is called \"Special Projects\". If that is the case, all the folders are displayed on your screen.\n\nUsers with low-end PCs may also experience §Rsignificant lag or even crashes§! when playing on speed 5 (maximum speed). The lag can be fought by using the §Y\"Unite Africa\"§! option in the options menu, while, if you crash, you can try to reload and play the month on speed 4.\n\nThanks for playing our mod and we hope you will enjoy it!\n — §WThe EoaNB Team§!"
