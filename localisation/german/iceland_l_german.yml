 ICE_weather_problem:0 "The Migration Problem"
 ICE_weather_problem_desc:0 "A harsh climate, poor soil, and recently, a great eruption at Askja, has led to a great number of people leaving Iceland in search of a more hospitable land in the Americas. While understandable, this is a great issue with our already small population becoming smaller as a result. This must be handled with haste!"
 ICE_new_iceland:0 ""New Iceland""
 ICE_new_iceland_desc:0 "The migrants leaving Iceland have largely decided to settle a new area in Western Canada they dub "New Iceland". Localized close to Lake Winnipeg, they have made a new settlement they call Gimli.

 ICE_dont_worry_better_weather_soon_desc:0 "Iceland and its people has weathered many, many environmental hazards and disasters before, and this is no different.

 ICE_give_out_warmer_clothes:0 "Help the afflicted"
 ICE_give_out_warmer_clothes_desc:0 "The environment is unforgiving in Iceland, this our people have known since Ingólfr Arnarson himself stepped foot on its soil.

 ICE_limmit_emigration:0 "Limit emmigration"
 ICE_limmit_emigration_desc:0 "The amount of emmigration the nation is experiencing at the moment is too much to bear. We cannot in good faith stop the people from trying to find a better life... However, we can always fix the books a bit and slow down the bureaucratic process to limit the amount of people leaving by such means until we get a better handle on the situation..."
 ICE_patrol_boats:0 "Patrol boats on the West Coast"

 ICE_border_control:0 "Border control"

 ICE_our_military_buget_desc:0 "Iceland has not seen much fighting since the times of the Icelandic Commonwealth, but that does not preclude us from the realm of conflict. There may come a time when Iceland's sovereignty is challenged by a foreign foe. We must be ready for such a possibility."
 ICE_copy_danish_designs:0 "Copy Danish designs"
 ICE_copy_danish_designs_desc:0 "The Danes and us have a mixed relationship. That, however, does not mean we can't learn a thing or two from them. We will copy some designs of theirs; surely they won't mind."
 ICE_copy_british_ironclads:0 "Copy British ironclads"
 ICE_copy_british_ironclads_desc:0 "The British are the undisputed masters of the sea. Their designs reflect that supremacy, and thus, is highly useful to copy!"
 ICE_train_on_the_watters:0 "Exercises at sea"

 ICE_buy_guns_from_usa_desc:0 "The Americans are proud of their right to bear arms and have no shortage of small arms to bring to bear; or to sell, for that matter. Let us approach them as our suppliers for weapons."

 ICE_icelandic_army_doctrine:0 "Doctrine of the Herfylkingin"
 ICE_icelandic_army_doctrine_desc:0 "An army cannot fight with excellence if the army fighting does not know what its objective is. By defining the role of our army, as well as the means, tactics and strategy to achieving that role, we will know exactly how we must fight."
 ICE_take_civilian_weppons_to_nationalstockpile:0 "Requisition private arms"
 ICE_take_civilian_weppons_to_nationalstockpile_desc:0 "We do not necessarily have all the weapons we need to supply the army... An alternative could be to requisition private weapons in possession of our citizens. This will not be popular, though why would civilians need arms?"

 ICE_remain_as_puppet:0 "Remain a Danish Territory"
 ICE_remain_as_puppet_desc:0 "Iceland cannot stand on its own legs. Be it our small population, our small economy or our dependence on foreign imports to survive, it is clear that Iceland cannot survive by its own power.

 ICE_usa_support_us_desc:0 "We are making ourselves heard in the matter of our independence, with discussions active across the land.

Perhaps we could mobilize the Icelandic community in the US to lobby for our freedom?"
 ICE_get_support_from_the_althing:0 "Seek Alþingi support"
 ICE_get_support_from_the_althing_desc:0 "Regarded as perhaps the oldest surviving parliament in the world, the Alþingi is of exceeding importance to the new Icelandic state we are attempting to create.
