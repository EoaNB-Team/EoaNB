This will not be easy, as our nation lacks many of the resources and material required for modern warfare.

We will grant him full power to reform our army as he sees fit, and will attempt to adopt his proposals to the best of our ability.

The Austrians are no friends of our nation, and we cannot guarantee they will not decide to assist our enemies at some point. If this occurs, and they can march through the north without anything impeding them, we would only have ourselves to blame. Instead, we will construct fortifications along the Danube, and protect ourselves from such a future. We will not give that future a chance to exist, and instead we will protect against as many possibilities as we can."

In case any war broke out, it would be an immediate target, and as one of the traditional capitals of the nation, losing Belgrade would be crushing. To prevent this we must construct fortifications in the area around Belgrade, blocking any assault or attempt to occupy the city for some time."

The greatest of these locations will be a new cannon foundry, which will be established to provide our army with the artillery it requires, and meet many of its other needs for materiel. While some may say this will only further reinforce the current status we have granted Kragujevac, as a center of military production, we are only too happy to see this occur, as such a center is highly useful for us."

The virtues of modern rifles are extensive, and their adoption could be the difference between any wars we fight failing and succeeding. Our small nation, with a fittingly small number of soldiers needs every advantage it can acquire, and modern rifles are among the most important. Our best hope will be to seek out foreign inventors or firms, and attempt to purchase rifles or the designs for rifles directly, but finding a source will only be the beginning."

    SER_contract_with_belgian_desc: "Though Belgium may seem a strange source for weapons, as it has been involved in far fewer wars than its neighbors, it has produced many fine designers of weapons in recent years. We may find that these inventors, their companies, and possibly even the Belgian government will be eager to make deals with us to export large numbers of weapons. Such a deal would be a boon to both our economies, although the designs may seem less tested to our eyes."

With a Frenchman as our Minister of Defense, we may find the French amenable to our needs. There are many designs that we could pursue adopting for our soldiers, and they will likely meet our needs very well. However, we must hope that companies that are capable of meeting our needs are willing to deal with us, and that we can afford the costs they demand."

This new rifle should be able to meet many of our current needs, and has been created specifically for our own uses. We hope that it will be able to be produced in the numbers and with the quality we require for our military, and that its delivery will come at such a time that is still useful and would not need to be replaced by a new and more modern rifle once again."
    
    SER_stragari_gunpowder: "Stragari Gunpowder Magazine"
    SER_stragari_gunpowder_desc: "Ever since the First Serbian Uprising, the Gunpowder Magazine at Stragari has been highly important, and this status has continued for decades. However, it has often been used only to store gunpowder, rather than to produce it. With an ever expanding army we cannot simply stockpile gunpowder at such a location, and we will need to produce our own to meet our great needs. And so we will convert the gunpowder magazine to no longer simply be a repository for gunpowder, but rather a source from now on."

    SER_artillery_administration_law_desc: "Our current administration of our artillery production is organized too poorly for our needs. To rectify this issue we will join our production and storage capacities together, ensuring that they are directly run together, and we will formally designate Kragujevac as our center for military production. These changes will allow our factories to better meet our needs, and should allow us to begin to expand our production from its current state."

    SER_artillery_school_desc: "In 1850 the Artillery School was formally founded, but it has not always been staffed as well as we would like. We will invite officers from the Austrian army, particularly those of Serbian origin, and have them teach our own officers, and the next generations of officers, how best to use artillery and many other necessary skills for a military career. This effort will be František-Franjo Zah and he will be appointed as its first director, and it will grant us excellent officers educated within our own nation."

    SER_la_hitte_cannons_desc: "With our newly expanded and reformed artillery in a satisfactory state, we should begin adopting more modern pieces for our batteries. These will be using the La Hitte system from France, which though still muzzle-loaded uses shells rather than older forms of ammunition. This change will grant our artillery far greater destructive capabilities, and it will serve our soldiers far better than our previous cannons."
    
    SER_serbian_gendarmerie: "Serbian Gendarmerie"
    SER_serbian_gendarmerie_desc: "Following the French model, we will create a Gendarmerie of our own, to deter crime in our provinces and grant the government greater control across the nation. This unit will be composed of a relatively small number of soldiers, but it will be sufficient to meet our current needs for policing, and if necessary their numbers could be further expanded to meet any new needs."
    
    SER_military_uniform_regulation: "Military Uniforms Regulation"
    SER_military_uniform_regulation_desc: "Several of our French officials and advisors have stated that instituting a regulation for military uniforms, similar to what the French have adopted, would benefit our army and its discipline. Following this advice, we will institute a formal regulation which will grant our soldiers a proper modern uniform, that will be both practical and represent our governments needs. This effort should grant us a level of uniformity that will assist our soldiers in performing their tasks."
    
    SER_french_medical_officer: "French Medical Officers"
    SER_french_medical_officer_desc: "Our relations with the French have been positive for many years, and their influence has constantly guided our reforms. We will now invite further direct assistance from the French, in a different area of our military; the medical. These doctors will be able to teach our own physicians many of their skills, experiences, and methods of applying these resources to a military. This expertise will grant our army a far better ability to treat its soldiers, and will persist for decades."
    
    SER_blaznavac_war_minister: "Appoint Blaznavac as the Minister of War"
    SER_blaznavac_war_minister_desc: "Having administered the cannon factory at Kragujevac well for several years, Milivoje Blaznavac represents an excellent candidate for the minister of war. Hiplot Mondain has exceeded his original obligation to stay in Serbia, and has served our nation extremely well during his time here. He will return home to France, and we will appoint Blaznavac as his successor. Blaznavac has had an unsteady relationship with the royal family, but he has been returned into their favor, and his connections to the royal family combined with his respectable military career make him our choice for war minister."

    SER_army_political_influence_desc: "Serbian politics is often chaotic, and this is exemplified in the reigns of our princes. Our state has not existed long, and yet it has its monarchs expelled and returned multiple times. Let us use our newest institution as a balancing influence, to grant greater stability to our political processes. We can only hope that this decision will achieve its desired goal, and will not destabilize our current situation even further."
    
    SER_corruption_affair: "Corruption Affair"
    SER_corruption_affair_desc: "With the continual expansion of our army many of our soldiers have been left behind, as focus has been centered on the artillery or other divisions.

    SER_belgrade_military_drills_desc: "An army without drills and without training is worthless. In order to ensure our soldiers are able to fight properly and are maintaining the discipline we require of them we will conduct extensive drills in Belgrade. However, there is another purpose to these drills. They will grant our new minister of war the opportunity to gain control of the politics of Serbia, and to achieve his goals, should he live long enough to see this occur."

We will put this assistance to use wherever we can, but it will be particularly focused on improving our military industry."

The detachment was given the name "Legion" in early June 1862, when it took part in the armed clashes with the Turks at Varoš kapija and Vidin kapija in Belgrade. Subsequently, it defended a section of the Serbian positions in the city, and some of the Bulgarian volunteers were sent to Kragujevac, led by Ilyo Markov. However, the failure of the Hadjistavreva Buna interrupted plans for an uprising in Bulgaria. Theft of the funds raised and unsuccessful negotiations for funding from the Bulgarian communities in Braila and Vienna left the legion with very few weapons and forced it to go on Serbian state maintenance at the end of August."

After the Principality of Serbia was formally established, there were many different foreign coins in circulation. Eventually, Prince Miloš Obrenović decided to introduce some order by establishing exchange rates based on the groat as money of account. In 1819 Miloš published a table rating 43 different foreign coins, 10 gold, 28 silver, and 5 copper. After the last Ottoman garrisons were withdrawn in 1867, Serbia was faced with multiple currencies in circulation. Thus, the prince Mihailo Obrenović ordered a national currency to be minted. In 1868, bronze coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, and 10 paras.

Nearby Serbs and Turks, as well as several Serbian gendarmes, immediately arrived at the scene. Turkish soldiers tried to escape, but the Gendarmeries detained them and called the police chief Mihajlo Barlovac. Barlovac sent several more policemen to the scene along with the interpreter Simo Nesic. The Turkish soldiers involved in the incident were afraid that the civilians who arrived at the scene would beat them. They were taken to the Serbian police under guard, and the wounded apprentice was sent home. While passing by their barracks, i.e. Turkish police buildings, the Turkish soldiers tried to escape, but were stopped by Sima Nesic and Gendarme George Nishli.

Immediately after the shooting, a general alarm was raised in Belgrade. The Turks barricaded themselves in all four city gates, in taverns and mosques. The Serbs, in turn, set out to arm themselves and occupy the Turkish gates. The Turkish Pasha then dispatched a strong force from the fortress and sent it to the Turkish barracks. Apparently, they were to attack the Serbian police and the charshiya. Prime Minister Ilija Garashanin detected the unit and since there were armed saints around, he persuaded them to return, guaranteeing their safe return. Along with them, he sent some Serbian Gendarmeries. However, there was a commotion in the city itself and the people were outraged by the Turks, and besides, the saint was encouraged by Joka Vlajkovic. On the return of the Turkish unit, someone in the crowd killed a Turkish officer, a company commander. Then the Turkish soldiers shot and killed several Serbs. "

After capturing the three gates, the Turks remained comforted in the Stambol Gate. Nikola Christo ordered the Varosh Gate and the Sawa Gate to be razed to the ground overnight. Tekiyas and mosques were also captured, some by negotiation. Many Turks attempted to capture the Belgrade fortresses with their families in turmoil.

However, an even greater crisis occurred and the ceasefire was broken on Tuesday, June, when the Turks began a several-hour bombardment of Belgrade with a cannon march after the solemn funeral of the dead. On this occasion the roof of the Metropolitan Church, the bell tower of the Cathedral and the Captain Mishino building were damaged. The Italian Consulate "Serbian Crown", where the French Consul was living at the time, was also affected. Later the city government found that as many as 396 houses had been hit and that fifty Serbs had been killed. Most of the consuls, except the Austrian, sided with the Serbs, believing that they gave no grounds for bombing. The Serbian Government used this event to demand the expulsion of the Turks from Serbia, but at a conference of the guaranteeing powers in the Constantinople suburb of Kalanca, held in July, it was decided to expel only Turkish civilians and to retain the Turkish urban garrisons.

The Knyaz addressed the assembly with "God help me, Lord", and the assembly responded with "God help you, Lord". The knyaz then announces to the congregation that his leader will read her the prepared sermon. The sermon was read by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ljubomir Petrovich. After reading the sermon, the knyaz declared the assembly open, and withdrew, accompanied by ministers and the world. The Assembly decided that the Prince should resign. A letter was written to the knyaz in which the Assembly, on behalf of the people, asked the Prince to resign the dignity of Prince of Serbia and to hand over his power to the National Assembly.

"Together with this letter was enclosed the resignation which the Prince was to sign, and both acts were taken to court by a deputation of the Assembly headed by him. The Prince accepted the deputation and asked to come tomorrow morning after his resignation. That evening, however, the knyaz , accompanied by Ilija Garashanin, left for the city of Belgrade, and the assembly, without waiting for his written resignation, excluded him by one decision from the princely dignity.

Prince Mihailo Obrenović recognized him, because of a dispute over his brother Ljubomir. The last words of the Prince, which Kosta himself admitted when on trial were: Well, it's true. Mihailo and Anka were shot dead, and Katarina wounded. Further details of the plot behind the assassination have never been clarified; the sympathizers and cousins of the Karađorđević dynasty were suspected of being behind the crime, but this has not been proven."

For the next two years, Sava Grujić organized more major reforms in the army, improving her fighting capacity and giving her a new organization, Grujić realized that it was necessary to stiffen the back of the Serbian militia, so he split the standing army, which had seen little action during the first war, into smaller units that acted as cadres for the larger units of the militia. The troops were led by capable Serbian officers who proved their heroism and tactical ability. In 1876 King Milan had kept the standing army out of combat, fearing to commit the troops he saw primarily as protection for his dynasty, but Grujić reorganization turned it into the backbone of a considerably improved Serbian fighting force."
