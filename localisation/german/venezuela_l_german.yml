VEN_jtm_prohibit_child_labor:0 "Prohibit Child Labor"

VEN_jtm_make_the_preparations_desc:0 "Preparing ourselves and striking first is the most convenient option. If the caudillos notice we're making reforms, they'll know we are going to attack them.

The only thing keeping us from falling apart is the northern part of the country. If we fall behind, we will be a mere memory of what could've been a great country."
VEN_urb_southern_venezuela:0 "The Southern Cities"
VEN_urb_southern_venezuela_desc:0 "The cities in the south of Venezuela are very deep in the heart of Venezuela, surrounded by wilderness. As a centralized country, these cities have never been properly developed, contrary to our cities in the north. It is not a bad idea to try and better this part of our country, perhaps we are standing above a gold mine and we don't know it yet."
VEN_urb_caracas:0 "Urbanization of Caracas"
VEN_urb_caracas_desc:0 "Caracas has been our beautiful capital city ever since the time of the Viceroyalty of Venezuela, except for that Gran Colombia parenthesis, and it must always be our focus and most important city. After all, what is a nation if its capital is still stuck in the middle ages? Caracas will stay great, we must make sure of that."
VEN_urb_maracaibo:0 "Urbanization of Maracaibo"
VEN_urb_maracaibo_desc:0 "Maracaibo is the second biggest and most important city of our nation. Perhaps it might even beat Caracas some day. While our capital is our most important focus, our other remarkable cities are a must in our list of progress. Who knows, we might even find interesting resources that will make us rich down in this city, right?"
VEN_urb_ciudad_bolivar:0 "Urbanization of Ciudad Bolívar"
VEN_urb_ciudad_bolivar_desc:0 "Ciudad Bolívar is at the heart of our nation, digged deep down in our nation. While often forgotten, it is still a remarkable city that we should procure to keep in line. Our nation can't stand with only two cities, planning ahead is a good thing."
VEN_urb_san_fernando:0 "Urbanization of San Fernando"
VEN_urb_san_fernando_desc:0 "Hidden in the beauty of los llanos of Venezuela, San Fernando stands as an exceptional city in our list. Perhaps not the prettiest, biggest or most populated, but that might change soon, we just need to put a little effort into it. Maintaining these cities can't be forgotten."
VEN_modernize_our_nation:0 "Modernize our Nation"
VEN_modernize_our_nation_desc:0 "For too long has our nation fallen behind our neighbors in South America. The world is changing, and we must adapt. Although it might hurt to say goodbye to the old ways and cities, it will hurt more if we don't start modernizing now. We can also choose not to, and waste our nation's potential, which will come back to bite in the future."
VEN_look_to_britain:0 "Look to Britain"
VEN_look_to_britain_desc:0 "The British Empire is the most powerful and influential nation in the world right now. If we want to modernize, we need to look around us first, and the best way to do so is looking at the best nation in the world and our neighbor. This will open up many possibilities for us and maintain us in the competition. We juts need to keep our heads in the clouds and our feet in the ground."
VEN_look_to_prussia:0 "Look to Prussia"
VEN_look_to_prussia_desc:0 "Prussia is, without a doubt, the future european superpower, a country that will rival France's and Britain's long supremacy over the world. If they are the future, then so can we. Taking a look at Prussia is not a bad idea, as after all, even the biggest empires are starting to get worried that they are getting very powerful."
VEN_look_to_france:0 "Look to France"
VEN_look_to_france_desc:0 "The biggest rival and most dangerous and powerful enemy the British Empire has ever faced; France. They have never fallen behind Britain, and even so, have tried expanding to maintain their position in the competition. Taking inspiration from France is taking inspiration from the owners of modernity."

VEN_modern_army_equipment_desc:0 "The British have always made sure to keep their military up to date and always above everyone else. If we don't want to end up as a long-forgotten echo, we have to learn to copy their homework to be able to fend off against our neighbors never-ending imminent threat."

#MISSIONS & DECISIONS
VEN_decision_category_the_caudillos_crisis: "The Caudillos Crisis"
VEN_decision_category_the_caudillos_crisis_desc: "The warlords of Venezuela, colloquially known as the caudillos, originated from the War of Independence and from Venezuela's separation of La Gran Colombia. In the chaos with everyone trying to seize power and deciding who would be the first leader of the nation, several of these caudillos emerged, taking various lands forcefully. \n\nBeing a massive headache to the Venezuelan government, given that they had turned into guerrillas, an agreement was reached. They would be given official and autonomous power over their controlled lands, so long as they'd work under the government, reassuring their authority with their own militias. From that point on, the caudillos are the actual people in power, removing governments if they don't like their decisions. This is because Venezuela has no actual army of its own, since this would have caused massive issues with them. The only thing separating the caudillos between power over the nation and death is their own combatants, mostly incapable and incompetent men who were given a weapon and no training. If the government manages to build an army, these would take out the combatants of the caudillos in no time, leading up to their downfall. As such, there has always been tension between the caudillos and the government, because even if each have their differences, there is a common enemy; the President of Venezuela.\n\nThere is, however, a problem. While attempts were and could be made to remove the government's main headache, the caudillos would act swiftly to end the efforts and remove those in power. Due to all of these things, if we want to stay in power, we need to make sure to remove the caudillos, very carefully, however, because otherwise, the nation will collapse.\n\n§RCurrent Unrest: §Y[?Root.VEN_caudillos_unrest]§!\n§CCurrent Influence: §Y[?Root.VEN_caudillos_influence]§!"
VEN_decision_prohibit_slavery: "Prohibit the Slave Keeping"
VEN_decision_prohibit_slavery_desc: "For too long have slaves been captives of the rich, trapped in the halls of their haciendas, doomed to live forever as unfairly paid servants. This is too inhumane, we can't just stand and turn a blind eye. On the other hand, this could potentially cause much unhappiness among the caudillos and the population."
VEN_decision_restrict_freedom: "Restrict Freedom"
VEN_decision_restrict_freedom_desc: "We need to take the next step to progress as a nation. However, change often causes unhappiness. If we don't start to restrict the freedom of the people now, this might have negative consequences in the future. We should start off with the caudillos."
VEN_decision_promote_national_reconciliation: "Promote National Reconciliation"
VEN_decision_promote_national_reconciliation_desc: "Our country has been plagued with resistance and revolution since its birth. Never has the people been satisfied with the current government, now even less, with tensions arising between the liberals and the conservatives. Spreading propaganda will not automatically fix this, but it might be a start."
VEN_decision_acquaintances_key_positions: "Put Acquaintances in Key Positions"
VEN_decision_acquaintances_key_positions_desc: "In order to ensure that our current government stays in power, trying to put the people we trust will greatly hold our position, and even more than that, caudillos will be more than satisfied, given the more powerful positions. Certainly looks like a win-win."
VEN_decision_allow_return_exiles: "Allow Return of Specific Exiles"
VEN_decision_allow_return_exiles_desc: "While bringing back those blacklisted from the nation could cause issues, it might calm things down. By bringing a very selective group of exiles who we, obviously, know that aren't troublemakers, we can calm the people while not causing problems for ourselves."

#EVENTS
 venezuela.1.t: "The March Revolution"
 venezuela.1.d: "After years since Venezuela was under a huge social, political and economical crisis, the opposition began to heavily oppose the liberal government of Monagas. Julían Castro, the governor of the province of Carabobo and a conservative politician, spoke out against the government and rallied generals José Laurencio and Léon Febres for his cause. After a minor fight, the unstable government was couped in a revolution who took Caracas back to the conservatives. The victorious conservatives have convoked a national assembly in Valencia to stabilize the government and officially establish Julían Castro as the president. Also, deals have been made with Great Britain and France on a protocol to peacefully solve the situation between conservatives and liberals."
 venezuela.1.a: "The liberal government is over."

 venezuela.2.t: "The 1858 Constitution"
 venezuela.2.d: "The national assembly of Valencia has declared a new constitution, rejecting the liberal reforms of the previous one that didn't appeal to their interest and weakened the oligarchy. The conservatives have given more autonomy to the states, reaffirming a federation. With this, the name 'Republic of Venezuela' has been officialized. Some liberals have been pleased with this federation, but others claim it's only temporary."
 venezuela.2.a: "This might ease the tensions.."

 venezuela.3.t: "La Galipanada"
 venezuela.3.d: "A protest against the government of Júlian Castro happened in Caracas and Galipan. A liberal conspiracy against the conservative government began with the diplomatic tensions with Britain and France, as the Urrutia Protocol was not honored and the government is imprisoning and persecuting the opposition. In response, the protest began and was quickly taken down, due to the disorganization of their plans and the lack of support, that lead to them being easily arrested and put down."
 venezuela.3.a: "It seems the tensions only have gotten worse."

 venezuela.4.t: "The Fall of Coro"
 venezuela.4.d: "Commander Tirso Salaverria has betrayed the Venezuelan government and with his troops, invaded the headquarters of the army in Coro, gathering 900 rifles and declaring a Venezuelan Federation, claiming for liberty, equality and the end of the oligarchy. They asked for further decentralization, as Ezequiel Zamora and other exiled generals had arrived to join the revolt, it spread throughout the nation, as liberal forces spread throughout Zulia and seized the local port."
 venezuela.4.a: "This is absurd! We are the legitimate government!"
 venezuela.4.b: "The federation stays free!"

 venezuela.5.t: "Failure in Coplé"
 venezuela.5.d: "The strengh of the central army is weakening us, as our guerrilla tactics are still weak and our army is focused on trying to conquer Caracas. We have been defeated easily by the conservative forces, who are holding us off and slowly waiting to push. Falcon has suggested that we divide our army into many forces to fight a guerrilla warfare and get support from all around the nation, specially in the Miranda region."
 venezuela.5.a: "Resist until the end!"

 venezuela.6.t: "Falcón's troops and guerrillas organize!"
 venezuela.6.d: "After years of fighting and returning in 1861, Falcón was finally able to organize his troops in an enormous push. Since our failure, our strengh is growing more than ever. We have called troops all around Venezuela to try to take Caracas, so we seize the government's main city and achieve victory!"
 venezuela.6.a: "The federation shall win!"

 venezuela.7.t: "The Treaty of Coche"
 venezuela.7.d: "After years of violent conflict, the conservative government has agreed to settle the civil war in a peace treaty. Our forces have captured most of their main cities and ports, leaving them powerless against our influence. Peace has finally been achieved, as the government's army has recognized our government as legitimate and Juan Falcón and Jose Paéz representatives have signed a deal at the city of Coche. They convoked the national assembly, electing 88 new officials and finally instituting the liberal party as the governing one. The government has been united and the civil war has finished, with the federation achieving victory."
 venezuela.7.a: "For liberty!"

 venezuela.8.t: "Jose Tadeo begins a rebellion!"
 venezuela.8.d: "After a harsh discussion about the army, Falcón imprisoned the navy minister Manuel Bruzual. This greatly angered most of the liberals and the conservatives, causing a split in the party, that lead to Monagas creating a committee of rebels, planning to overthrow the government. This is a problem, as they are widespread and our forces have been severely weakened since the civil war!"
 venezuela.8.a: "This is extremely worrying!"

 venezuela.9.t: "The Blue Revolution"
 venezuela.9.a: "The Blue forces, under Tadeos Monagas, have encircled the army in Caracas after numerous small conflicts. Bruzual was unable to defend the capital, Caracas, as it was taken by Monagas, who declared a new administration and government, putting Villegas in power. But the armed forces decided just to elect his son, José Ruperto Monagas, as the new president. The city is now under attack and the government has been couped, long live the revolution!."
 venezuela.9.b: "May Monagas guide us.."

 venezuela.10.t: "The Yellow Revolution"
 venezuela.10.d: "A campaign was started by Antonio Guzmán Blanco, general of Venezuela and other veterans of the federal war to overthrow the conservative-liberal coalition of the Blue government. They began secretly their plan by coming from Curaçao, with the rebel army arriving in the port of Coro. Now, their army has invaded Caracas and were supported by the people, who were very angered at the unstable Monagas government. The same Monagas signed an agreement, surrendering and handing the power to Blanco, as the yellow liberals take control once again of the country."
 venezuela.10.a: "Liberty for us!"

 venezuela.23.t: "The Federal War"
 venezuela.23.d: "Filled with instability, a divide was growing in Venezuela. As the conservative oligarchy grew richer, centralized and authoritarian as they couped the government in 1858 and treated their opposition brutally, not meeting european demands that tried to stabilize the situation. The liberal federalists have been claiming for a social change from the colonial structure and gathered a large support within the generals. As the conservative presidents failed to stabilize the situation, it all came together in small revolts and by the end, Tirso Salaverria proclaimed a new government in Coro and brought a large number of generals to fight, gathering support from troops all around the country, that began to stage guerrilla warfare against the central government. \n\nVenezuela is now in a state of civil war."
 venezuela.23.a: "Liberals and Conservatives will never get along.."
 venezuela.23.b: "Stand united!"
 venezuela.23.c: "Long live the federation!"
