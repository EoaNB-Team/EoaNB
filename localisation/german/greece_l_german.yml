The monarchy and the enlightened absolutism of Otto stands strong in the face of threats and problems and our king while old and sickly will make sure that he does everything he can to ensure Greek prosperity in the time he has left. Opposition is strong and anti monarchist democrats and liberars are a constant pain to deal with and results to us having to divert huge amounts of money to quel such sentiments of distain. It is a mere hope of the King that the people realize his good willed nature and go through the neccesary steps to ensure a strong state that is capable of protecting the interests of greeks far beyond its borders. These feeling of compasion have for a long time not been mutual with the population and it is seen as an attempt to gain absolute power over Greece. Only time will tell the response of Greeks to such actions. "

 GRE_simmering_revolution_desc: "For long enough Greece has sufered in the hands of wicked monarchs that desire welfare for themselves rather than the nation they are supposed to rule.

It stands as the capital of the Peloponnesian state and its population and quality of life shows a regional average status of most of the cities in the penislyla. This visit will serve as a boost to the legitimacy of our rule and provide a distinct feeling of inclusion to the people of Patras to see that the King of the entire Greek nation has decided to visit a place so far away from the urban centrers of Athens or Argos.

Its fertile lands, vital trade routes, and proud history of resistance against foreign rule make it a coveted prize. For many Cretans, union with Greece seems inevitable. The future of Crete hangs in the balance, and its fate could be the key to Greece’s ambitions of expansion."
 GRE_greeks_asia_minor: "The Greeks of Asia Minor"
 GRE_greeks_asia_minor_desc: "Far from the mainland, the Greek communities of Asia Minor have lived for centuries under foreign rule, yet their spirit remains deeply tied to Hellenic identity. By the mid-19th century, as the flames of nationalism spread, these Greeks yearn to unite with their brothers across the Aegean. Driven by the same ideals that ignited the 1821 Revolution, they dream of breaking free from Ottoman control and becoming part of a unified Greek nation. The call for union grows louder, pushing the question of Asia Minor to the forefront of Greece's national agenda.:"
 GRE_thessaly_ours: "Thessaly is ours!"
 GRE_thessaly_ours_desc: "For centuries, the fertile plains of Thessaly have been under the heavy yoke of the Ottoman Empire, with its rich agricultural lands feeding the empire’s coffers. The Greek population in the region remains divided — some seek assimilation into the Ottoman system for survival, while others harbor fierce dreams of liberation. Revolts have come and gone, but the dream of a free Thessaly now have come alive in the hearts of many!"
 GRE_macedonian_resistance: "The Macedonian Resistance"
 GRE_macedonian_resistance_desc: "The hills and mountains of Macedonia have long been a battleground for those who dream of freedom. In the 19th century, as the Ottoman Empire’s grip begins to weaken, the fires of rebellion burn bright across the region. Greek patriots, driven by dreams of independence and inspired by the successful revolutions in Southern Greece, have formed resistance groups to fight Ottoman oppression."
 GRE_ionian_islands: "The Ionian Islands"
 GRE_ionian_islands_desc: "The Ionian Islands, a cluster of beautiful and strategically significant islands in the Ionian Sea, have long been a center of intrigue and conflict. Controlled by various powers over the centuries, they have come under the rule of the British Empire since the early 19th century. While protected from the ravages of Ottoman control, the Greek population of the islands dreams of uniting with their homeland."
 GRE_aegen_sea_dominance: "Aegean Sea Dominance"
 GRE_aegen_sea_dominance_desc: "To secure its place as a rising power, Greece must build a modern and powerful navy capable of challenging Ottoman control in the Aegean. Dominance over these waters would not only protect the Greek mainland and islands but also open trade routes, secure vital resources, and inspire the Greek people in their national struggle against Ottoman oppression. Greece’s finest minds must push the boundaries of naval engineering, crafting vessels that can outmaneuver and outgun the Ottoman armada. The spirit of ancient mariners flows through the veins of every Greek sailor, but will that be enough to stand against the might of the empire?"
 GRE_megali_idea: "The Megali Idea"
 GRE_megali_idea_desc: "In the hearts of the Greek people, the dream of restoring the grandeur of the Byzantine Empire and uniting all Greek-speaking lands has sparked a powerful vision: The Megali Idea. This grand ambition, born in the 19th century, seeks to bring together all territories with Greek populations, from Epirus to Crete, from the Aegean Islands to Asia Minor. More than just a political aspiration, it is a symbol of Greece’s enduring hope to reclaim its ancient glory and unite its people under one nation."

 GRE_academy: "The Academy of Athens"
 GRE_library_athens: "The National Library"
 GRE_library_athens_desc: "Knowledge and books in Greece during the Ottoman era were hard to come by due to Ottoman decadence and information usually spread through word of mouth or through tradition. It is for this reason we need to create a public national library in the center og our capital to make sure no information is being curtailed by the common foe."
 GRE_encourage_art: "Encourage the Arts"

But today is a new age of knowledge and wisdom and we ough to encourage much of our youth with public education andopportunities of studing abroad."
 GRE_language_question: "The Language Question"
 GRE_language_question_desc: "For Years there have been debates about which version of the Greek language should be adopted as the national language of the country as the two most used dialects are the Katharevousa and the Demotiki. While the Demotiki is the simplest of the two being the language of the common people in Greece , Katharevousa is the language of the intelectuals and the state official and has much more similarities to ancient Greek and traces back to Eastern Roman Greek."
 GRE_demoticism: "Demotiki"
 GRE_demoticism_desc: "The supporters of the Dimotiki are mainly those who believe the Katharevousa is way to complicated and that the language of the majority must be adopted by the goverment. Indeed the common foe does not speak in the Katharevousa and it would may be wise to fit our language to that of the people rather tahn the elites."
 GRE_katharevousa: "Katharevousa"
 GRE_katharevousa_desc: "The support for Katharevousa comes from the intelectuals and the romanticism for the old Hellenic language and culture. Many think a shift of the majority to a dialect tied to magnificence and inteligence will be beneficial in the long term intelect og the Greek citizens."

 # Starting Ideas #

 GRE_idea_Bavarocracy: "Bavarocracy"
 GRE_idea_Bavarocracy_desc: "It has been 14 years since the revolution of 1843 and king Otto still remains highly unpopular among the Greek populace. This great unpopularity is the result of multiple factors. Otto believes that he can rule Greece like his father rules Bavaria, failing to understand that Greece isn't Germany and also not a middle European state. He keeps clinging on his absolute powers not knowing that the more he persists the more unpopular he becomes. The last Bavarian troops and officials have left Greece only some years ago as the king thought prudent to be appointing Bavarians to important governmental and army positions leaving at the same time the indigenous people of the land that they alone fought not so long ago for their very right to be able to define their own fates. In turn, the Bavarian state officials ruled Greece on their own way, importing and imposing their own Germanic models of government, law and education without regards to local customs and traditions whatsoever. The result was a legal educational and army system modeled after the German and French ones. All of these misplacements, combined with the fact that the Greek king remains a devout catholic which is a grave insult to his pious eastern orthodox subjects have caused great ferment among the local populace."

 GRE_idea_alternative_staff: "Alternative Staff"

 GRE_idea_Megali_Idea: "Megali Idea"
 GRE_idea_Megali_Idea_desc: "Since its independence The Kingdom of Greece agonized itself with the progress of the Greek people leaving outside its boundaries. It amplified the idea that the current state was just an imperfect construction, foundation for something bigger. The Megali Idea that was degraded by this very concept, created hopes for a completion of  the national vision on condition that the existing borders were greatly enlarged. This very ideology had major implications in the political and economical aspects of the state especially in times of trouble like in the example of Crete and Macedonia later. The Megali Idea creates a strong sense of unity to the Greek people helping them push aside their political differences for the good of the nation and state. However, the king and the at the time Greek governments must understand that in order to fulfill The Megali Idea Greece must first focus on creating a strong economy and a better organized trained and equipped army. Only then will Greece be able to free the unredeemed Greeks leaving outside of her domain."

Only then will Greece be able to free the unredeemed Greeks leaving outside of her domain."
 GRE_idea_1844_Constitution: "The 1844 Constitution"
 GRE_idea_1844_Constitution_desc: "The 1844 Greek constitution was the result of the 3 September 1843 revolution which forced King Otto to concede to the demands of the rebels for the creation of a constitution. It was modeled after the French constitution of 1830 and the Belgian constitution of 1831. It came from the workings of the Third of September of National Assembly of the Hellenes in Athens and it was essentially a contract between the monarch and the nation. Its most important articles, were the establishment of the principle of monarchical sovereignty, as the monarch was the decisive power of the state and defined his rights. The king had the right to exercise legislative power and also the right to ratify laws. It also defined the creation of 2 legislative bodies, a parliament that could have no less than 80 members which were voted by the people on elections and a Senate with 27 members which were appointed directly by the king. So legislative power was to be exercised jointly by the king, the parliament and the senate. The king had the right to appoint and remove the government's ministers who exercised executive power in the name of the king. One of the greatest innovations of the constitution was the voting of the electoral law of 18 March of 1844 which made Greece the first European country to provide male universal suffrage. On the other hand there were 2 main weaknesses. Firstly the fact that the judicial power was not proclaimed independent but it was decided that the judges were to be appointed and dismissed by the king and were exercising their powers in the name of the king. The second and perhaps bigger flaw was the fact that the right to assemble and associate wasn't ratified by the constitution which was creating problems with the establishment of political parties. Although Otto accepted the establishment of the constitution, he showed from the very beginning that he would use every chance he would get to break it by trying to gather as much power as possible in his own hands which in turn caused even greater discontent to his person and made him highly unpopular."
 GRE_idea_Memory_Revolution: "Memories of the Greek Revolution"
 GRE_idea_Memory_Revolution_desc: "36 years ago, the Greek people took up arms and expelled the Ottomans out of the Peloponnese and central Greece, effectively ending 400 years of Ottoman rule. And so out of the Greek revolution of 1821 the Kingdom Of Greece was born. At last the Greeks had a place where they could call home, being able to define their own fate and carve a future of their own. Greece was the first Balkan country to ever win its independence from the Ottoman Empire and the Greek people take great pride in that event."
 GRE_idea_Greek_Guarantors: "The Guarantors of the Greek Independence"
 GRE_idea_Greek_Guarantors_desc: "Although the Greeks fought very hard and bravely for their independence during the Greek war of independence, it ultimately seemed that they might lose the war. But the 3 competing Great Powers, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, France and The Russian Empire having each of them strategic reasons to support Greek independence demanded the immediate end of hostilities between the Ottoman forces and the Greeks. When the Sublime Porte refused to consent to the creation of a Greek State whether autonomous or independent, the united naval fleets of the aforementioned Great Powers stroke a decisive victory against the Turkoageptian fleet in the naval battle of Navarino. And so in the third London Protocol on the 3rd of February 1830, the plenipotentiaries of the Great Powers declared Greece an independent sovereign state under their joint protection."
 GRE_idea_free_enterprise: "Free Enterprise"
 GRE_idea_free_enterprise_desc: "Free Enterprise is needed to allow investors to invest in our land and our economy without having to fear any problems arising. This would allow our economy to grow further."
 GRE_idea_occupation_athens: "The Anglo-French Occupation of Piraeus"
 GRE_idea_occupation_athens_desc: "In 1854 we tried to declare war on the Ottomans in order to exploit the raging war between Russia and the Ottomans to liberate our territories, but the British and French, the allies of the Ottomans, sent troops and occupied the port of Piraeus for three years in order to stop us. This event caused a national embarrassment to our King and to our army."
 GRE_idea_New_Generation_Politicians: "A new Generation of Politicians"
 GRE_idea_New_Generation_Politicians_desc: "Since 1825 and while the Greek war of independence was raging the first political parties of Greece started making their appearance. They were the English, French and Russian parties. They were named after the 3 Great Powers that helped Greece to achieve and guaranteed her independence. Their name insinuated that each of them had certain interests in Greece that they were trying to achieve. Different politicians in Greece along with the local populace naively believed that each of these Great Powers would help them develop and expand Greece both economically and militarily. After Greece achieved independence and as the years passed, the 3 Greek parties started gradually seeing their power decaying, as a new generation of politicians with completely different casts of minds and background started appearing. For this next generation, the revolution belonged to history. They experienced rapid changes because of the so often political changes and the economic and technical development of the times. They believed that constitutionalism couldn't really progress because the king and his court were undermining it and that the old Greek parties were corrupt decadent, with obsolete ideas. The Greek populace had already lost its trust to the old parties, when during the Crimean War a combined Anglo-French fleet blockaded the Greek ports because Greece thought that by entering the war on the side of The Russian Empire they would be able to annex Epirus and Thessaly from the Ottomans. The Greeks realized that in order to expand their borders they must learn to manage on their own."

 GRE_Disorganised_Army: "A Disorganised Army"
 GRE_Disorganised_Army_desc: "Despite fighting ferociously and valiantly in the Greek War of independence, the Greek army was not a modern professional force. It consisted of independent local chieftains that each of them commanded small groups of soldiers. These soldiers weren't professional soldiers, but irregulars called Kleftes or in the best case, Armatoloi which were policemen formerly in the service of the Ottoman Empire that were among the rebels that fought for Greek independence during the 1821 rebellion. The chieftains also hadn't established a clear chain of command between them as all of them wanted to be equals. After the assassination of Kapodistria's in 1831, the army simply ceased to exist and so when King Otto first came to Greece, he brought with him a 4000-strong Bavarian contingent. The royal government re-established the regular army and dissolved the irregular forces as they couldn't be controlled or fit in a modern army. But that particular move was seen as something very unfair by the local populace as these same irregulars were the people that fought during the Greek war of independence. Gradually Greeks started being admitted into the army and during those years the army was reformed many times. But in 1857, it still lacks many important things that the modern armies of the great powers have and is in no way ready for a confrontation with the Ottoman Empire. The kingdom of Greece must first establish and develop a strong economy so it can fund, equip and modernize the army and be ready to pursue the realization of the Megali Idea."
 GRE_idea_Sea_Trade: "The Greek Sea Trade"
 GRE_idea_Sea_Trade_desc: "During the 18th century a great increase in shipping and commercial activity was observed in many seafront regions of Greece. This activity was greatly expanded through a series of favorable events, such as the treaty of Kioutskouk Kainartzi that encouraged many Greek citizens of the Ottoman Empire to become involved in the sea trading business and as a result many became rich. When the Greek war of Independence started, the Greek merchant fleet was easily converted to a battle fleet that helped the revolution succeed but at a great cost, as many ships were ultimately destroyed. Nevertheless and despite these losses, in the years following the end of the revolution, the Greek sea trade was on the rise. In 1840, all the ships of the Greek merchant fleet together had a capacity of 100k tones and the following decade it was further increased. There are of course also fluctuations since the Greek riggers are currently being replaced by new merchant steamships but this will only help Greece in the long run."

 greece.1.t: "The Disappointing Reign of King Otto"
 greece.1.d: "Since the establishment of monarchy in Greece in 1832 under the Convention of London, the Kingdom Of Greece has been ruled by King Otto the second son of Ludwig I of Bavaria. Initially having high hopes for him the Greek populace welcomed the young monarch with open arms hoping that with his wise actions he would guide them to build a strong prosperous and enlarged Greek kingdom. All their hopes were proven fruitless. The young king proved to extremely inexperienced, despotic and an egoist by ruling as an absolute monarch and refusing repeatedly to concede to the creation of a constitution out of fear of losing his power and failing to understand and adopt the customs and practices of the Greek people till the local populace decided that enough was enough. An armed revolution in 3 September 1843 forced Otto to accept the creation of a Greek constitution. Now, 25 years later the situation hasn't improved almost at all. Although Greece now has a constitution and elections are held Otto is still causing instability by appointing weak governments so that he retains his autocratic power and on top of that he remains childless despite the repeated attempts the queen and him made to produce a male heir. And on top of all that Otto managed to repeatedly displease the 3 Great Powers by constantly trying to earn the favor of one of them and by constantly defying their orders especially when it comes to Greek foreign policy. If the situation doesn't improve soon the Greek populace might soon rebel once more and this time Otto might be unable to keep his crown."

He is a young man and very popular to most Greeks, who believe that if the British are friendly to us, the liberation of our territories will be achieved easily. On the other hand, a significant portion of our population wants to see the abolishment of the monarchy and the establishment of a Republic. If we remain a monarchy, we will enjoy the support of the Great Powers, but with the limitations that come with it, if we become a Republic, we will be initially isolated, but a bright future opens up."

Should Prince Albert be allowed to become King of Greece, this would reinforce our standing with the Greeks, but at the same time this will cause great dissatisfaction amongst the other guaranteeing powers of Greece -France and Russia- and will disrupt the fragile balance of powers."

Avoiding the pomp of his predecessor, the whole affair of Alfred's coronation happened quickly and quite humbly. In attendance were the Prime Minister, the Archbishop, most prominent politicians and representatives from the business community. With his coronation, King Albert has to deal with several issues, including stabilizing Greek politics and dealing with the years of mismanagement that have left the Greek economy weak and unproductive. Nevertheless with his extensive influence with the United Kingdom and Germany he is expected to campaign in favour of reclaiming our territories."

 greece.8.t: "Alfred not allowed to become King"
 greece.8.d: "Queen Victoria has rejected the Greek demands that Prince Alfred becomes King of Greece. Her rejection comes from the concerns voiced from France and Russia that the United Kingdom would gain too much power in Greece, and now we have to find a new King. A suitable candidate would be Prins Vilhelm von Glucksburg, the son of the Crown Prince Christian of Denmark and who belongs to a minor dynasty with no major claims or pretentions, and thus an ideal candidate approved by the Great Powers. Prince Vilhelm may not have as close relations to the British as Alfred, but he is a worthy substitute and his family has connections with nearly every European house."

In attendance were the Prime Minister, the Archbishop, most prominent politicians and representatives from the business community.

Trying to prove to his new subjects that he is fit to rule, the coronation was very expensive and impressed many attendants of the competence of the new King. Nevertheless, the majority of the population views the new King with skepticism as he is overshadowed by his predecessors unpopularity and the fact that his conversion to Orthodox Christianity a few days prior to the coronation was viewed very oddly. King Leopold will have to prove the entirety of his new Kingdom that he is a good sovereign and that he will recover the Hellenic lands. In doing so he will have the advantage of close relations with Germany and Austria, as well as with Russia, though that will upset France and the United Kingdom."

As it grew, it became a symbol of our commitment to human dignity, embodying the spirit of solidarity in the face of adversity. The Red Cross was instrumental in fostering the ideals of service and sacrifice, and its presence transformed our ability to respond to crises. By organizing this vital institution, Greece demonstrated a profound sense of responsibility for both its people and those affected by the wider struggles of the era. This legacy of care and compassion still echoes in our national identity today."

 ### GREEK NAVY EVENTS####

 greece.500.t: "The Question of the Navy"
 greece.500.d: "The Greek government stands at a crossroads, facing a pressing and daunting reality: the state of the navy is abysmal. Decades of underfunding and neglect have left the fleet a shadow of its former glory. While the seas once carried the legacy of ancient Hellenic dominance, now the Ottoman Empire's navy continues to project power across the Aegean, and without a powerful Greek fleet, any ambitions of securing the islands or defending the mainland are little more than pipe dreams.\n \n A fierce debate now rages within the halls of power. Some argue that Greece must pour its limited resources into land defenses and diplomacy, believing the navy to be an unmanageable expense. Others, however, see the navy as the very key to the nation’s survival and resurgence. Without control of the seas, Greece remains trapped — unable to trade freely, protect its coastline, or contest Ottoman dominance.\n \n The Question of the Navy must be answered, and soon. Will Greece embark on an ambitious naval program to restore its presence on the waves, even at great cost? Or will the nation's leaders decide to focus their strength elsewhere, risking the seas to remain a domain of foreign powers? The future of Greece may well rest on this decision. The sea has always been Greece's lifeblood. Now, it could become either its shield — or its grave."
 greece.500.a: "Greece will prevail!"
 greece.500.b: "Focus on Small & Efficient ships"
 greece.500.c: "Under the surface we go!"

 greece.501.t: "Mission to send Cadets Abroad"
 greece.501.d: "As the dawn breaks over the horizon, a new chapter unfolds with the mission to send our cadets abroad for naval training. Clad in crisp uniforms, these young men will embark on a journey across turbulent seas to immerse themselves in the rich maritime traditions of foreign navies. This transformative experience will not only sharpen their skills but also forge enduring bonds of camaraderie and international friendship, ensuring that our navy is equipped to navigate the challenges of tomorrow's oceans."
 greece.501.a: "Our journey begins"

 greece.502.t: "Cadets Returned"
 greece.502.d: "Our cadets have finally returned."
 greece.502.a: "I hope it was worth it"

 greece.503.t: "Greek Steamship Athens"
 greece.503.d: "The wooden wheeled steamship Athens, weighing 430 tones and able to carry another 100 tones was made in October of 1837 in the naval port of Poros from admiral G. Tombazi and first named after King Otto. It was used as a transport carrier for the royal family but also as a state's freighter. In 1850, it was confiscated by the english due to the Don Pacifico affair. It was confiscated again with the rest of the Greek fleet from the French, in May 1854 during the Crimean War. Later in 1854, it was assigned to transfer Athens occupants to the islands of Saronikos due to the cholera epidemic in Athens. In 1862, it took part in the Nafplion blockade and in the repression of the Nafplion revolt. Later that year, it was renamed as Athens. It remained in service up to 1864 for transporting military processions in Corfu for the union celebrations of Ionian islands with the rest of Greece."
 greece.503.a: "Interesting."

 greece.504.t: "Greek Corvette Loudovikos"
 greece.504.d: "Loudovikos was a corvette of the Hellenic Navy built in 1838 at the Poros Naval Shipyard, designed by naval architect Georgios Tombazis. It was named after King Ludwig I of Bavaria, the father of King Otto of Greece.It was a relatively large ship (length 44.1 m, 1000-ton displacement), was armed with two 22-lb plus four 20-lb long guns, and twenty-four 32-lb carronades, and had a crew of 182. The ship was not operationally utilized, and since 1846 it was used as a training ship (renamed Messolongion after the ousting of Otto in 1862). It officially remained in service with the Royal Hellenic Navy until 1873."

 greece.600.t: "Construction of the Athens-Piraeus Railway begins"
 greece.600.d: "Today, on [GetDateText] the British Businessman Edward Pickering applied to receive the construction permit to build and operate the railway between Athens and Piraeus. The permit was granted and it is expected that construction will start within the two months. The railway was first proposed in 1835, but the proposal was very ahead of time and was ignored. The issue resurfaced on 1843 under the proposal of Foreign Minister Alexandros Rizas Ragazis, but he was too ignored. It was not until 1855 with the support of Foreign Minister Alexandros Mauvrokordatos that an edict was passed allowing for the construction of the Athens - Piraeus railway, but the political instability would prevent this from happening."
 greece.600.a: "Excellent"

 greece.601.t: "Inauguration of the Athens-Piraeus Railway"
 greece.601.d: "On [GetDateText] the Athens - Piraeus Railway was inaugurated with the attendance of the Queen of Greece, the Prime Minister, several politicians and military officers and foreign dignitaries. This was a brilliant moment and the attendants experienced the whole trip from Athens to Piraeus and back. Most notably the railway was praised as 'a symbol of progress and of civilization'."
 greece.601.a: "What a lovely ride it was"

 greece.602.t: "The Draining of Lake Kopais"
 greece.602.d: "When the lake existed, the towns of Haliartus, Orchomenus, and Chaeronea were on its shores. Rivers feeding the lake included the Cephissus, Termessus and Triton. The lake was (and is) surrounded by fertile land, but the lake increasingly encroached on the surrounding land because of inadequate drainage. In response to this, in 1867–1887 Scots and French engineers reclaimed the land for the British Lake Copais Company, by building channels to drain water from the lake to the Cephissus and from there to Lake Yliki (Ylíki Limní, ancient Hylica). In total about 200 square kilometres (77 sq mi) were reclaimed. This land was returned to the Greek government in 1952. The Kopais Lake Agency was created in 1957 to supervise the draining of the lake and building of a new road."

 greece.603.a: "Excellent"

 greece.604.t: "The Fix Brewery"
 greece.604.d: " In [GetYear], a new chapter in Greek industry began with the founding of the Fix Brewery by Johann Karl Fix in Athens. Initially a small family operation, the brewery was the first of its kind in Greece, marking the introduction of modern beer brewing to the country. Fix quickly became synonymous with Greek beer, providing a refreshing alternative to the imported beverages of the era. Over time, its quality and popularity grew, helping establish Greece's own brewing tradition. \n \n This modest beginning sparked an industrial revolution in Greece’s beverage industry. As demand surged, Fix became more than just a local product — it transformed into a symbol of Greek modernization and entrepreneurship. "
 greece.604.a: "Excellent"

 greece.605.t: "Efforts To Increase Greek Industrial Capacity"
 greece.605.d: " Despite our plight, it is of utmost importance that we continue to develop our sectors of the economy. In this way, we are moving ever closer to the countries of the West. A developed industry means a sovereign Greece, and we must strive with all our might for this!"
 greece.605.a: "We have no time to waste on the industrialization"
 greece.605.b: "Balance time and resources"
 greece.605.c: "First save the nation and then expand the industry"

 greece.606.t: "Newly discovered mines in Greece"
 greece.606.d: "Since the independence, Greece has been a predominantly agricultural country. The first industries established in the 1860s were also linked to agriculture such as wine, paper, cotton. It has been argued that the discovery of the mines was accidental. A Greek sailing ship is said to have used the slag from Lavrion as ballast. During a stay in Sardinia, Mr Serpieri, the owner of the mines on the island, had the idea of analysing them. After discovering their potential, he joined forces with the Marseille entrepreneur Roux to exploit the Laurion deposit. The reopening of the Lorient mines in the 1860s and 1870s coincided with the creation of other mining, metallurgical and chemical enterprises that took the country in a new economic direction. Social life in Lavrio, having been so depended from the industries of the area, naturally followed their course."
 greece.606.a: "Let's hope this helps us with the crisis."

 greece.607.t: "Lavreotika Affair"
 greece.607.d: "In 1864, Serpieri founded the Italian-French company Hilarion Roux & Cie in the port of Ergastiriacchia, Port of Laurio. The company undertook the exploitation of ancient mines and the mining of silver-bearing lead ores. In 1865 it opened a fully equipped plant with 18 furnaces, small ore washing facilities and a railway system. The company continued to expand rapidly. By 1867, it employed 1,200 workers, a record number compared to contemporary employment figures for the entire country. In the spring of 1871, the Franco-Italian Company began to make profits, especially when it began to mine in situ and slag. In the spring of 1871, however, France found itself in a delicate diplomatic situation after its defeat by Prussia. Greece tried to take advantage of this to improve its economic situation."
 greece.607.a: "Nationalize the mines"
 greece.607.b: "Leave the mines to the French for now"

 greece.608.t: "National Assembly of 1872"
 greece.608.d: "The prime minister, Thrasyvulos Zaimis, promised in 1871 that what became the 'Lavreotika affair' was his government's main concern. His successor, Dimitrios Voulgaris, pleaded with France and Italy for patience and forbearance until parliamentary elections could be organised in 1872 and the new session opened. Europe offered its good offices. German scholars failed to provide convincing expert opinions. New samples were sent to Great Britain. The matter began to get lost in the maze of diplomatic relations. Whoever decided in favour of France would, according to Bismarck, be guilty of breaking the isolation imposed. Whoever decided to choose Greece would look like the country's protector, at the risk of upsetting the other candidates for that title. The mine occupation continues. Visiting French and Italian diplomats were insulted and shoved around. France threatened to send its navy and even troops. The new French ambassador, Jules Ferry, passed through Rome. In Piraeus he was more than warmly received. Shortly before his arrival, the Greek government offers to buy the mines from the Roux-Serpieri company."
 greece.608.a: "We need to back down completely"
 greece.608.b: "We shall defend our interests"
 greece.608.c: "Maybe we should think of a different approach"

 greece.610.d: "France has sent their ships in the Aegean. This is an immediate threat for our country's sovereignty. What should we do?"

 greece.611.t: "The Lavrion mines Question"
 greece.611.d: "Greece thinks we're bluffing. Our naval presence in the Aegean didn't convince them about our intentions. They don't actually think we're about to declare war on them. What should we do?"
 greece.611.a: "Let them be for now. They'll pay for this in time..."
 greece.611.b: "Guess what? We weren't bluffing!"

 greece.612.t: "Issue of Achaia Clauss"
 greece.612.d: " In the rolling hills near Patras, something remarkable has taken root: a small winery founded by Gustav Clauss, a Bavarian who, captivated by the fertile vineyards of the region, established the Achaia Clauss winery in [GetYear]. Though modest in scale, the company’s impact on Greece’s winemaking has been nothing short of revolutionary. Clauss’ wines, particularly the now-renowned Mavrodaphne, have begun to reach foreign markets, bringing the taste of Greek craftsmanship to European palates.\n \n The winery’s growth signals a new era of agricultural modernization in Greece. No longer confined to subsistence farming, small ventures like Achaia Clauss are proving that Greece can compete in the international marketplace with products of exceptional quality. As the 19th century progresses, the question of how to best support such enterprises arises: Can Greece leverage the growing reputation of Achaia Clauss to build a robust wine industry? Will the state see the value in nurturing small, innovative businesses to ensure Greece's agricultural future, or leave them to face the pressures of foreign competition alone?"
 greece.612.a: "Every Greek loves wine!"

 greece.613.t: "Issue of Allatini Company"
 greece.613.d: " The Allatini Company, a modest flour mill established in Thessaloniki, may not be an industrial giant, but it holds a key role in Greece's growing economy. Founded by a family of skilled artisans, the company has earned a reputation for producing high-quality flour that supports both local and regional needs. In a time when Greece is striving to modernize and strengthen its agricultural base, the Allatini mill represents the country’s potential for self-sufficiency, even on a small scale.\n \n Despite its size, the company has become a symbol of innovation and efficiency in Greek industry, proving that even small enterprises can contribute to national growth. The question now is how Greece can harness the potential of such businesses. Should the state encourage the expansion of the Allatini model, offering support to small factories that play vital roles in local economies? Or will larger industries continue to dominate, leaving small businesses to fend for themselves?"
 greece.613.a: "Interesting"

 greece.614.t: "Telecomunication Company"
 greece.614.d: " The 19th century has ushered Greece into an era of rapid technological advancement. In [GetYear], Greece's first telegraph line was laid between Piraeus and Syros, heralding the beginning of a new age of communication. The potential to connect Greece with the world through modern telecommunications is undeniable. However, the establishment of a dedicated national telecommunications company now stands as a critical decision. \n \n With foreign investors eyeing control and other powers racing to dominate the region, Greece must decide how to manage this strategic resource. The creation of a national company, tasked with developing and overseeing the country’s telegraph lines and future innovations, could provide both security and progress. Yet, the cost of such an undertaking is significant, and opposition from various corners questions whether a state-led push for modernization is worth the price."
 greece.614.a: "We are living in the 19th century after all"

 greece.615.t: "Land Reform"
 greece.615.d: "The Greek countryside, once hailed as the heart of civilization, now languishes under the weight of inefficiency and outdated practices. Peasants toil on land they do not own, while vast estates controlled by the few hoard the fertile soil of the nation. Agriculture, the backbone of Greece’s economy, is crumbling under the burden of feudalism and inequality. The people cry out for change, and the government can no longer ignore the growing unrest.\n \n The Land Reform question looms over the nation like a storm. Many demand the redistribution of large estates, giving land to those who work it and allowing Greece’s farmers to cultivate crops freely, without the shackles of serfdom. This, they argue, will rejuvenate the nation’s agricultural productivity and lift thousands out of poverty. The fields of Greece are parched for change. Will Greece usher in a new era of prosperity, or will the old ways continue to choke its agricultural potential? "

 greece.619.t: "Compagnie française des mines du Laurion"
 greece.619.d: "In the period from 1875 to 1895, the company constructs the core of its installations. Until 1895, the organized unit includes administrative buildings, mechanical processing installations and hydro- mechanical ore beneficiation, furnaces of thermal ore beneficiation and reducing of lead. The ores extracted from the mines are first beneficiated on the spot. The lead, zinc and mixed sulphide ones, undergo mechanical preparation by the dollies and the ore washing units at Kyprianos. Then the ores are metallurgically processed. There are two distinct procedures; the calamine calcination and the roasting and reducing smelting of lead sulphine. The final product contains 95% lead and is extracted as lead containing silver in sows. The company has been, for a long time, responsible for the town's operation. A great number of houses and shops were belonging to them. They constructed urban infrastructures, such as schools, churches, a small hospital and port facilities, in order to facilitate their operations and attract working population. The Hellenic Company is associated with the use, for the first time in Greece, of electricity, the telephone and other technological innovations. Those included the construction of the Attikos railway, thus connecting Lavrion to Athens. The birth of industry in the area of Lavrio, has caused, on the other hand, a degradation of the environment as a result of the intense mining and metallurgical activity. The natural landscape and the lush forest vegetation have been rapidly deteriorated. The swamps and the coasts were covered with solid wastes; the forests were often burnt down by arson, while smog from the furnaces covered the wider area over many kilometers."

Although the majority of Muslim Cretans are ethnically Greek and also speak Greek, the Christian Greeks view them as Turks nowadays, fueled by strong nationalist tendecies in the Greek mainland, which combine the sense of ethnic affiliation to the nation with religious beliefs.

Recent events would suggest that their treatment would be far from humane, and in a final act of rebellion against the Muslim oppressors, the monastery's abbot ordered the Cretan rebels to blow up barrels of gunpowder, choosing to sacrifice themselves rather than surrender. Following a huge explosion, the monastery went up in flames, and of the almost 1,000 soldiers and civilians within its walls, only a small fraction survived. The incident is likely to cause an international uproar against what the Christian public perceives as Ottoman cruelty against the so-called infidels."

 GREcrete.11.a: "Rejoice!"
 GREcrete.12.t: "The Cretan Revolution Succeeds"
 GREcrete.12.d: "After years of bloody combat, death and devastation on the island, the Ottoman forces on Crete have surrendered and the Ottoman government has had to sent messages to enter peace talks with the rebel leaders. The island will be free from foreign oppression, although it remains uncertain whether Crete will unite with the Greek mainland or whether it will stay an independent state. Given the island's strategic position in the center of the Mediterranean Sea and at the entrance to the Aegean, it will certainly be interesting to see how the great powers react.\n\nHowever, for the Ottoman Empire, not long ago the undisputed hegemon of the region, this surprising defeat seems to indicate that their tumble will continue. The various ethnic groups under Ottoman rule in the Balkans have certainly observed the situation on Crete very carefully, and it is highly likely that they, too, will take up arms to fight for their right of self determination if necessary."

 GREcrete.14.t: "The Cretan Revolution Fails"
 GREcrete.14.d: "The last remaining rebel forces on Crete have surrendered, and the Ottomans have reestablished a firm hold over the island. The Ottoman commanders seem destined to make sure that this was the last uprising of such magnitude there, and the High Porte is said to be actively seeking ways to strengthen their military positions to quell any possible unrest before it can burst. This victory comes at a time of doubt directed towards the strength and stability of the Ottoman Empire, and the world has certainly observed the situation on Crete very carefully, with many foreign ethnic groups under Ottoman rule, especially in the Balkans, seeking for their own path to freedom. For now, their hopes have been shattered. But for how long?"
