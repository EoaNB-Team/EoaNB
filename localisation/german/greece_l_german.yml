 GRE_agrarian_nation_desc: "Agriculture is the backbone of Greece, virtually all revenue is procured through this sector. Greece has olives and grapes in abundance, and of quality not excelled by any other nation. However, Agriculture here is underdeveloped, to say the least. Even in the immediate vicinity of Athens, it is common to find archaic tools such as rude mattocks and wooden ploughs. Fields are ploughed up or scratched over, and crops are replanted season after season until the exhausted soil will bear no more. Fertilizers are not used to any appreciable extent, and the farm implements are of the very rudest description. Furthermore, Greek olives and grapes suffer from faulty transport under conditions that diminish the quality of the goods. To form a strong base for Greece to grow as a nation it is vital that the government tackles the issues at hand."

 # Greek Events #
 ################

 GRE_misc.1.t: "Prime Minister Voulgaris Resigns"
 GRE_misc.1.d: "Today Prime Minister Dimitrios Voulgaris resigned following a fight he had with King Otto. Voulgaris is known to be an intelligent and capable administrator, but also very hot headed and controlling. With his resignation we have but to appoint a new Prime Minister, who will be more loyal to the King than to his own interests. Athanasios Miaoulis, the son of the great naval officer during the revolution Andreas Miaoulis, is considered an ideal candidate, loyal to the Monarchy and popular to the people."
 GRE_misc.1.a: "Miaoulis shall be the new Prime Minister"
 GRE_misc.2.t: "Election Fraud?"
 GRE_misc.2.d: "With the new elections being conducted, we can opt to support the royal faction through election fraud. This would consist of pressuring people to vote for us in the electoral centers and of inflating the numbers in our favour."
 GRE_misc.2.a: "Just a few more votes in favour..."
 GRE_misc.2.b: "No. We should not intervene"
 GRE_misc.3.t: "Newspaper Slams the Monarchy"
 GRE_misc.3.d: "A well known newspaper has today published an article where it condemns King Otto and the Monarchy 'for being responsible for the poor economic and political state of the nation' and advocates 'establishing a republic worthy of our ancestors'. These slanders should not go unpunished, or else it would weaken our side."
 GRE_misc.3.a: "Arrest the journalist"
 GRE_misc.3.b: "No censorship in our nation"
 GRE_misc.4.t: "Public Protests"
 GRE_misc.4.d: "Today, thousands of citizens have organized protests in Athens under the auspices of the Republicans against the current administration and the Monarchy. They demand the Prime Minister to resign, and the King to 'become competent'. Naturally such public signs of dissent can only serve to hurt the monarchy and we should intervene before it is too late."
 GRE_misc.4.a: "Crack down on the protests"
 GRE_misc.4.b: "These are merely minor disturbances"
 GRE_misc.5.t: "Miaoulis Resigns"
 GRE_misc.5.d: "Prime Minister Miaoulis has resigned due to the rising dissent of the people against him and King after the Nauplian Revolution. With Miaoulis' resignation we have but one option, and that is to appoint Ioannis 'Gennaios Kolokotronis', the son of the great hero of the revolutionary war, Theodoros Kolokotronis, like Miaoulis he is very popular with the people and he might help revive the popularity of the monarchy, which over the years has become weaker and weaker."
 GRE_misc.5.a: "Accept the resignation"
 GRE_misc.5.b: "Reject the resignation"
 miaoulis_remove: "Removing §YMiaoulis§! will be §Runpopular§!"
 GRE_misc.6.t: "The Nauplian Revolution"
 GRE_misc.6.d: "Dire news have arrived from the city of Nauplion, in the nomos of Argolis in the Peloponnese, several thousand men have taken the arms and have declared a revolt against King Otto. It seems that the people have grown very much angered with the irresponsible behavior of Otto, and his policies which have resulted in little change in the economic situation of the country since 1833, when Otto first arrived, ironically, in Nauplion. Otto's monarchy began in Nauplion, and it seems it will end from there."
 GRE_misc.6.a: "Suppress the revolt immediately"
 GRE_misc.7.t: "The Skiadika Events"
 GRE_misc.7.d: "The day before yesterday several hundred students went to the Field of Mars wearing 'skiadia', a type of straw hat made in Greece. The protest was an idea of Cleon Ragazis, the son of Alexander Ragazis, the Foreign Minister. The goal was to entice the upper classes to buy Greek hats but it went wrong as the hat importers sent their own agents to make fun of the protesters, resulting in violent actions from both sides and the intervention of the police. The next day they organized a new protest, and demanded the resignation of the head of police and a meeting with Otto. Their demands were denied resulting in the arrests of the students, ending the protests."
 GRE_misc.7.a: "Liberate the students"
 GRE_misc.8.t: "Assassination Attempt on Queen Amalia"
 GRE_misc.8.d: "On September 18th, 1861, while Queen Amalia was riding on her horse near the grounds of the Royal Palace, a young student named Aristidis Dosios tried to kill Queen Amalia. He was unsuccessful because the Queen turned the horse on him and he did not manage to aim properly. The motive for the attempt was to destabilize the regime since Queen Amalia was the regent of Greece, as King Otto was in a foreign trip. The failure of the attempt managed to revive some popularity of the monarchy, though the revival proved short lived."
 GRE_misc.8.a: "Sympathy to the Queen"
 GRE_misc.9.t: "Karelia Tobacco Company"
 GRE_misc.9.d: "Today, [GetDateText] the first generation of the Karelia family established itself as a small tobacco business in Kalamata, Greece. Hopefully their business will thrive through the next years."
 GRE_misc.9.a: "Great!"


 GRE_politics.2.t: "The Abdication of Otto"
 GRE_politics.2.d: "On October 11th the Hellenic Parliament, which was under the control of the revolutionaries, declared Otto's position as King of Greece 'null and void' and declared a new government under Voulgaris, Canaris and Roufos, until the convention of a national assembly to elect a new King. The next day the Royal Yatch 'Amalia' entered Piraeus, and Otto was informed of the news. On that night the Yatch was joined by the British ship 'Scylla' and the French Ship 'Deer' and landed at Salamis. Otto decided then to flee Greece with the ship 'Scylla' to Venice, effectively resigning from the Greek throne, though this was not confirmed officially. Now Greece is free to chose her future."
 GRE_politics.2.a: "An Incompetent King"
 GRE_politics.4.t: "The Death of King Otto I"
 GRE_politics.4.d: "On this day, on the year [GetYear], His Majesty, King Otto I of Greece, of the House von Wittelsbach, has passed away, and he will now rest in peace. His Majesty's Funeral was attended by several thousand loyal citizens, as well as by the Wittelsbachs, yet with his passing there was also much apathy or even anger by a part of the population that still considered His Majesty a failed leader.

 GRE_politics.5.t: "The Referendum of 1862"
 GRE_politics.5.d: "The time has come to conduct the referendum to chose whether we will crown a King or install a Republic. The most popular choice so far for King seems to be Alfred von Saxe-Coburg Gotha, the son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and the heir to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg Gotha. He is a young man and very popular to most Greeks, who believe that if the British are friendly to us, the liberation of our territories will be achieved easily. On the other hand, a significant portion of our population wants to see the abolishment of the monarchy and the establishment of a Republic. If we remain a monarchy, we will enjoy the support of the Great Powers, but with the limitations that come with it, if we become a Republic, we will be initially isolated, but a bright future opens up."

Unsurprisingly there have been electoral irregularities, and even interference from foreign powers, but now all that matters is the result. Whoever wins will be tasked with rebuilding a divided nation."

 GRE_politics.7.d: "Prince Albert von Saxe-Coburg Gotha, the son of Queen Victoria has been reportedly elected King of Greece in a referendum conducted amongst the Greek populace following the abdication of the former King, the Bavarian Otto von Wittelsbach, who was deeply unpopular due to his absolutist practices which ravaged the economy of the nation. Should Prince Albert be allowed to become King of Greece, this would reinforce our standing with the Greeks, but at the same time this will cause great dissatisfaction amongst the other guaranteeing powers of Greece -France and Russia- and will disrupt the fragile balance of powers."

 GRE_politics.8.t: "The coronation of King Alfred I"
 GRE_politics.8.d: "King Alfred I has been crowned King of the Greeks in a private ceremony in the Cathedral of Athens. Avoiding the pomp of his predecessor, the whole affair of Alfred's coronation happened quickly and quite humbly. In attendance were the Prime Minister, the Archbishop, most prominent politicians and representatives from the business community. With his coronation, King Albert has to deal with several issues, including stabilizing Greek politics and dealing with the years of mismanagement that have left the Greek economy weak and unproductive. Nevertheless with his extensive influence with the United Kingdom and Germany he is expected to campaign in favour of reclaiming our territories."
 GRE_politics.8.a: "Long live the new King"
 GRE_politics.9.t: "Alfred not allowed to become King"
 GRE_politics.9.d: "Queen Victoria has rejected the Greek demands that Prince Alfred becomes King of Greece. Her rejection comes from the concerns voiced from France and Russia that the United Kingdom would gain too much power in Greece, and now we have to find a new King. A suitable candidate would be Prins Vilhelm von Glucksburg, the son of the Crown Prince Christian of Denmark and who belongs to a minor dynasty with no major claims or pretentions, and thus an ideal candidate approved by the Great Powers. Prince Vilhelm may not have as close relations to the British as Alfred, but he is a worthy substitute and his family has connections with nearly every European house."

Avoiding the pomp of his precedecessor, the whole affair of George's coronation happened quickly and quite humbly. In attendance were the Prime Minister, the Archbishop, most prominent politicians and representatives from the business community. With his coronation, King Geirge has to deal with several issues, including stabilizing Greek politics and dealing with the years of mismanagement that have left the Greek economy weak and underproductive.

 GRE_politics.11.d: "Prince Luitpold von Wittelsbach, the younger brother of the late King Otto was today crowned King of Greece in a lavish ceremony in the Cathedral of Athens. Trying to prove to his new subjects that he is fit to rule, the coronation was very expensive and impressed many attendants of the competence of the new King. Nevertheless, the majority of the population views the new King with skepticism as he is overshadowed by his predecessors unpopularity and the fact that his conversion to Orthodox Christianity a few days prior to the coronation was viewed very oddly. King Leopold will have to prove the entirety of his new Kingdom that he is a good sovereign and that he will recover the Hellenic lands. In doing so he will have the advantage of close relations with Germany and Austria, as well as with Russia, though that will upset France and the United Kingdom."

The revolutions began with the repressed Nauplian Revolution, but now bigger ones have broken out in Aetolia-Acarnania, where General Theodoros Grivas has declared a full scale rebellion, as well as in parts of the Peloponnese and the Aegean Islands.

 GRE_politics.1.t: "King Otto"
 GRE_politics.1.d: "Since the establishment of monarchy in Greece in 1832 under the Convention of London, the Kingdom Of Greece has been ruled by King Otto the second son of Ludwig I of Bavaria. Initially having high hopes for him the Greek populace welcomed the young monarch with open arms hoping that with his wise actions he would guide them to build a strong prosperous and enlarged Greek kingdom. All their hopes were proven fruitless. The young king proved to extremely inexperienced, despotic and an egoist by ruling as an absolute monarch and refusing repeatedly to concede to the creation of a constitution out of fear of losing his power and failing to understand and adopt the customs and practices of the Greek people till the local populace decided that enough was enough. An armed revolution in 3 September 1843 forced Otto to accept the creation of a Greek constitution. Now, 25 years later the situation hasn't improved almost at all. Although Greece now has a constitution and elections are held Otto is still causing instability by appointing weak governments so that he retains his autocratic power and on top of that he remains childless despite the repeated attempts the queen and him made to produce a male heir. And on top of all that Otto managed to repeatedly displease the 3 Great Powers by constantly trying to earn the favor of one of them and by constantly defying their orders especially when it comes to Greek foreign policy. If the situation doesn't improve soon the Greek populace might soon rebel once more and this time Otto might be unable to keep his crown."

 GRE_Navy_4.d: "The wooden wheeled steamship Athens, weighing 430 tones and able to carry another 100 tones was made in October of 1837 in the naval port of Poros from admiral G. Tombazi and first named after King Otto. It was used as a transport carrier for the royal family but also as a state's freighter. In 1850, it was confiscated by the english due to the Don Pacifico affair. It was confiscated again with the rest of the Greek fleet from the French, in May 1854 during the Crimean War. Later in 1854, it was assigned to transfer Athens occupants to the islands of Saronikos due to the cholera epidemic in Athens. In 1862, it took part in the Nafplion blockade and in the repression of the Nafplion revolt. Later that year, it was renamed as Athens. It remained in service up to 1864 for transporting military processions in Corfu for the union celebrations of Ionian islands with the rest of Greece."

The issue resurfaced on 1843 under the proposal of Foreign Minister Alexandros Rizas Ragazis, but he was too ignored.

The lake was (and is) surrounded by fertile land, but the lake increasingly encroached on the surrounding land because of inadequate drainage. In response to this, in 1867–1887 Scots and French engineers reclaimed the land for the British Lake Copais Company, by building channels to drain water from the lake to the Cephissus and from there to Lake Yliki (Ylíki Limní, ancient Hylica). In total about 200 square kilometres (77 sq mi) were reclaimed. This land was returned to the Greek government in 1952. The Kopais Lake Agency was created in 1957 to supervise the draining of the lake and building of a new road."

 GREeconomy.7.t: "Newly discovered mines in Greece"
 GREeconomy.7.d: "Since the independence, Greece has been a predominantly agricultural country. The first industries established in the 1860s were also linked to agriculture such as wine, paper, cotton. It has been argued that the discovery of the mines was accidental. A Greek sailing ship is said to have used the slag from Lavrion as ballast. During a stay in Sardinia, Mr Serpieri, the owner of the mines on the island, had the idea of analysing them. After discovering their potential, he joined forces with the Marseille entrepreneur Roux to exploit the Laurion deposit. The reopening of the Lorient mines in the 1860s and 1870s coincided with the creation of other mining, metallurgical and chemical enterprises that took the country in a new economic direction. Social life in Lavrio, having been so depended from the industries of the area, naturally followed their course."
 GREeconomy.7.a: "Let's hope this helps us with the crisis."
 GREeconomy.8.t: "Lavreotika Affair"
 GREeconomy.8.d: "In 1864, Serpieri founded the Italian-French company Hilarion Roux & Cie in the port of Ergastiriacchia, Port of Laurio. The company undertook the exploitation of ancient mines and the mining of silver-bearing lead ores. In 1865 it opened a fully equipped plant with 18 furnaces, small ore washing facilities and a railway system. The company continued to expand rapidly. By 1867, it employed 1,200 workers, a record number compared to contemporary employment figures for the entire country. In the spring of 1871, the Franco-Italian Company began to make profits, especially when it began to mine in situ and slag. In the spring of 1871, however, France found itself in a delicate diplomatic situation after its defeat by Prussia. Greece tried to take advantage of this to improve its economic situation."

 GREeconomy.9.d: "The prime minister, Thrasyvulos Zaimis, promised in 1871 that what became the "Lavreotika affair" was his government's main concern. His successor, Dimitrios Voulgaris, pleaded with France and Italy for patience and forbearance until parliamentary elections could be organised in 1872 and the new session opened. Europe offered its good offices. German scholars failed to provide convincing expert opinions. New samples were sent to Great Britain. The matter began to get lost in the maze of diplomatic relations. Whoever decided in favour of France would, according to Bismarck, be guilty of breaking the isolation imposed. Whoever decided to choose Greece would look like the country's protector, at the risk of upsetting the other candidates for that title. The mine occupation continues. Visiting French and Italian diplomats were insulted and shoved around. France threatened to send its navy and even troops. The new French ambassador, Jules Ferry, passed through Rome. In Piraeus he was more than warmly received. Shortly before his arrival, the Greek government offers to buy the mines from the Roux-Serpieri company."

 GREcrete.5.t: "Military Equipment from Greece Arrives"
 GREcrete.5.d: "Military equipment from the mainland has arrived to help the rebels in their struggle for freedom. We surely make use of these weapons to hold the island against Ottoman invasions."
 GREcrete.5.a: "Forward!"
 GREcrete.6.t: "A Volunteer Division from Greece Arrives"
 GREcrete.6.d: "Greece has armed and sent a division of volunteers who are willing to - if necessary - pay the ultimate to fight for Greek freedom on Crete. Their heroic sacrifice will never be forgotten!"
 GREcrete.6.a: "For Greece!"
 GREcrete.7.t: "The Arkadi Explosion"
 GREcrete.7.d: "After holding out against vastly superior Ottoman forces in the local monastery, the walls were eventually about to fall and the attackers were going to capture both soldiers and civilians within the monastery's walls. Recent events would suggest that their treatment would be far from humane, and in a final act of rebellion against the Muslim oppressors, the monastery's abbot ordered the Cretan rebels to blow up barrels of gunpowder, choosing to sacrifice themselves rather than surrender. Following a huge explosion, the monastery went up in flames, and of the almost 1,000 soldiers and civilians within its walls, only a small fraction survived. The incident is likely to cause an international uproar against what the Christian public perceives as Ottoman cruelty against the so-called infidels."
 GREcrete.7.a: "What a terrible tragedy..."
 GREcrete.8.t: "The Arkadi Explosion"
 GREcrete.8.d: "After holding out against vastly superior Ottoman forces in the local monastery, the walls were eventually about to fall and the attackers were going to capture both soldiers and civilians within the monastery's walls.

 GREcrete.8.a: "What a tragedy."
 GREcrete.8.b: "We have to do something to help..."
 GREcrete.9.t: "Greece Joins our Struggle for Freedom"
 GREcrete.9.d: "The Arkadi explosion and the cruelty of the Ottomans invaders led to strong international responses, but none of them really went beyond condemning the action of the Ottoman army on Crete. Now, the motherland has decided to take up arms in our support, and to stand together with us in the fight against Ottoman oppression."
 GREcrete.9.a: "Finally!"
 GREcrete.10.t: "More Volunteers Arrive from Christian Countries"
 GREcrete.10.d: "Following news of the Arkadi explosion, hundreds of volunteers from Christian countries across Europe and the US have since arrived on the island, ready to take up arms against the Ottomans. Many of them even brought their own weapons and other equipment. Their help will certainly be appreciated."
 GREcrete.10.a: "They have our eternal gratitude!"
 GREcrete.11.t: "The Cretan Revolution Succeeds"
 GREcrete.11.d: "Our struggle was not futile and our prayers have been answered - the Ottoman forces and their administration on the island have surrendered and the government in Constantinople has sent messages to enter peace talks. Crete will be free from their oppression!"
 GREcrete.11.a: "Rejoice!"
 GREcrete.12.t: "The Cretan Revolution Succeeds"
 GREcrete.12.d: "After years of bloody combat, death and devastation on the island, the Ottoman forces on Crete have surrendered and the Ottoman government has had to sent messages to enter peace talks with the rebel leaders. The island will be free from foreign oppression, although it remains uncertain whether Crete will unite with the Greek mainland or whether it will stay an independent state. Given the island's strategic position in the center of the Mediterranean Sea and at the entrance to the Aegean, it will certainly be interesting to see how the great powers react.\n\nHowever, for the Ottoman Empire, not long ago the undisputed hegemon of the region, this surprising defeat seems to indicate that their tumble will continue. The various ethnic groups under Ottoman rule in the Balkans have certainly observed the situation on Crete very carefully, and it is highly likely that they, too, will take up arms to fight for their right of self determination if necessary."
 GREcrete.12.a: "The Ottomans are weaker than we thought..."
 GREcrete.12.b: "A heroic struggle!"
 GREcrete.12.c: "A humiliating defeat..."
 GREcrete.13.t: "The Cretan Revolution Fails"
 GREcrete.13.d: "Our forces have finally managed to pacify the island. We will have to make sure that this was the last rebellion against our rule there."
 GREcrete.13.a: "Order has been restored."
 GREcrete.14.t: "The Cretan Revolution Fails"
 GREcrete.14.d: "The last remaining rebel forces on Crete have surrendered, and the Ottomans have reestablished a firm hold over the island. The Ottoman commanders seem destined to make sure that this was the last uprising of such magnitude there, and the High Porte is said to be actively seeking ways to strengthen their military positions to quell any possible unrest before it can burst. This victory comes at a time of doubt directed towards the strength and stability of the Ottoman Empire, and the world has certainly observed the situation on Crete very carefully, with many foreign ethnic groups under Ottoman rule, especially in the Balkans, seeking for their own path to freedom. For now, their hopes have been shattered. But for how long?"
 GREcrete.14.a: "The rebels have fought honorably."
 GREcrete.14.b: "This won't be the last time..."

 # Greek Ideas     #
 ###################

 GRE_idea_Bavarocracy: "Bavarocracy"
 GRE_idea_Bavarocracy_desc: "It has been 14 years since the revolution of 1843 and king Otto still remains highly unpopular among the Greek populace. This great unpopularity is the result of multiple factors. Otto believes that he can rule Greece like his father rules Bavaria, failing to understand that Greece isn't Germany and also not a middle European state. He keeps clinging on his absolute powers not knowing that the more he persists the more unpopular he becomes. The last Bavarian troops and officials have left Greece only some years ago as the king thought prudent to be appointing Bavarians to important governmental and army positions leaving at the same time the indigenous people of the land that they alone fought not so long ago for their very right to be able to define their own fates. In turn, the Bavarian state officials ruled Greece on their own way, importing and imposing their own Germanic models of government, law and education without regards to local customs and traditions whatsoever. The result was a legal educational and army system modeled after the German and French ones. All of these misplacements, combined with the fact that the Greek king remains a devout catholic which is a grave insult to his pious eastern orthodox subjects have caused great ferment among the local populace."
 GRE_idea_Megali_Idea: "Megali Idea"
 GRE_idea_Megali_Idea_desc: "Since its independence The Kingdom of Greece agonized itself with the progress of the Greek people leaving outside its boundaries. It amplified the idea that the current state was just an imperfect construction, foundation for something bigger. The Megali Idea that was degraded by this very concept, created hopes for a completion of  the national vision on condition that the existing borders were greatly enlarged. This very ideology had major implications in the political and economical aspects of the state especially in times of trouble like in the example of Crete and Macedonia later. The Megali Idea creates a strong sense of unity to the Greek people helping them push aside their political differences for the good of the nation and state. However, the king and the at the time Greek governments must understand that in order to fulfill The Megali Idea Greece must first focus on creating a strong economy and a better organized trained and equipped army. Only then will Greece be able to free the unredeemed Greeks leaving outside of her domain."
 GRE_idea_1844_Constitution: "The 1844 Constitution"
 GRE_idea_1844_Constitution_desc: "The 1844 Greek constitution was the result of the 3 September 1843 revolution which forced King Otto to concede to the demands of the rebels for the creation of a constitution. It was modeled after the French constitution of 1830 and the Belgian constitution of 1831. It came from the workings of the Third of September of National Assembly of the Hellenes in Athens and it was essentially a contract between the monarch and the nation. Its most important articles, were the establishment of the principle of monarchical sovereignty, as the monarch was the decisive power of the state and defined his rights. The king had the right to exercise legislative power and also the right to ratify laws. It also defined the creation of 2 legislative bodies, a parliament that could have no less than 80 members which were voted by the people on elections and a Senate with 27 members which were appointed directly by the king. So legislative power was to be exercised jointly by the king, the parliament and the senate. The king had the right to appoint and remove the government's ministers who exercised executive power in the name of the king. One of the greatest innovations of the constitution was the voting of the electoral law of 18 March of 1844 which made Greece the first European country to provide male universal suffrage. On the other hand there were 2 main weaknesses. Firstly the fact that the judicial power was not proclaimed independent but it was decided that the judges were to be appointed and dismissed by the king and were exercising their powers in the name of the king. The second and perhaps bigger flaw was the fact that the right to assemble and associate wasn't ratified by the constitution which was creating problems with the establishment of political parties. Although Otto accepted the establishment of the constitution, he showed from the very beginning that he would use every chance he would get to break it by trying to gather as much power as possible in his own hands which in turn caused even greater discontent to his person and made him highly unpopular."
 GRE_idea_Memory_Revolution: "Memories of the Greek Revolution"
 GRE_idea_Memory_Revolution_desc: "36 years ago, the Greek people took up arms and expelled the Ottomans out of the Peloponnese and central Greece, effectively ending 400 years of Ottoman rule. And so out of the Greek revolution of 1821 the Kingdom Of Greece was born. At last the Greeks had a place where they could call home, being able to define their own fate and carve a future of their own. Greece was the first Balkan country to ever win its independence from the Ottoman Empire and the Greek people take great pride in that event."
 GRE_idea_Greek_Guarantors: "The Guarantors of the Greek Independence"
 GRE_idea_Greek_Guarantors_desc: "Although the Greeks fought very hard and bravely for their independence during the Greek war of independence, it ultimately seemed that they might lose the war. But the 3 competing Great Powers, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, France and The Russian Empire having each of them strategic reasons to support Greek independence demanded the immediate end of hostilities between the Ottoman forces and the Greeks. When the Sublime Porte refused to consent to the creation of a Greek State whether autonomous or independent, the united naval fleets of the aforementioned Great Powers stroke a decisive victory against the Turkoageptian fleet in the naval battle of Navarino. And so in the third London Protocol on the 3rd of February 1830, the plenipotentiaries of the Great Powers declared Greece an independent sovereign state under their joint protection."
 GRE_idea_free_enterprise: "Free Enterprise"
 GRE_idea_free_enterprise_desc: "Free Enterprise is needed to allow investors to invest in our land and our economy without having to fear any problems arising. This would allow our economy to grow further."
 GRE_idea_occupation_athens: "The Anglo-French Occupation of Athens"
 GRE_idea_occupation_athens_desc: "In 1854 we tried to declare war on the Ottomans in order to exploit the raging war between Russia and the Ottomans to liberate our territories, but the British and French, the allies of the Ottomans, sent troops and occupied Athens and Piraeus for three years in order to stop us. This event caused a national embarrassment to our King and to our army."
 GRE_idea_New_Generation_Politicians: "A new Generation of Politicians"
 GRE_idea_New_Generation_Politicians_desc: "Since 1825 and while the Greek war of independence was raging the first political parties of Greece started making their appearance. They were the English, French and Russian parties. They were named after the 3 Great Powers that helped Greece to achieve and guaranteed her independence. Their name insinuated that each of them had certain interests in Greece that they were trying to achieve. Different politicians in Greece along with the local populace naively believed that each of these Great Powers would help them develop and expand Greece both economically and militarily. After Greece achieved independence and as the years passed, the 3 Greek parties started gradually seeing their power decaying, as a new generation of politicians with completely different casts of minds and background started appearing. For this next generation, the revolution belonged to history. They experienced rapid changes because of the so often political changes and the economic and technical development of the times. They believed that constitutionalism couldn't really progress because the king and his court were undermining it and that the old Greek parties were corrupt decadent, with obsolete ideas. The Greek populace had already lost its trust to the old parties, when during the Crimean War a combined Anglo-French fleet blockaded the Greek ports because Greece thought that by entering the war on the side of The Russian Empire they would be able to annex Epirus and Thessaly from the Ottomans. The Greeks realized that in order to expand their borders they must learn to manage on their own."
 GRE_Disorganised_Army: "A Disorganised Army"
 GRE_Disorganised_Army_desc: "Despite fighting ferociously and valiantly in the Greek War of independence, the Greek army was not a modern professional force. It consisted of independent local chieftains that each of them commanded small groups of soldiers. These soldiers weren't professional soldiers, but irregulars called Kleftes or in the best case, Armatoloi which were policemen formerly in the service of the Ottoman Empire that were among the rebels that fought for Greek independence during the 1821 rebellion. The chieftains also hadn't established a clear chain of command between them as all of them wanted to be equals. After the assassination of Kapodistria's in 1831, the army simply ceased to exist and so when King Otto first came to Greece, he brought with him a 4000-strong Bavarian contingent. The royal government re-established the regular army and dissolved the irregular forces as they couldn't be controlled or fit in a modern army. But that particular move was seen as something very unfair by the local populace as these same irregulars were the people that fought during the Greek war of independence. Gradually Greeks started being admitted into the army and during those years the army was reformed many times. But in 1857, it still lacks many important things that the modern armies of the great powers have and is in no way ready for a confrontation with the Ottoman Empire. The kingdom of Greece must first establish and develop a strong economy so it can fund, equip and modernize the army and be ready to pursue the realization of the Megali Idea."
 GRE_idea_Sea_Trade: "The Greek Sea Trade"
 GRE_idea_Sea_Trade_desc: "During the 18th century a great increase in shipping and commercial activity was observed in many seafront regions of Greece. This activity was greatly expanded through a series of favorable events, such as the treaty of Kioutskouk Kainartzi that encouraged many Greek citizens of the Ottoman Empire to become involved in the sea trading business and as a result many became rich. When the Greek war of Independence started, the Greek merchant fleet was easily converted to a battle fleet that helped the revolution succeed but at a great cost, as many ships were ultimately destroyed. Nevertheless and despite these losses, in the years following the end of the revolution, the Greek sea trade was on the rise. In 1840, all the ships of the Greek merchant fleet together had a capacity of 100k tones and the following decade it was further increased. There are of course also fluctuations since the Greek riggers are currently being replaced by new merchant steamships but this will only help Greece in the long run."
