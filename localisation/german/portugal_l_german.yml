 POR_focus_lisbon_madrid_connection_desc: " Even though this is a complicated project on a technical level, given the terrain in question and the need to adopt our Spanish neighbours' railway gauge (which differs from the European standard gauge), it is undoubtedly of paramount importance if we are to mitigate our geographic isolation from the rest of Europe and open up new markets from our exports."

 POR_focus_ban_morgardios: "Ban Morgardios"
 POR_focus_ban_morgardios_desc: "Originating in Castilian legislation and formalized into Portuguese law with the Filipine Ordinances of 1603, the 'morgadio' is an institution dictating the rules of land property management and inheritance. Intended to counter the economic degradation of a family's main branch by repeated inheritances, it granted several privileges to the 'morgado', the land holder, and caused the effective impoverishment of non-firstborn children. It is imperative that we put an end to this archaic institution."
 POR_focus_land_confiscation: "Land Confiscation"
 POR_focus_land_confiscation_desc: "Many fertile lands lie abandoned by their noble landholders, who accumulated them over time through strategic marriage alliances and now find themselves unable or unwilling to properly manage their vast properties.

 POR_focus_expand_vineyards: "Expand Vineyards"
 POR_focus_expand_vineyards_desc: "Port wine and other prestigious vintages are renowned internationally, and count among the few world-class products that our European lands currently export.

The efforts we make to the expand of our vineyards are sure to yield very profitable returns."
 POR_focus_expand_pork_production: "Expand Pork Production"
 POR_focus_expand_pork_production_desc: "There is a silver lining to the vast tracts of currently unused land: the widespread availability of land for animal grazing. Pork, in particular, already a popular staple in Portuguese traditional gastronomy, is very likely to be a successful bet both on the internal market and abroad."
