The shooter, Henry James O'Farrelan irishman, alcoholic and previously released from a mental asylum, shot him in the back with a revolver. The assassin was immediately tackled by William Val, a local coach-maker. The crowd was so outraged that Henry was severely beaten and nearly lynched by the mob before police arrested him. The state of Prince Alfred is currently unknown."
