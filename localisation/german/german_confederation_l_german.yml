gerconfed.101.d: "Austria has recently proposed the \"Frankfurter Reformakte\" to the members of the German Confederation. Those reforms will strengthen their nation by means of some laws and will also move the German Confederation towards being a state of nations. The question now is: Will we support this reform? It would probably be taxing for our country..."

gerconfed.105.d: "The member states of the German Confederation have voted and it looks like a tie! The votes for and against the proposal are exactly the same number, so the issue just ended up being dismissed from the courts..."

#GERMAN CONFEDERATION DEFENCE EVENTS
gerconfed.451.t: "War in Germany"
gerconfed.451.d: "Aside from being a political entity, the German Confederation's main function is to protect each and every member from outside forces. With direct confrontation between the German Confederation and an outside force now being inevitable, the Confederation readies its troops.\nA new wind is blowing throughout the German lands. While the topic of German unification and brotherhood has been brought up by various intellectuals in the past, the people have gained a new perspective: united against an enemy, side by side and shoulder to shoulder, the old order in Central Europe may soon experience change, provided this spirit of unity survives this deadly war."
gerconfed.451.a: "Einigkeit!"
gerconfed.451.b: "An interesting development for sure."
gerconfed.451.c: "Dreams and fantasies won't save them."

#FLAVOUR EVENTS
gerconfed.501.t: "50th Anniversary Ceremony of the Battle of the Nations at Leipzig"
gerconfed.501.d: "It's been 50 years since the combined armies of Russia, Sweden and many German countries handed Napoléon Bonaparte a decisive defeat south of Leipzig, in a battle that was the largest Europe has ever seen. Not only was the so-called 'Battle of the Nations' a major milestone in Napoléon's demise, it also fueled hopes of a German nation state and, for the first time, made this distant dream seem like a real possibility."
gerconfed.501.a: "Let's commemorate and remember the fallen soldiers."
gerconfed.502.t: "Centenary of Friedrich Schiller's Birthday"
gerconfed.502.d: "Today marks the Centenary of Friedrich Schiller's birthday, the famous and influential German poet, playwright, and philosopher born in 1759. He was a vital member of both the 'Sturm und Drang' and the 'Weimar Classicism' literary movements and author of many divine works of art such as the dramas 'Die Räuber' ('The Robbers'), 'Don Karlos' ('Don Carlos'), 'Wallenstein', 'Mary Stuart', or 'Wilhelm Tell' ('William Tell'), and his most famous work of all times, the ode 'An die Freude' ('Ode to Joy') that was later used in Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony many years after Schiller's death, which further underlines his status and importance in German and international literature and culture. Celebrations will be held in a great number of German cities, the largest festivities are expected to take place in Frankfurt and of course Weimar, Schiller's main place of activity."
gerconfed.502.a: "A great literate for sure."
gerconfed.503.t: "Richard Wagner Granted Partial Amnesty"
gerconfed.503.d: "Today, Richard Wagner, a German composer, theatre director, and conductor was granted partial amnesty by His Majesty King Johann of Saxony. After his participation in the failed May Uprising in Dresden, Wagner had been exiled to Switzerland in 1849, where he kept composing music and contacted his good friend Franz Liszt to stage the 'Lohengrin' (a Romantic opera in three acts completed before the Dresden Uprising) in his absence. During his exile, Wagner also wrote 'Das Judenthum in der Musik', a pamphlet that featured his blazing antisemitic views, often criticizing Jewish composers like Felix Mendelssohn."
gerconfed.503.a: "Hm, what will Wagner do now?"
gerconfed.504.t: "Richard Wagner Granted Full Amnesty"
gerconfed.504.d: "A few days ago, the political ban that had been placed on Richard Wagner has finally been lifted and full amnesty has been granted by His Majesty King Johann of Saxony. Wagner is now a free man and able to travel at his own volition, though he still faces economic challenges and is heavily dependent on his patrons. Will Wagner be able to resurge to relevancy once again?"
gerconfed.504.a: "Only time will tell."
gerconfed.505.t: "King Ludwig II of Bavaria Becomes Wagner's Patron"
gerconfed.505.d: "The recently crowned King Ludwig II of Bavaria recently became Richard Wagner's main patron. When he ascended to the throne, he expressed interest in Wagner's operas and eventually brought the composer to Munich, Bavaria's capitol. The King is rumored to have homosexual tendencies, and, thus, it is being said that he was not only interested in Wagner's talent but also had an ardent passion for him out of personal adoration. King Ludwig is now expected to settle Wagner's debts, and he is offering a stage for the operas Wagner has already written and still in mind. What will this mean for Wagner's career?"
gerconfed.505.a: "We shall wait and see."
gerconfed.506.t: "World Premiere of 'Tristan und Isolde' in Munich"
gerconfed.506.d: "As promised by His Majesty King Ludwig II of Bavaria, 'Tristan und Isolde', a complicated opera composed by Richard Wagner, considered by many to be almost impossible to sing and unperformable, yesterday premiered at the National Theatre Munich. Almost 15 years after Wagner's last opera premiere, the event went as planned and the impossible was accomplished, leaving the audience in awe. Though the person who played Tristan, Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld is not feeling very well after the performance, but that might just be a stomachache or something like that and the actor should soon be able to perform again."
gerconfed.506.a: "Wagner's career has been revived."
gerconfed.507.t: "World Premiere of 'Das Rheingold' in Munich"
gerconfed.507.d: "Yesterday, 'Das Rheingold' premiered in Munich, though it was surrounded by controversy. Richard Wagner, the composer of the music drama, didn't want 'Das Rheingold' to premiere at this point, because he wanted to finish the other parts of his four-part cycle of epic music dramas called 'Der Ring des Nibelungen', or the Ring Cycle, first, of which only 'Das Rheingold' is ready to be staged yet. Although there was another reason for Wagner's refusal, as he is purported to have an affair with Cosima von Bülow, a married woman and daughter of Wagner's dear friend Franz Liszt, which led to scandal. Nevertheless, His Majesty King Ludwig II of Bavaria is in possession of the copyright of the work and decided to hold the premiere this year, although Wagner had persuaded the conductor Hans Richter to step down earlier. The angered King Ludwig denounced Wagner and sacked Richter, appointing another conductor, Franz Wüllner, to conduct the piece for the premiere. This matter greatly damaged the relationship of King Ludwig II and Wagner."
gerconfed.507.a: "This might have consequences..."
gerconfed.508.t: "World Premiere of 'Die Walküre' in Munich"
gerconfed.508.d: "Just like 'Das Rheingold' last year, 'Die Walküre' also premiered in Munich yesterday against Wagner's will. The composer is opposed to the premiering because his Ring Cycle is not yet complete and Wagner still holds the opinion that it is an atrocity to premiere them separately. This is almost certain to sour the already damaged relationship between King Ludwig and Wagner further."
gerconfed.508.a: "Oh dear..."
gerconfed.508.b: "Oh dear..."
gerconfed.509.t: "Richard Wagner Married Cosima Liszt in Lucerne"
gerconfed.509.d: "News reaches us of the marriage of Cosima Liszt, former von Bülow, (daughter of Franz Liszt) and Richard Wagner in Lucerne, Switzerland, and the corresponding celebrations. The marriage had been planned for a long time, and the newlyweds had already been in a secret and then open relationship before the death of Wagner's first wife in 1866. Cosima was, at the time, also married, to Hans von Bülow, a friend of Wagner, but the couple finally separated in 1868 and von Bülow granted Cosima a divorce earlier this year, as she already has three children with Wagner now. This is expected to further strengthen the bond between Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt as well."
gerconfed.509.a: "Congratulations!"
gerconfed.509.b: "Congratulations!"
gerconfed.510.t: "Cornerstone Ceremony of the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth"
gerconfed.510.d: "After moving to Bayreuth in 1871, in search for a place willing to build a new opera house, the local town council donated Richard Wagner a large plot of land for that purpose. Earlier this year, the initial foundations for the so-called Festspielhaus, or Festival Theatre, have been laid in Bayreuth. At the cornerstone ceremony earlier today Wagner announced that the building is supposed to be completed by 1873. The venue will feature a so-called 'mystic gulf', a pit between the audience and the stage where the orchestra will be located, meant to provide a unique character to the performances and a physical reinforcement of the mythic character of many of Wagner's operas."
gerconfed.510.a: "Wagner's future looks bright as day..."
gerconfed.511.t: "World Premiere of the Bayreuther Festspiele"
gerconfed.511.d: "Yesterday evening, the first Bayreuther Festspiele, or Bayreuth Festival, commenced in Wagner's Festspielhaus at Bayreuth. The venue was supposed to be completed by 1873, but King Ludwig II of Bavaria refused to finance the project further, and to sustain his dream, Wagner had to raise funds through the so-called 'Wagner societies', which took some time to accumulate a part of the required funding, and in early 1874, King Ludwig agreed to provide Wagner with a loan for the project, and the theatre was finished in 1875, in time for the first edition of the Festspiele this year. The festival was opened with a performance of Beethoven's 'Choral' Symphony yesterday, and today the world premiere of the complete Ring Cycle, along with those of its third and fourth parts 'Siegfried' and 'Götterdämmerung' in the coming days. Although the event's success is yet to be seen, the festival will definitely cement Wagner's standing as an important artist of elevated importance on a global scale, as many important people are set to attend the premiere festival, among them Kaiser Wilhelm I, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, Anton Bruckner, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard Grieg, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky."
gerconfed.511.a: "What will the future hold for Wagner and Bayreuth?"
gerconfed.512.t: "Second Edition of the Bayreuther Festspiele"
gerconfed.512.d: "The premiere of the Bayreuth Festival ended in a financial loss for Wagner, but his standing as an artist improved drastically. In the aftermath, Wagner began working on his opera 'Parsifal'. The composition alone took him four years, most of which Wagner spent in Italy because of his declining health. At first he was having a hard time financing 'Parsifal', but he was assisted again by King Ludwig, but his personal financial situation still forced him to sell the rights to some of his unpublished works. Yesterday, after another ordeal to secure the financing, the second edition of the Bayreuth Festival commenced with the world premiere of 'Parsifal', which was greatly acclaimed by the public. This time, Wagner even held the conductor's baton in his own hands and led the performance to the end, the first time he ever did that at Bayreuth. Worrying, however, is Wagner's health. The renowned composer is severely ill and may not be able to host another festival himself."
gerconfed.512.a: "We can only hope for the best..."
gerconfed.513.t: "Richard Wagner Dies in Venice"
gerconfed.513.d: "Wilhelm Richard Wagner, aged 69, died of a heart attack while on a journey with his family in Venice yesterday.\n He is survived by his wife Cosima Wagner and his children: Isolde Josefa Ludovika, Eva Maria Chamberlain, and Siegfried Helferich Richard Wagner. Today, a funerary gondola will guide his body through Venice, after which his body is going to be taken back to Germany where he will be put to rest in the garden of the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth, with the funeral scheduled for the 18th of February."
gerconfed.513.a: "Good heavens!"
gerconfed.514.t: "Richard Wagner's Funeral in Bayreuth"
gerconfed.514.d: "Following his tragic death in Venice, Richard Wagner's body has been taken back to Germany, accompanied by honorary acts of condolence along the way to Bayreuth via Munich. His funeral is scheduled for today, when his body will be put to rest in the garden of his home in Bayreuth, the Villa Wahnfried, close to the grave of his beloved dog Russ. The German and global art scene has lost one its greatest artistic masterminds, but his legacy is going to live on in Bayreuth and beyond surely."
gerconfed.514.a: "Rest in Peace."
gerconfed.515.t: "HAPAG Steamer Austria Sinks - Hundreds of Casualties"
gerconfed.515.d: "In der Hauptstadt trifft soeben die Nachricht ein, dass der Dampfer SS Austria, ein Handelsschiff der berühmten Hamburg-Amerikanischen Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft (HAPAG), gestern kurz nach Mittag nach einem Unfall an Bord gesunken ist. Unter dem Kapitän F.A. Heydtmann befand sich das Schiff von Hamburg aus auf seiner dritten Reise nach New York City. Berichten zufolge fing das Deck des Schiffes nach einem Unfall während der routinemäßigen Desinfektion durch Ausräucherung des Schiffes vor dem Einlaufen in die Hoheitsgewässer der Vereinigten Staaten Feuer. Durch die rasche Ausbreitung des Feuers, das durch starke Winde angefacht wurde, erstickte die Maschinenbesatzung und das Schiff wurde unkontrollierbar. Als der Steuermann das Steuer verließ, drehte sich das Schiff in den Wind und die Flammen breiteten sich über die gesamte Länge des Schiffes aus, während die Passagiere ins Meer sprangen. Vorbeifahrende französische und norwegische Barken retteten in den Stunden nach dem Unglück einige der Passagiere, aber es wird geschätzt, dass über 400 der 542 Passagiere und Besatzungsmitglieder des Schiffes ihr Leben verloren."
gerconfed.515.a: "Good heavens!"
gerconfed.516.t: "Foundation of the 'Deutsche Volkspartei' (DVP)"
gerconfed.516.d: "Bismarck's question for indemnity, in this case meaning the subsequent legitimization of a previously enforced political action, has divided the liberal movement in Northern Germany, and we, too, can feel the ramifications of this political earthquake. The social liberal movements in the south gathered in Stuttgart a few days ago to coordinate their response, and a vast majority of delegates have voted to form a new party, the so-called 'German People's Party', or 'Deutsche Volkspartei' (DVP), and oppose Bismarck's course towards German unification under Prussian overlordship."
gerconfed.516.a: "Finally a liberal party promoting the greater German solution..."
gerconfed.517.t: "Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik (BASF) Founded by Friedrich Engelhorn"
gerconfed.517.d_bad: "Capitalist Friedrich Engelhorn from Mannheim has established a new chemical and dye company called “Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik” (BASF), or Baden Aniline and Soda Factory. As owner of the local gas lighting company, Engelhorn intends to use coal tar, a waste by-product from the creation of illuminating gas for streets lights, as tar dye (also known as aniline dye), a synthetic dye that is as beautiful as natural dyes but cheaper to produce and less prone to stain when exposed to light. Engelhorn is expected to start construction of the new plant very soon on his premises in Mannheim, but the locals are worried about the pollution and stench that might result from the new plant."

The process has the potential to make the production of textiles and other goods depending on dyes in Germany much cheaper. Engelhorn is expected to start construction of the new plant very soon on his premises in Mannheim, but the locals are worried about the pollution and stench that might result from the new plant. We could use these concerns to our advantage and offer Engelhorn subsidies, if he were to move his company to Ludwigshafen just across the Rhine - but on our territory. Do we want to get involved?"

gerconfed.517.e: "Sounds like a business with good prospects."
gerconfed.518.t: "Bavaria Lures Engelhorn with Industrial Subsidies"
gerconfed.518.d: "News reaches us that the Bavarians have offered Friedrich Engelhorn subsidies to move his company over the Rhine to Ludwigshafen, and, thus, out of our country. They must have gotten wind of the concerns among the Mannheim locals and the city council regarding the factory's potentially unpleasant and hazardous emissions. If we don't match the Bavarians' offer for subsidies, we risk losing Engelhorn and his company..."

There's not much that we can do about it."
gerconfed.519.a: "Good luck to him anyway."
gerconfed.520.t: "Engelhorn and the BASF Move to Ludwigshafen"
gerconfed.520.d_bav: "Our plan to attract Friedrich Engelhorn and his company, the BASF, to Ludwigshafen has been successful. The businessman agreed to our subsidy plan which earmarks 1.5 million guldens to assist with the establishment and growth of the company, and we dearly hope that our investment will be worthwhile. For now, it looks like a certain success."
gerconfed.520.d_gec: "In a surprising turn of events, Friedrich Engelhorn chose the opposite side of the Rhine to establish his chemical production plant. Instead of his hometown of Mannheim in the [BAD.GetName], he opted to construct the new factory in the city of Ludwigshafen, [BAV.GetName], probably attracted by the promise of subsidies provided by King Maximilian II for the promotion of industrial companies in Bavaria. BASF is expected to receive 1.5 million guldens from the Bavarian government; money that can be used in generating further growth and driving innovation for the company. But at least the citizens of Mannheim can rest easy with their fresh and undisturbed air."

gerconfed.521.d: "Die gewaltsame Eskalation des italienischen Einigungskampfes hat Schockwellen über den Kontinent gesandt. Vor allem im zersplitterten Deutschland fielen die Ideale des Nationalstaates auf sehr fruchtbaren Boden. Unmittelbar nach dem Österreichisch-Sardischen Krieg wurde eine Organisation der Hauptbefürworter einer vereinten deutschen Nation gegründet - der Deutsche Nationalverein. Der von Liberalen und gemäßigten Demokraten gegründete Verein unterstützt einen preußisch-geführten deutschen Nationalstaat ohne Österreich. In ihrer sogenannten Zweiten Eisenacher Erklärung haben sich die einflussreichen Clubmitglieder für die deutsche Wiedervereinigung ausgesprochen - und sie setzen ihre Hoffnung auf das [PRS.GetName], da es ihrer Meinung nach der einzige Staat ist, der motiviert genug und in der Lage ist, dieses Kunststück zu vollbringen."

gerconfed.551.d: "Seit einigen Jahren gibt es im [BAD.GetName] eine Auseinandersetzung zwischen den staatlichen Repräsentanten, in erster Linie Seiner Königlichen Majestät dem Großherzog und dessen verantwortlicher Regierung, und der katholischen Kirche. Es geht dabei um Fragen von Einfluss und Macht. Als aufgeklärter, protestantischer Herrscher sieht es der Großherzog als sein Recht an, nicht zuletzt im Sinne der Staatsräson, Einfluss auf die Einsetzung auch der katholischen Amtsträger in seinem Land zu nehmen.\n\nDie katholische Kirche verweigert sich unter dem neuen Erzbischof von Freiburg, Hermann von Vicari, in zunehmendem Maße gegen diese Bevormundung. Vicari pocht auf das göttliche Vorrecht zur Investitur der katholischen Amtsträger und die Unabhängigkeit der Kirche von staatlichen Institutionen. Die Auseinandersetzung erregt landesweite Aufmerksamkeit. Eine gütliche Einigung in diesem Konflikt ist nun an der Weigerung des Vatikans gescheitert, auf das badische Angebot einzugehen."

THU_idea_bastion_of_particularism_desc: "In mid-19th century, Thuringia is not yet a unified state but consists of eight separate independent countries with their own governments and royal families, as well as Prussian and Hessian exclaves. The region remains a peculiar remnant of the particularism characteristic for the Holy Roman Empire. Divided between the Ernestine cadet branches of the Saxon House of Wettin and two other dynasties, all Thuringian states are monarchies. Politically, the Thuringian duchies and principalities have little agency of their own and are constantly being influenced by either Prussia, Austria or their dynastic relatives in Saxony. With German nationalism on the rise, however, change might be on the horizon, and some Thuringian states have already begun sharing courts and administrative institutions in the past years."

The liberal and national ideas that evolve in Jena reverberate across all of Germany."
THU_idea_wartburg: "The Wartburg"
THU_idea_wartburg_desc: "The Wartburg towers above Eisenach in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, right at the Hessian border. First mentioned in 1080, the Wartburg is undoubtedly one of Germany's most famous and romantic castles, known for hosting Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, the anathemized Martin Luther while he translated the Bible, and the great German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Over the past centuries, it has fallen into a state of disrepair. Nevertheless, it is seen as a German national symbol and therefore attracts liberal and nationalist fraternities. Every year, patriotic students and professors meet at the castle to protest against reactionary politics and for German unification."

##Country Leader Descriptions
HAN_GEORG_V_LEADER_DESC: "Despite losing his eyesight to both childhood illness and an accident in his teenage years, Georg V was still deemed fit to rule over Hanover by his father, Ernst August. His autocratic tendencies have led him to clash with the more liberal Hanoverian Landtag on several occasions, and Georg is not a very strong supporter of industrial development.\n\nInstead he prefers the old ways and continues to be an outspoken (and very stubborn) supporter of Austria and continued Hanoverian independence. Whether he will be able to help Austria maintain its strength and ensure his dynasty's rule over his domain will determine whether Georg V is fated to be the last King of Hanover."
HSD_LUDWIG_III_LEADER_DESC: "A military enthusiast and initially popular among Hessian liberals upon ascending to the throne in 1848, Ludwig III has since shown himself to be an ineffective ruler. The Grand Duke has not firmly placed himself in any political camp or demonstrated strong convictions and has largely allowed and relied on his ministers to make decisions and enact policies; he has however, gradually reversed some of the country's liberal reforms such as freedom of the press and association. Wanting to ensure the continuation of his dynasty and Hesse-Darmstadt's sovereignty, Ludwig has further aligned the Grand Duchy with Austria, and, to a lesser extent, France. If Ludwig wants to succeed in his efforts, he may need to reallocate much of his time spent being a patron of history and the arts to becoming a stronger and more effective leader."
