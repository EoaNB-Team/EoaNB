The minarets of 19 of the city's 24 mosques were demolished, and only 2 of the 7 churches remain usable. Among the destroyed buildings is the Siyavush Mosque, which was abandoned after the earthquake. According to eyewitness accounts, the roof of the minaret of the Bash Cheshme Mosque, toppled over and stuck its spire into the minaret's spire. One of the arches of the newly built St Nedelya Cathedral also fell. The earthquake kills 4 people, including two children at the Siyavush Mosque and one of the construction workers at St. Nedelya. In some places around Sofia cracks opened in the ground, according to Filaretov the crack between Boyana and Dragalevtsi is over 20 cm wide and about 1.5 km long.
