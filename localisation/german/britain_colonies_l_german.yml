 britishoceania.56.d: "In 1860 much of the interior of Australia remained uncharted. Some Victorians, made wealthy from the gold rushes, were prepared to fund exploratory expeditions. They had three goals: scientific discovery, seeking new grazing land and finding a route for an overland telegraph line. South Australian explorer John McDouall Stuart had already discovered productive grazing country during several expeditions from Adelaide to north of Lake Eyre by the late 1850s. The Victorian Government and the Royal Society of Victoria, spurred by a desire to maintain Victoria's position as the 'most advanced' colony, funded the Victorian Exploring Expedition and set it the task of being the first to traverse Australia from south to north. The expedition, one of the most expensive in Australian history, was led by Robert O'Hara Burke, an Irishman with no exploration experience or skills in surveying or navigation. It was lavishly equipped with items including 50 gallons of rum to revive tired camels (there were 27 of them), and an oak table. The expedition's departure from Royal Park, Melbourne on 20th August 1860 was a public spectacle watched by about 15,000 people."

In June 1863, 2300 acres were grazed as a reserve for Coranderrk Aboriginal Station. Indigenous testimony shows that Coranderrk was product and profitable. Residents' literacy increased and a better diet led to improved health.

The Protestant community hall was decorated with an image showing William of Orange, the 17th-century English King, defeating Catholic armies at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland. Given the tension between Catholics and Protestants in Australia this was a provocative gesture. Crowds of Irish Catholics gathered outside the hall, singing republican Irish songs and throwing stones. As the group was beginning to disperse the windows of the hall opened and shots were fired into the mob. A Catholic boy was killed and a riot ensued."

Children between the ages of six and fifteen were obliged to attend school and their education was free. In addition, all government funding to church schools ceased. Most of the religious denominations, with the exception of the Roman Catholics, allowed their schools to form part of this new system. The Education Act, although contentious and accused of being politically motivated, was the first of its kind in the Australian colonies, and Victoria became one of the first regions in the world to offer free, secular and compulsory education."

The main hall of the Exhibition presented a very difference appearance to that which it were on the previous evening. The last exhibits to arrive had reached their appointed places, there was no trace of the confusion which a few hours before reigned supreme, and when the aisles were filled with the dense throng of visitors, the eye could not rest upon a fairer picture, for apart from the ornamental effects of some of the mere artistically disposed wares, the original decorations of the walls were aided by a profusion of flags, which ran in a partly coloured line from end to end of the building, and the softened light which streamed through the stained windows heightened the effect of the various animate and inanimate groupings. Visitors began to arrive long before inaugural ceremony was begun, and these wisely availed themselves of the opportunity to inspect the exhibits before the different compartments became too crowded for that operation to be accomplished with any degree of comfort."

 britishoceania.75.t: "Depression"
 britishoceania.75.d: "During the 1880s, there had been a speculative boom in the Australian property market. The optimistic climate was fostered by the commercial banks, and also led to the proliferation of non-bank institutions such as building societies; as they were operating in a free banking system, there were few legal restrictions on their operations, and there was no central bank of government-provided deposit guarantees. Consequently, these banks and related bodies lent extravagantly, for property development, but following the collapse of the land boom after 1888, a large number of enterprises that had borrowed money found themselves unable to repay these debts, and many began to declare bankruptcy. Banks and non-bank institutions came under increasing financial pressure, and the full extent of the crisis became apparent when the Federal Bank of Australia failed on the 30th of January 1893. The situation was particularly acute in Victoria, and on the 1st of May 1893, the Victorian government implemented a five-day bank holiday to ameliorate the financial panic and prevent any further run on the banks. By 17th May, 11 commercial bank in Sydney, Melbourne, as well as other locations in Australia, had temporarily or permanently closed their doors. -- A period of prosperity in the 1880s led to a wild speculation in land and buildings, and money poured in from England. Land companies, mortgage societies, municipal bodies, building societies, and a host of other organizations all clamoured for a share in the good things that were on offer, and probably 40,000,00 pounds flowed into Victoria during a period of six years. With so much money in circulation, a fictitious prosperity of a feverish sort resulted. The banks issued notes to the value of millions of pounds, and trade and industry flourish as never before. The reaction came quickly. Public confidence subsided just as quickly. A run commenced on the bank, and the bursting of the boom brought with it widespread disaster. 14 banks failed, twelve of those with 905 branches throughout Australia, had liabilities assessed at 166,000,000 pounds, and thousands of people lost the whole of their possessions. Bank notes in many cases became worthless, and Victoria reached the farthest depth of a financial depression. Unemployment became widespread, wages and prices dropped and bankruptcies followed one another."

During the 1872–1876 Challenger expedition to Indonesia, naturalist John Murray carried out extensive surveys. In 1886, Captain John Maclear of HMS Flying Fish, having discovered an anchorage in a bay that he named "Flying Fish Cove", landed a party and made a small collection of the flora and fauna. In the next year, Pelham Aldrich, on board HMS Egeria, visited the island for 10 days, accompanied by J. J. Lister, who gathered a larger biological and mineralogical collection. Among the rocks then obtained and submitted to Murray for examination were many of nearly pure phosphate of lime. This discovery led to annexation of the island by the British Crown"

 britishcaribbean.2.t: "Morant Bay Trial"
 britishcaribbean.2.d: "A black man was put on trial in the Morant Bay courthouse, charged with trespassing on a long-abandoned sugar plantation. The poor black Jamaicans of the parish were angered by this additional example of land inequality, and marched on the courthouse under the leadership of Bogle.\n\nAlthough the march was peaceful, the proceedings were disrupted when James Geoghegon, a black spectator, angrily denounced the charges. In the police's attempts to seize him and remove him from the courthouse, a fight broke out between the police and other spectators. While pursuing Geoghegon, two policemen were beaten with sticks and stones thrown from the crowd. The local authorities will most likely convict Geoghegon and send him to prison.\n\nDomestic affairs like this are typically handled by local officials, but we have the opportunity to intervene here if we can afford to pull a few strings."

 britishcaribbean.2.b: "Geoghegon only expressed his opinion, intervene in this biased trial!"
 britishcaribbean.3.t: "Morant Bay Trial Aftermath"
 britishcaribbean.3.d: "The trial continued and Geoghegon was convicted and imprisoned. The following Monday the court issued arrest warrants for several men for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police.\n\nAmong those warrants was one issued directing the arrest preacher Paul Bogle. The police were unable to arrest Bogle because of the interference by his followers."

 britishcaribbean.4.a: "At least some good came from it..."
 britishcaribbean.5.t: "Morant Bay Rebellion"
 britishcaribbean.5.d: "The Morant Bay Protest started out in southeastern [689.GetName], who were protesting racial injustice, widespread poverty, and high poll taxes.\n\nThis then turned into an insurrection when several hundred Jamaican peasant-laborers marched into the town of Morant Bay, the capital of the predominantly sugar-growing parish of St. Thomas in the East. They then raided the police station and stole the weapons stored there. The crowd then began pelting the militia with rocks and sticks, and the militia opened fire on the protesters. This angered the crowd, who reacted violently, burning the court house and nearby buildings. More than 25 people were killed on both sides, before the militia retreated. For the next two days, the mass of rebellious black peasants took over the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-East.\n\nThe response of local authorities is to end this swiftly by suppressing the revolt and it's leaders. The only question remains, what shall we do about this insurrection?"
 britishcaribbean.5.a: "Ignore the issue and let the local authorities handle this insurrection."
 britishcaribbean.5.b: "The revolt will end if we appease some of their demands for racial equality."
 britishcaribbean.6.t: "Morant Bay Rebellion Aftermath"
 britishcaribbean.6.d: "According to one soldier, 'we slaughtered all before us ... man or woman or child'. In the end, the soldiers killed 439 black Jamaicans directly, and they arrested 354 more (including Paul Bogle), who were later executed, many without proper trials. Bogle was executed \"either the same evening he was tried or the next morning\". Bogle was hanged alongside 14 others, including his brother Moses.\n\nOther punishments included flogging of more than 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences. The soldiers burned thousands of homes belonging to black Jamaicans without any justifiable reason, leaving families homeless throughout the parish. This was the most severe suppression of unrest in the history of the British West Indies, exceeding incidents during slavery years."

In 1871, Sultan Ali of Perak died. However, Raja Abdullah, the heir apparent, had not been present at his funeral. Raja Bendahara Sultan Ismail was proclaimed Sultan of Perak instead.

 britishindia.17.d: "The British East India company was founded on December 31st, 1600, as a joint-stock company with the goal of destroying Spanish and Portuguese monopolies on the Indian Ocean Trade. The Company soon eclipsed the Dutch and Portuguese, along with the French after the Seven Years’ War, were they established a monopoly over colonialism in Asia, as well as trade in Asia. Indian opium, tea, silk, and saltpetre gave the company a reliable, convenient, and plentiful source of income. Although everything seemed to be going swimmingly, the situation within the Raj was reaching a boiling point. The British East India Company had been exploiting ethnic, religious, and tribal differences in order to attain control over the subcontinent. The Company had also enacted many unpopular western reforms that went against the beliefs of the locals, and new tariffs, along with other trade restrictions enacted by the crown, would cripple the internal economy of the Mughal Empire, reversing the proto-industrialization that was left over from the Mughal Empire, and the rich and prosperous eternal economy. Famines also became a glaring problem within Indian society, with over 60 million dying in famines between the 18th and 20th centuries. Many of these problems, as well as the introduction of cartridges made of pig skin into the army and the burden of British Rule, would result in the Sepoy Rebellion Of 1857 (Indian Mutiny). This is a decisive moment in British History, as the “Jewel Of The British Empire”, could soon fall back into the hands of the natives, or it could also be the start of an age of brutal repression, with an increased effort to assimilate the Indian subcontinent into the British Empire…"
