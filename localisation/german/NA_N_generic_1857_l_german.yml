Due to the inability of the Federal government to stop the flocking of settlers, [NEZ.GetName] defended it's territory outlined by the Walla Walla Treaty of 1855. As a consequence of neglecting the settlement crises conflicts are regular.\n\nA proposition has been made to federalize 90% of the [NEZ.GetAdjective] Reservation in an attempt to better regulate the creation of settlements. It's an attempt to maximize resource exploitation and minimize settler/native conflicts.\n\nThe only issue is with the [NEZ.GetName], who find this proposal to be highly controversial. The tribes are split between accepting and rejecting this proposal, but they dont have much leverage in our negotiation. They have again and again asked us to uphold the territories outlined by the Walla Walla Treaty of 1850 and to remove unlawful settlements. Though this would certainly remove our access to the rich gold mines of the [1074.GetName] Reservation.\n\nWith that in mind, one question remains... What shall we do?"

It's an attempt to maximize resource exploitation and minimize settler/native conflicts.\n\nMany people throughout the [NEZ.GetName] find this proposal to be highly controversial. Our tribe is split between accepting and rejecting this proposal, but we dont have much leverage in our negotiation. Chief Hallalhotsoot, the Lawyer Chief, negotiated the original Walla Walla Treaty of 1855. He has navigated politics to give us the best possible deal before, and has manged to secure a small portion of our original territory to stay as our own. The Lawyer Chief states that military conflict with the United States is futile, that it is best to diplomatically secure our existance.\n\nThough not all are agree with the Lawyer Chief's outlook. Some, such as Chief Joseph, resent this treaty and reject it entirely. The aftermath of this treat has divided the tribe between those who will go and those who will stay and fight."

The other Nez Perce leaders, including Chief Joseph, considered military resistance to be futile; they agreed to the move and reported as ordered to Fort Lapwai, Idaho Territory.\n\nOne of the major concerns of the leaders was that they have sufficient time to prepare to leave and to move their livestock. They wanted to wait until autumn as a minimum, or ideally, a year. Toohoolhoolzote also expressed the natives' reluctance to sell their land, which went against their religious beliefs. The military, on the other hand, demanded that they be moved in 30 days, or the soldiers would use force. General Oliver O.

Thirty days you have to get on the reservation.'\n'You ask me to talk, then tell me to say no more,' Toohoolhoolzote replied. 'I am chief! I ask no man to come and tell me anything what I must do.

However, the discovery of gold within the Rocky Mountains brought on a gold rush and a consequent flood of white emigration across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands.\n\nColorado territorial officials are pressuring federal authorities to redefine the extent of Indians treaty lands.

The Cheyenne chiefs were Black Kettle, White Antelope, Lean Bear, Little Wolf, Tall Bear, and Left Hand; the Arapaho chiefs were Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, and Big Mouth.\n\nMany Cheyenne claim the signature is illegitimate due to it not being made with a consensus of all tribe members.

The Cheyenne chiefs were Black Kettle, White Antelope, Lean Bear, Little Wolf, Tall Bear, and Left Hand; the Arapaho chiefs were Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, and Big Mouth.\n\nThe new reserve, less than one-thirteenth the size of the 1851 reserve, was located in eastern Colorado along the Arkansas River between the northern boundary of New Mexico and Sand Creek. Many Cheyennes are opposed to the treaty. That it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe, that the signatories had not understood what they signed, and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts. The whites, however, claimed the treaty was a 'solemn obligation' and considered that those Indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war."

Thus it was free to take the cattle into their encampments, but they did not believe us and the argument escalated to self defence when the soldier proceeded to take our cattle without our consent."

He claimed the Indians started the battle; the Indians claimed the soldiers attacked them. Eayre claimed that he killed 28 Indians at a loss of four men of his own. George Bent claimed that only three Indians were killed, but among the Indian dead was Lean Bear, a prominent Dog Soldier leader. Eayre finished his raid on an encampment near Fort Larned, where 240 of his horses and mules were stolen by the Kiowa. Arapahoes offering assistance to recover the stolen horses were fired on by Colorado soldiers and thereafter turned hostile.\n\nThe Cheyenne report a different story. Less than 15 months after meeting President Lincoln in Washington, Lean Bear, Black Kettle, and others in the tribe were camping on their buffalo hunting grounds near Ash Creek. The 1st Colorado Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant George Eayre, approached the group. Positive that this would be a peaceful encounter, Lean Bear went alone to meet the militia to show his peaceful intentions. On his chest, Lean Bear proudly wore his peace medal that he had received on his trip to Washington D.C. in 1863. In his hand, he held an official document signed by Lincoln stating that he was peaceful and friendly with whites. What Lean Bear did not realize was that Eayre's troops were operating under orders from Colonel John M. Chivington to 'kill Cheyennes whenever and wherever found.'

This city will be built around a central circus 2km in diameter, within which will be contained the world's largest totem pole and area of worship, a collosal offering to our gods and ancestors, and an incredible monument to our power and wealth.

The shamans in their white coats and overalls stood shoulder to shoulder with generals and chiefs. One evening, long ago, an elderly Cherokee Brave told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people. He said, 'My son, there is a battle between two wolves inside us all.  One is evil.  It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt,resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other wolf is good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.' The grandson thought abut it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, 'Which wolf wins?' The old Cherokee simply replied, 'The one you feed.' There was a low drone as the test plane zipped overhead, and a crackle on the radio of the pilot asking for his next orders. The general gave the go-ahead and moments later the second bomb touched down on the range. There was a crack, and then a flash."

nativemilitary.3.d:0 "A wendigo, is an evil spirit which originates from the darkest folklore of this land. The Wendigo is often said to be a malevolent spirit, sometimes depicted as a creature with human-like characteristics, which possesses human beings. It is known to invoke feelings of insatiable greed/hunger in men, the desire to cannibalize other humans, as well as the propensity to commit murder in those that fall under its influence. The Wendigo is gaunt to the point of emaciation, its desiccated skin pulled tightly over its bones. With its bones pushing out against its skin, its complexion the ash-gray of death, and its eyes pushed back deep into their sockets, the Wendigo looks like a skeleton recently disinterred from the grave. What lips it has are tattered and bloody ... Unclean and suffering from decay of the flesh, and it gives off a strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition, of death and corruption. This terrible creature stalks in the night, capturing an consuming it's prey, and is truly a figure to be feared. But it's just a myth, right? The truth is, stranger than fiction. These 'wendigo' are not mythical ravenous man-eating monsters, but men, dressed all in black, who hunt in the night. A battalion of soldiers specially trained in the mastery of night-fighting and hunting, and sworn to fight for their people until the very bitter end. These stalkers can track american troops for days, weeks even, calculating their number and understanding their behavior by what they leave behind. They can pull men from their tends, sabotage stores, release horses to run, and cause untold chaos behind enemy lines. Truly, the most feared monster here is in fact man."

TAIPA_GIBSON_DESC:0 "Many thought the previous chief was ruthless in his treatment of the Americans, with very few giving any thought to who was feeding him ideas. Annette Taipa Gibson was the reigning crown-princess of terror during the eviction of the USA, and stands ready to show the world that they ain't seen nothing yet. Don't worry, she doesn't bite...much."
WOLFS_HEAD_DESC:0 "Adam Wolf's Head is a very popular man. Former president of the board of shareholders at Sioux Telegraphy, he's a millionare philathropist, businessman, race-car driver, and many other things including the owner of the world's greasiest mosutache. He's also slightly corrupt and highly profiteering, with a copy of Atlas Shrugged instead of morals."
