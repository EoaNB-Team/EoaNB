 FRA_napoleon_description_impending_coma_text: "Napoleon III enters a state of alarming physical decline. His skin turns pale, his breathing grows shallow, and he struggles to remain conscious. Conversations pass without recognition, and his speech becomes slurred and incoherent. Attending physicians gather at his bedside, exchanging anxious glances as they observe signs pointing to a possible coma. The court falls into silence; ministers wait in tense anticipation, fearing the Emperor may slip beyond recovery."
 FRA_napoleon_description_serious_illness_text: "The Emperor now lies in the grip of serious illness. Fever rages through his body, and he suffers from intense abdominal pain—likely stemming from his ongoing urological condition. He can no longer sit upright without support, and his once-firm grip on political matters weakens as the illness takes its toll. The Empress and his closest advisors stand watch, while doctors administer treatments with limited success. Rumors of his deteriorating health begin to spread beyond the palace, causing uncertainty in the capital."
 FRA_napoleon_description_improving_situation_text: "After days of grave concern, signs of improvement begin to emerge. Napoleon III regains some clarity, his fever subsides, and he asks for correspondence and briefings. Though still confined to bed, he shows interest in state affairs and offers simple instructions to his ministers. His physicians remain cautiously optimistic, noting that his strength returns slowly but steadily. The court, once somber, begins to breathe easier as the shadow of crisis recedes—though recovery is far from complete."
 FRA_napoleon_description_all_is_well_text: "Napoleon III returns fully to health, rising from his bed with renewed strength and focus. He resumes his daily routines, receiving officials and attending to matters of state. His public appearances dispel lingering doubts, and newspapers across France report triumphantly on his recovery. The empire, briefly shaken by fears of succession and instability, rests once again under the steady hand of its sovereign. Though the memory of illness lingers, the Emperor stands restored—both in body and in authority."

 FRA_decision_enact_loi_ollivier: "Enact the Olliver Law"
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_ollivier_desc: "Proposed by the liberal politician Émile Ollivier, this law will allow the repeal of the 1791 law Le Chapellier that made the rallying of peasants and workers illegal. Viewed as a first step towards a friendlier government for the poor class, its enactment will calm down the republicans and the socialist movement."
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_duruy: "Enact the Duruy Law"
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_duruy_desc: "The law proposed by Victor Duruy aims to improve schooling. After debate the law content is the following :\n- Obligation to have an elementary school in all towns with more 500 inhabitants (800 in the Falloux Law 1850)\n- Improvement of the teacher salaries\n- The towns, the Departments and France can finance elementary otherwise the parents pay to send their children.\n- Authorisation of towns to give money to hardworking children to improve school frequentation (school stays facultative to keep father liberty).\n- History and Geography are mandatory"
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_niel: "Enact the Niel Law"
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_niel_desc: "The War Minister, the Marshal Adolphe Niel shares with Napoleon III the admiration of the Prussian military administration. In Prussia all men between 20 and 40 must do military service. In France, conscription is still done by lottery and the rich can pay other to serve in their place to avoid it. Even if the number of active soldiers of both countries are comparable, the French Army must divide its soldiers between colonies and the reserve is not ready to fight. Adolphe Niel estimated that there are 200,000 French soldiers who can defend the Rhine against up to 350,000 Prussians (double with the reserve). Adolphe Niel proposed the \"Garde Nationale mobile\" a copy of the Prussian military system, but the people and the deputies don’t want it."
 FRA_decision_general_amnesty: "Offer a General Amnesty"
 FRA_decision_general_amnesty_desc: "This will drift the country more towards autocracy."
 FRA_decision_thiers_diplomatic_mission: "Send Thiers on a Diplomatic Mission"

 FRA_latin_monetary_union_establishment: "Founding Treaty of Latin Monetary Union"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_establishment_desc: "France is, as all other nations, dependent on the exchange of trade between peoples. In the recognition of this truth, an interesting proposition has come forth from within trade commissions and economic circles...\n\nA typical inconvenience in international trade are unfixed exchange rates between currencies, as each currency follows its own standards of minting, weighing and metal composition. This leads to exchange uncertainty, as a trader in France may not get the value of goods for the weight of his coin abroad. Thusly, a proposal for a so-called 'Monetary Union' has been presented.\n\nThis 'Union' would, if agreed upon by other nations, standardize exchange rates between nations. This would make it so that coins from abroad can be exchanged for the French Franc at a set equal value, per bimetallic standard, both ways. This would make trade a much simpler and effective affair, but requires some fellow nations to participate... shall we form this Monetary Union?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_greece: "Ask Greece to join us!"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_greece_desc: "The Greeks have expressed an interest in joining the LMU, citing one of the clauses of the treaty which allows nations willing to abide by the treaty's stipulations to join the union's member states. The Kingdom of Greece lies in a valuable position to contest the waters along the Bosphorus, and letting them into the union may work just as much as a diplomatic move as an economic one... shall Greece enter the Monetary Union?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_russia: "Bilateral agreement with Russia"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_russia_desc: "While St. Petersburg has expressed no desire in joining the treaty, the interest of the equal exchange concept has not fallen on deaf ears it seems. A separate agreement may be able to be struck, however, but with exchange rates being standardized from banks of the member unions in relation to the Bank of Russia, with regards to fiscal and monetary notes. This agreement, while different, could make trade simpler for our partners in Russia."
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_spain: "Bilateral agreement with Spain"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_spain_desc: "Spain is doubtful of the implications of the treaty, and negotiations have thusfar been fruitless despite interest in the concept. A bilateral agreement might be beneficial as a replacement to union membership, even if the agreement has to be slightly slanted to the Spaniards..."
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_romania: "Bilateral agreement with Romania"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_romania_desc: "The newly founded nation of the Romanian people have expressed an interest in our currency union, and is willing to enter as a member. However, disagreements in treaty application and organization has lead to unsuccessful negotiations, and Romania remains outside the agreement. Despite the concessions, perhaps we can persuade the Romanians with a modified bilateral agreement?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_austria_hungary: "Bilateral agreement with Austria-Hungary"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_austria_hungary_desc: "Vienna has expressed a clear rejection of the LMU treaty and its stipulations, reasoning that a bimetallic monetary system is not appealing to their economic interests, as their own system is that of a monometallic monetary system. Maybe we could persuade them with an agreement of equal exchange between our gold Francs and their Florin between treasuries?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_monaco: "Bilateral agreement with Monaco"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_monaco_desc: "Our small neighbour in the south, Monaco, is tied to us in a way that is inseverable. They do not want a full membership in our union, but have expressed a positive desire to make use of the LMU standard for trade between currencies. An agreement would be most beneficial for us both."
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_serbia: "Unilateral agreement with Serbia"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_serbia_desc: "The Serbians are not interested in participating directly in the union and its exchanges, but has shown to want to make use of the LMU standard for coin minting. While we can't make them abide by our standardization and exchange rate due to metal percentages being different, we could perhaps set special exchange rates between their standard and ours?"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_bulgaria: "Unilateral agreement with Bulgaria"
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_bulgaria_desc: "Bulgaria, much like Serbia, does not want to enter the union but does want to use the LMU standardization of minting. We could make a unilateral agreement which would exchange union currency at a rate which is equal to the value of the Bulgarian coins; all we need to know is if the Bulgarian's will agree to this or not..."

In 1832 he was awarded Swiss nationality. 1832 was also the year of the death of the son of Napoleon the First. Charles-Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte became the leader of the Bonaparte dynasty as his brothers are also dead. He attempted several uprisings, most notably Strasbourg (1836) and Boulogne-sur-Mer (1840).

The Official Candidate, Charles de Morny, is in a very confortable place, being a close ally of the Empire and a popular figure among the politicians. Michel Goudchaux has little support, as the opposition is still split between republicans and monarchists, allowing it to be outshined."

 france.801.t: "Death of Eugène-François Vidocq"
 france.801.d: "The great adventurer Eugène-François Vidocq has passed away today, at the age of 81. He started his life as a bandit, but after a life of evading his prison sentence, he first became an informer for the police, then created the first private detective agency, creating at the same time the basis of modern judicial police in France. After many years of great service to the french police, he will still be remembered."
 france.801.a: "A great loss for France."

 france.802.t: "Extention of Paris"
 france.802.d: "For decades, Paris has been confined to the Wall of the Ferme générale. But in this century, its population has increased greatly, and now suburbs have appeared all around it, inside the Wall of Thiers, built in 1840. Haussmann had in his plan to expand the city to this wall, incorporating those small communities and redoing entirely the map of Paris' Arrondissements. This is another step in Haussmann's great reorganization of the city."
 france.802.a: "Paris becomes greater everyday!"

 france.803.t: "Creation of the Société Générale"
 france.803.d: "In 1848, the banks of France failed, and the economy of the Empire was hit hard by economic recession. The idea of a national bank gained popularity. The creation of a credit based banking system was prompted by the new era of productivity that came with the Industrial Revolution, as the people now consumed more and more. The Société Générale was founded, owned by the government, it was the first bank to offer an industrial distribution of credits."
 france.803.a: "New banks for a new world."

 france.804.d: "Following the cruel and bloody antisemitic treatment of jews in Damas in 1840 and the forced conversion to christianity of the young Edgard de Mortara in 1858, Adolphe Crémieux has announced the creation of the Alliance Israélite Universelle, or AIU. This association aims to protect the jewish community and to promote human rights and the discussion between religions around the world."
 france.804.a: "A step further in the emancipation of the jews."

 france.805.t: "The Metz Universal Exhibition"
 france.805.d: "This year, Metz organized a universal exhibition to present the newest advancements in agriculture and industry. Even if it's not a true universal exhibition, like the 1862 one being planned in London, this one takes place on a more local level, showcasing in different divisions the new inventions in agriculture, horticulture and in industrial engineering."

 france.806.t: "'Les Misérables' - a Best Seller"
 france.806.d: "Two weeks ago, Victor Hugo, a well-established French author previously known for his novel 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' (1831), published another novel by the name of 'Les Misérables'. Hugo, who has been living in exile since the French coup d'état of 1851, has completed his work on 'Les Misérables' on Guernsey (Channel Islands). The novel provides a powerful literary insight into the societal conditions among the poorest classes of France in the early 19th century. It follows the story of members of the lower classes, among them former prisoner Jean Valjean, between the Battle at Waterloo (1815) and the Paris Uprising in June 1832.\n\nHugo's latest publication has already made a lot of noise, and despite mixed critiques it became an instant best seller and might already be considered one of the most successful novels of the 19th century."

 france.808.t: "The Search for Planet 'Vulcan'"
 france.808.d: "In 1788, the orbit of planet Uranus (which was discovered in 1781) didn't follow the predicted path. Many astrophysicists have tried to fix the model without success. In 1821, Alexis Bouvard gathered 40 years of observations but didn't succeed in fixing the model but suggested the existence of a planet yet unknown. The British astronomer John Couch Adams advanced the science on it but it was French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier who calculated the orbit of this unknown planet in 1845. The Prussian astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle then observed the planet, which would later be called Neptune, in 1846.\n\nLe Verrier now tried to do the same thing to explain anomalies within Mercury's orbit. In January 1859, doctor an hobby astronomer Edmond Lescarbault sent a letter to Le Verrier to report an observation of a celestial body yet unknown. Le Verrier recently announced that the sighted celestial body, which he named 'Vulcan', must be the planet that was responsible for the altered orbit of Mercury. We expect further observations will confirm the 9th planet of our solar system which is placed between Mercury and the Sun."
 france.808.a: "The Ninth Planet of the Solar System?"

 france.809.t: "Hidden in Plain Sight"
 france.809.d: "Renowned French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier has just announced the potential discovery of a new inter-mercurial object. The sighting of the alleged planet was first recorded by French village doctor and hobby astronomer Edmond Lescarbault just months prior. If these findings are verified, 'Vulcan', as some astronomers are calling it, will be the second planet to be discovered by prediction following Le Verrier's solar-gravitational models (discrepancies between the motion of Uranus and the model had led to the discovery of Neptune a decade ago in 1846) and will further professionialise the use of mathematical models to make discoveries in the celestial sky.\n\nAlthough Le Verrier is an acknowledged astrophysicist, many other astronomers are describing this new discovery as proposterous at worst and faulty at best. An inter-mercurial object would have been discovered centuries if not millennia earlier, as any sizable object in this close proximity to the sun would have been recorded much sooner than now."
 france.809.a: "My god, another one?!"

 france.810.t: "La Première Internationale"
 france.810.d: "Following widespread unrest in the 1860s, French and British workers started to discuss developing a closer collaboration. Henri Tolain, Joseph Perrachon and Charles Limousin visited London in July 1863, attending a meeting in St. James's Hall in honour of earlier uprisings. They discussed the need for an international organisation, which would among other things prevent the import of foreign workers to break strikes. In September 1864, French and British delegates again met in London, this time to set up an organization for sharing labor information across borders."

 france.813.t: "Suez Canal Construction set to Start"
 france.813.d: "A long-held dream may finally come true: a canal connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea.\n\nAfter obtaining a concession from Sa'id Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan, that would allow the construction of a canal across the Egyptian desert connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, a multinational commission drafted a precise plan on how to construct the Suez Canal. After that, former French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps, the main initiator behind the plan, successfully managed to secure the funding for the giant project. A Suez Canal Company has been set up to oversee the construction process and will be allowed to operate the canal for 99 years from its opening.\n\nThe final planning for the construction of the Suez Canal has now been completed.

 france.901.d: "Following the recent formation of the provisionnal government of France, ministers and socialist leaders were trying to find a compromise, and to agree on a future course of action for the French Republic. However, the military wanted otherwise. Led by the legetimist general Patrice de Mac-Mahon, the French Army has toppled the nascent republican government, and has installed their own military junta. The short-term republic is still defended by many in France, and that coup will probably be followed by more chaos, as France recovers from their war against Prussia."
 france.901.a: "A short lived republic"

 france.902.t: "Military revolts against the French Republic"
 france.902.d: "The recent attempt at arresting the French general Patrice de Mac-Mahon has been a disaster for the newly formed French republican government. The Army has organized themselves, and has risen up against the regime. Led by Mac-Mahon himself, the military revolt has taken hold of South-Western France already, and are already fighting against the loyalist army of France. This turn of events is one of the many tribulations France has faced since the start of the war, and it seems unlikely that they will stop anytime soon."
 france.902.a: "There are some nostalgic of the Empire"

 france.903.t: "The End of the French Empire"
 france.903.d: "Following the capture of the French Emperor in this most recent war with the Prussians, a political power vacuum was created with the effective capture of the cheif executive of the french government. Republicans within the French Imperial Government seized the oppurtunity and declared a new Republic. Making this the 3rd French Republic, and, depending on how you count, the 12th French government in 90 years."

 nap_france.30.d: "Made famous by Victor Hugo's 1831 novel 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame', the beautiful cathedral on Île de la Cité in the middle of the Seine was the coronation site of Napoleon Bonaparte. The cathedral has now been restored after 20 years of work directed by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc (and the late Jean-Baptiste Lasus).

 france.171.t: "Napoleon III is ill!"
 france.171.d: "The doctors discovered a bladder stone in Napoleon III, responsible for numerous severe pain in the lower abdomen and urinary discomfort. The 6 years spent imprisoned at Ham between 1840 and 1846 have fragilized his health. Combining rheumatism, haemorrhoidal attacks, digestive problems and gout attacks, the Emperor went to Plombières and then Vichy each year for a cure, making these two towns famous. But it is not enough, he has more and more crisis."

 france.173.a: "Thank God for our Empress!"

 france.174.t: "Napoleon and his urinary problems..."
 france.174.d: "Napoleon III is at his worst. But no one wants to take the risk of operating on him. Senate President Troplong and Field Marshal Niel, both also suffering from a bladder stone, died as a result of the operation. The seriousness of the disease is underestimated for "the greater good".\nHorseback riding is very painful for Napoleon III, people worried. Especially when our relations with Prussia and it's allies are getting worse. Let's hope it won't negatively influence our military during the coming war."

 france.175.t: "Liver Operation Fails"
 france.175.d: "The surgery on Emperor Napoleon III has narrowly succeeded in saving his life, but the outcome is far from ideal. The emperor emerges weakened and visibly aged, unable to fully resume his former duties. Though he still holds the imperial title, power now increasingly shifts to his advisors and inner circle. The court is uneasy, and doubts grow about the long-term stability of the Empire."
 france.175.a: "He lives, but the Empire must adapt."

 france.176.t: "Liver Operation Succeeds"
 france.176.d: "Against all expectations, the emperor’s surgery has been a success. Napoleon III has recovered swiftly and now returns to the reins of power with newfound vigor. His appearance in public has rallied the French people, and his renewed leadership has breathed fresh life into the empire. The future of France looks stronger than ever under his restored command."
 france.176.a: "Long live the Emperor!"

 france.192.t: "The Emperor is under Attack!"
 france.192.d: "It's 8:30 pm, the imperial cortege arrives on the Boulevard des Italiens; the entourage is led by a squadron of lancers, followed by the Emperor's personal sedan — and thirty meters further back is Princess Mathilde's carriage. The assembly takes a left onto Rue Le Peletier, where the opera is located opposite number nineteen. The convoy stops there, awaiting for its departure. An eerie silence sweeps over the area, followed by a screeching explosion. A small bomb had been thrown below the horses of the lancers, sending the stallions fleeing from the streets. The crowds that had gathered gasped at the disturbance, as cries of panic followed en suite. Not a moment later, does the choir of screeches strum again, as a second bomb lands below the hitch and a third below the Emperor's sedan, turning it on its side and shattering the glass windows. The screeches turn to cries as the guards race to the sedan and open the car door..."

The third and fourth bomb destroyed the Imperial luxury salon and sedan. The Emperor and the Empress were covered in blood but they are safe and sound. The steel walls of the car have protected them. The Imperial couple continued on to the theatre to show they are alive."

 nap_france.6.t: "Proposition for a trade treaty between France and the United Kingdom"
 nap_france.6.d: "Even if France and the United Kingdom share the same historical rivalry, we still believe in the same ideals, and also in the same economic principles. Putting aside our differences, an economic treaty between us will strenghten our bond even more after both the Second Opium War and the Crimean War, something that can only benefit both of us.

While we watch the fight from far away across the Atlantic, we are forced to admit that the matter of the United States has an impact on the entire world, and so we need to make our opinion on the matter clear. On one hand, the Confederates States of America, or CSA, have all of the precious cotton and if independent, will be an important player in the Caribbean Sea, where we have holdings, so supporting them would allow us a better control of the area. On the other hand, the United States have always been a close partner, and our shared history allow us a closer relations, on top of the fact that they have superior numbers and industry and is so likely to win the civil war. We could, of course, always take a neutral stance on the matter. We win nothing but at least we don't loose anything if we bet on the wrong side."

 # ADVISORS AND GENERALS EVENTS
 france.601.t: "Death of Charles de Morny"
 france.601.d: "Half-brother of Napoleon III, Charles de Morny stood out for his influence and undeniable political negotiation skills. His mastery of compromise and swaths of talents, from finance to the world of salons, allowed Louis-Napoleon to claim the imperial throne in the coup of 1851. Though his politics were more pragmatic than ideological, his backroom deals and preference to moderation helped preserve the stability of the Empire's regime, for better or for worse. His death has left a gap in the imperial court, and all of France will seldom find a man so committed to stability and safety."
 france.601.a: "The courts fell silent."
 france.601.b: "Prepare an Imperial funeral for Morny."

 france.602.t: "Death of Claude Alphonse Delangle"
 france.602.d: "Claude Alphonse Delangle, a man of law and loyal servant of the Empire, has passed. As Minister of Justice and later magistrate, he embodied the conservative legal mind of his age, committed to stability, order, and the authority of the state. To allies, he was the bulwark of law and discipline; to critics, an instrument of autocracy cloaked in judicial robes. His steady defence of imperial interests ensured his place as one of the Empire's most dependable administrators. His death is a reminder that the guardians of law, no matter how steadfast, cannot outlast the march of time."
 france.602.a: "The scales of justice return to balance."
 france.602.b: "Prepare an Imperial funeral for Delangle."

 france.603.t: "Death of Pierre Jules Baroche"
 france.603.d: "A skilled lawyer and politician famous for his work in the Cours des Pairs and in the court of the Emperor, Pierre Jules Baroche passed away today. Among the most ardent defenders of Napoleon III, this man could be found defending imperial policy, often confronting liberal and republican critics with firm conviction. His belief that stability required strong centralized power helped his steady defence of the authority, alongside his legal expertise in protecting the regime. The loss of his expertise and loyalty will be felt by many, and celebrated by others."
 france.603.a: "As the gavel strikes, so too does the bell toll."
 france.603.b: "Prepare an Imperial funeral for Baroche."

 france.604.t: "Death of Jacques Louis Randon"
 france.604.d_FPW_historical: "Field Marshal Jacques Louis Randon, soldier and statesman, has died. From his long service in Algeria as Governor-General to his command as one of the Empire's most trusted officers, he embodied France's military ambition abroad and its reliance on steadfast generals at home. His career was not without controversy, as the conquest of Algeria was marked by both triumph and tragedy, yet his dedication to the Empire never wavered. Passing away in the shadow of France's defeat in 1871, his death closes the chapter on a life bound tightly to the fortunes of the Second Empire."
 france.604.d_FPW_althistory: "Field Marshal Jacques Louis Randon, soldier and statesman, has died. From his long service in Algeria as Governor-General to his command as one of the Empire's most trusted officers, he embodied France's military ambition abroad and its reliance on steadfast generals at home. His career was not without controversy, as the conquest of Algeria was marked by both triumph and tragedy, yet his dedication to the Empire never wavered. Passing away in the glory of France's victory in 1871, his death closes the chapter on a life bound tightly to the fortunes of the Second Empire."
 france.604.a: "A marshal of the Empire passes on."
 france.604.b: "Prepare an Imperial funeral for Randon."

 france.605.t: "Death of Victor de Pesigny"
 france.605.d: "A staunch ally and supporter of Napoleon III, Victor de Persigny was a conspirator from the very beginning. He played a critical role in the rise of the Empire, and unwaveringly supported his cause from the very start, a trait few in the political entourage can claim. His loyalty earned him high favour in the court of the Emperor, but his skills as orator and statesman proved not to live up to his loyalist fervor. To his admirers, Persigny embodied discipline, loyalty, and determination in service of the state. To his critics, he was little more than a heavy-handed enforcer and a lapdog of the Bonapartists. Whether one chooses to side with one, the other, or neither, few can say his loyalty was a fault."
 france.605.a: "The sole Bonapartist is no more."
 france.605.b: "Prepare an Imperial funeral for Pesigny."

 france.606.t: "Death of Prosper de Chasseloup-Laubat"
 france.606.d: "The Minister of Marine and Colonies, Prosper de Chasseloup-Laubat, has passed away. Few persons had as much of an impact on the Empire's foreign policy as he did, leading naval modernization and the growth of French colonies with tenacity and drive. His ideas and strategies gave the Empire a strong position on the international stage and allowed French power to go well beyond the boundaries of Europe. Even though the general public frequently ignored his efforts, his reputation was respected by those who served overseas. In addition to the loss of a statesman, his passing signifies the decline of one of the Empire's principal planners of colonial and naval strength."
 france.606.a: "A steward of Empire departs."
 france.606.b: "Prepare an Imperial funeral for Chasseloup-Laubat."

 france.607.t: "Death of Adolphe Thiers"
 france.607.d: "Adolphe Thiers, a man revered by the liberal constitutionalists and hated by the autocrats, has succumbed to a fatal stroke today. His fierce championing and dedication to the cause of constitutionalism and moderation, as well as his ardent criticism of the autocratic monarchy and revolutionaries, have earned him a place in [Root.GetAdjective] history as a man with little to no compromise. Whether or not one agrees with his views, his methods, and/or his influence, one cannot doubt his lasting legacy."
 france.607.a: "A titan of the chamber is gone."
 france.607.b: "Prepare an Imperial funeral for Thiers."

 france.608.t: "Passing of Gustave Rouland"
 france.608.d: "Gustave Rouland, magistrate and statesman, has passed away. As Minister of Education and Religious Affairs, his career was defined by his measured opposition to the growing influence of the Catholic Church. His reforms aimed to strengthen the role of the state in education, securing a path that balanced faith with governance. Quiet, deliberate, and steady, Rouland preferred the subtleties of law and administration to grand speeches or sweeping gestures. His loss is not marked by thunderous applause or outrage, but by the silence of a seasoned hand removed from the levers of the state."
 france.608.a: "The cautious reformer is laid to rest."
 france.608.b: "Prepare an Imperial funeral for Rouland."

 france.609.t: "Death of Michel Chevalier"
 france.609.d: "More than a talented economist, Michel Chevalier represented a new way of thinking for many in France. His pragmatic and moderate views on society helped shaped his career as a publicist and political economist. Supporting free trade, economic modernization, and using commerce as a vehicle for peace and prosperity, his many negotiations and economic reforms helped shape the French economy as we know it today, for better or worse. It can be said from all sides of the chamber; France has lost a great mind."
 france.609.a: "Commerce loses its champion."
 france.609.b: "Prepare an Imperial funeral for Chevalier."

 france.610.t: "Death of Léon Gambetta"
 france.610.d: "A fiery orator by nature, Léon Gambetta could be considered a founding father of Republican opposition to the Second Empire. A central figure in parliamentary republicanism, his life was mired in controversy and a desire for change with an almost radicalist fervor. Perhaps it is no surprise then that such a figure died shockingly early. Whilst many today argue the merits and flaws of ideologies spread across the chamber, many can also say his oratory skills were nothing short of sensational."
 france.610.a: "The voice of a republic is silenced."
 france.610.b: "Prepare an Imperial funeral for Gambetta."

 # EVENTS OF THE LATIN MONETARY UNION
 france.951.t: "Establishment of Latin Monetary Union"
 france.951.d: "Today, the governments of France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland have made a joint statement addressing the conclusion of discussions, and the founding of a new treaty union: The Latin Monetary Union.\n\nThe Latin Monetary Union, abreviated as the LMU, seeks to unify the currency of each member-state under one standardized system of mintage. This system makes the exchange rates of coinage between the members Italy, Switzerland, Belgium and France equal. This meaning the coins are united in value and are usable without conversion in all member nations, as long as the dimensions, weight and metal compositions remain mostly identical. The Union was a proposal made by French officials, and its founding would suggest a closer cooperation between each member-state's and French economic interests in Europe.\n\nWhat will become of this union over the ages, only time will tell..."
 france.951.a: "A union is born!"
 france.952.t: "Ask Greece to join Latin Monetary Union"
 france.952.d: "Our diplomats to Greece have reported a possibility to invite the Greeks into joining the FMU.\n\nFeelers among the diplomatic corps sent to Greece have gotten positive impressions of the potential prospects of a Greek entry into the FMU, and believe that giving them a direct invitation might be a good way to give off a good impression about the LMU. The Greeks are generally positive about the stipulations of the treaty, and have shown an definitive interest in the coinage standardization which the LMU offers, besides the currency having the strength of the other members economic backing.\n\nThere are many potential benefits for the Greeks if they decide to fully enter the monetary union, however, the decision ultimately falls to them."
 france.952.a: "Send our greetings!"
 france.953.t: "Bilateral agreement with Latin Monetary Union"
 france.953.d: "We do not agree with all the stipulations that the LMU imposes if we were to join as a full member, thusly making the treaty undesirable for our continued interest.\n\nHowever, while we aren't interested in joining the LMU as a full member-state it would still be prudent and a definitive necessity to interact with it on an economic basis. The standardizing of mintage and coinage is an appealing idea, but perhaps there are other ways of making a set exchange rate for our treasury or currency in relations to the LMU?\n\nThis way we could trade with the LMU on more equal terms without joining the union in full."
 france.953.a: "A bilateral agreement is desirable"
 france.953.b: "We do not want this"
 france.954.t: "Unilateral agreement with Latin Monetary Union"
 france.954.d: "The LMU system of coinage is an interesting idea which could be used to our advantage, despite us not being interested in the treaty. Perhaps we could make our own standard of exchange by the LMU system for our own purposes, while getting an agreement to make use of such a system in relation to exchange rates to the LMU and other associates with similar systems? This would give us the advantage of making a coinage which is usable for trade across many nations in Europe, while being more tailored to our own purposes."
 france.954.a: "Standardization it is!"
 france.954.b: "Our existing coins are sufficient"

 # Events: france.100 - france.105
 france.100.t: "A Choice for the Emperor"
 france.100.d: "The Orsini attempt has rocked Paris. Napoléon III must choose: stage reforms at the Palais Bourbon to placate moderates, rally the army at the Champ de Mars to reassure order, or crush conspirators by secret means. The Empress and ministers urge caution; the salons and the Rue de Rivoli already whisper of consequences. Each course will reshape the character of the Empire."
 france.100.a: "Call a Special Session at the Palais Bourbon and offer measured reforms"
 france.100.b: "Rally the army at the Champ de Mars and reward the generals"
 france.100.c: "Authorize the préfets to purge conspirators in secret"
 
 france.101.t: "A Special Sitting at the Palais Bourbon"
 france.101.d: "A carefully choreographed sitting of the Corps Législatif is planned; measured concessions are offered as political theatre to re-establish the Emperor's authority among deputies and the capital's bourgeoisie."
 france.101.a: "Open the Palais Bourbon session and present the staged reforms"
 france.101.b: "Postpone, refine the text and rehearse the deputies"
 
 france.102.t: "Marshals and Generals in Paris"
 france.102.d: "Senior commanders converge on the Tuileries and Champ de Mars — their goodwill is valuable, but the spectacle must be weighed against opinion in the chambers and among the people. The préfets and the administration will see the parades made neat, but Paris observes every pageant closely."
 france.102.a: "Grant honours at the Tuileries and secure the generals' pledges"
 france.102.b: "Keep ceremonies short and return the army to its barracks"
 
 france.103.t: "Patriotic Initiatives"
 france.103.d: "National exhibitions, colonial pageants and diplomatic gestures — staged with imperial flair — can rekindle popular pride and divert attention from domestic unease. Flags, regimental banners and even colonial contingents from Algeria lend spectacle."
 france.103.a: "Launch a national exhibition and colonial parade"
 france.103.b: "Issue proclamations and modest celebrations"
 
 france.104.t: "A Secret Directive"
 france.104.d: "A darker order: clandestine operations and summary measures handled quietly by préfets, the Sûreté and police into the night. Speedy and efficient, such methods risk feeding the salons and foreign presses and poisoning the Emperor's standing if exposed. This is the sort of thing the Rue de Rivoli would whisper about and which even the Empress might find troubling."
 france.104.a: "Authorize clandestine measures through the préfets"
 france.104.b: "Convene a public commission of inquiry and place suspects on trial"
 
 france.105.t: "A Family Gathering at the Tuileries"
 france.105.d: "A stately reunion at the Tuileries of the House of Bonaparte, provincial notables and city grandees — pageantry, speeches and favours meant to stitch together support and present the Emperor as the guarantor of order. Empress Eugénie will lend imperial grace to the ceremonies; the spectacle calls to mind the courts of old and the promise of dynastic continuity."
 france.105.a: "Stage the grand gathering"
 france.105.b: "Hold a modest commemoration"
 
  # Follow-up events

 france.110.a: "A cautious sigh from abroad"
 
 france.111.t: "Generals in the Capital"
 france.111.d: "The parade and audiences given to commanders in Paris have been watched by foreign chancelleries; Berlin interprets this as a nervous asserting of military prestige."
 france.111.a: "Remarked in Berlin"
 
 france.112.t: "News of a Crackdown"
 france.112.d: "Whispers of secret detentions and shadow tribunals have reached the foreign press. Diplomats signal discomfort and even some clubs murmur uneasily; the regime's critics sharpen their pens."
 france.112.a: "Diplomatic coolness and a stir at home"
 
 france.113.t: "Colonial Pageantry"
 france.113.d: "Public exhibitions and colonial pageants have brightened the capital and produced a small wave of patriotic fervour; abroad it reads as a confident, if cautious, display."
 france.113.a: "Appeals to pride"
 
 france.114.t: "Dynastic Reassurance"
 france.114.d: "The family gathering has sent a clear signal: the dynasty and its supporters remain united. Several courts adjust their expectations accordingly."
 france.114.a: "Diplomatic calm"
 
  # Scandal events and decisions
 france.120.t: "Leaks and Public Outrage"
 france.120.d: "The presses and cafés hum with stories of secret arrests and rough justice. Deputies and clubs press for explanations: a scandal of this nature tests the palace's relationships with conservative notables and the restless republican press alike."
 france.120.a: "Calls for a public inquiry and a calm answer"
 
 france.121.t: "Pressure Builds"
 france.121.d: "Letters, petitions and street meetings multiply. The Emperor must choose between forming a composed commission of jurists and magistrates to answer the public, or resisting entirely and risking continued agitation in the cafés and chambers."
 france.121.a: "The capital demands a composed commission"
 
 france.122.t: "Commission Established"
 france.122.d: "A composed commission — jurists, magistrates and respected figures — is convened and their measured report reassures many. A welcomed balm for foreign courts and for cautious deputies in the Palais Bourbon."
 france.122.a: "The commission reports; antiquated wounds are closed"

 # Events: Law of General Security chain
 france.1.t: "The Law of General Security"
 france.1.d: "Following the Orsini affair and the deepening unrest, the Emperor's ministers have drafted a sweeping Law of General Security. It permits the internment, exile, or deportation of suspects without the ordinary guarantees of justice. Conservatives hail it as a shield for the Empire; liberals decry it as a return to arbitrary rule. The Chamber murmurs; Paris watches."
 france.1.a: "Promulgate the law—order before all"
 france.1.b: "No—France shall not return to arbitrariness"

 france.2.t: "Tighten Public Instruction"
 france.2.d: "The Council now proposes to curb the excesses of philosophy and subversive instruction in lycées and faculties. The Ministry will direct curricula and suppress doctrines deemed corrosive to faith and loyalty. Our supporters predict a calmer youth; the opposition foresees a dimming of France’s intellectual light."
 france.2.a: "Curtail the teachings of philosophy"
 france.2.b: "Schools must remain free in spirit"

 france.3.t: "Require Legislative Allegiance"
 france.3.d: "To consolidate the Empire’s authority, certain deputies and senators might be required to pledge explicit allegiance to the imperial constitution. The measure would bind the Chambers to the Emperor’s policy—but risks igniting accusations of servility and despotism."
 france.3.a: "Bind the Chambers to the Emperor"
 france.3.b: "We rule by persuasion, not compulsion"

 # Events: Walewski to Britain
 france.20.t: "Walewski’s Mission to Britain"
 france.20.d: "Count Alexandre Walewski departs for London bearing the Emperor’s reassurances and requests. His task: soothe British anxieties, negotiate indulgences, and secure tacit cooperation. The courtiers whisper; Europe leans in."
 france.20.ok: "Proceed"

 france.21.t: "French Envoy in London"
 france.21.d: "Count Walewski presents the Emperor’s views with elegance and firmness. He hints at the need for British goodwill—and forbearance—toward imperial measures taken in the interest of security. Shall we meet him halfway?"
 france.21.a: "Receive Walewski warmly and oblige France"
 france.21.b: "Decline his overtures—Britain bows to none"
 france.22.t: "London Receives Walewski"
 france.22.d: "Word reaches the Tuileries: the British Cabinet received Count Walewski favourably. Concessions were made in tone and spirit, if not in parchment. For now, the Channel grows calmer; our measures may proceed with less foreign ire."
 france.23.t: "Walewski Rebuffed in London"
 france.23.d: "Dispatches from our envoy report a cool audience and a firmer British posture. London declines to indulge the Empire’s request. Relations have chilled; our margin to act narrows in the face of British scrutiny."
 france.22.ok: "Understood"
 france.23.ok: "Unfortunate"

 france.201.t: "The Invasion of Kabylia"
 france.201.d: "A fortified force of around 5,000 Kabyles have been holding out in the Kabylia region of our Algerian colony for some time now. We were informed today that General Randon, who took over the command of the troops in Algeria in May, has completed his preparations to finish off the last pocket of resistance in Algeria. We expect this final conquest of Algeria to be swift, the resistance in Kabylia should be cleared out shortly."

 france.202.t: "The French Invasion of 1857"
 france.202.d: "The time has finally come. The French have managed to organize their forces for an attack on our fortified position in Kabylia. Our forces are small, outnumbered, and outgunned, but their fighting spirit is fully intact. Although it may take a miracle to hold out against the French, it is a miracle we have been praying for and our soldiers are confident that by God's grace we shall prevail."
 france.202.a: "For liberty!"

 france.203.t: "The French Invasion of Kabylia"
 france.203.d: "A fortified force of around 5,000 Kabyles, natives of the mountainous north of the country, have been holding out in the Kabylia region of the French colony in Algeria for some time now. They have repeatedly posed problems through vigorous resistance against French occupation of their homeland. It seems now that the French are determined to finish off the last pocket of resistance in Algeria. They expect this final conquest of Algeria to be swift, with the resistance in Kabylia supposed to be cleared out in short time."
 france.203.a: "Interesting."

 france.204.t: "French Victory in Kabylia"
 france.204.d: "General Randon's campaign in Kabylia, the last region in Algeria to resist against our colonial expansion, has succeeded.

 france.205.t: "French Victory in Kabylia"

 france.206.t: "Kabylia Natives Stand Firm"
 france.206.d: "In what can only be described as a miraculous turn of circumstances, the Kabyles in Northern Algeria have managed to hold out against the French forces under General Randon. Many wonder whether the General is past his prime or if he is merely being used as a scapegoat for this defeat. This will certainly slow the French designs for the development of the Algerian colony and the Kabylia natives will celebrate this as a great victory for years to come."

 france.211.t: "The Mokrani Revolt"
 france.211.d: "The French control of their colonial territory in Algeria seems to have been recently contested by raids of the local natives. The native population of the Kabylia region in the mountainous north of the country has so far been able to retain their independence, but the French seem determined to put an end to it. Although the struggle isn't a guarenteed victory for the French Empire, the combined efforts of a great power will be tough to match for the native raiders of Kabylia."
 france.211.a: "Let's wait and see what happens."

 france.231.t: "The Siege of Fort Medina"
 france.231.d: "News reached us today from our colony in Senegal of a siege of one of our forts. According to reports, Fort Medina on the bank of the Senegal River was besieged by Toucouleur forces starting in late April of this year. The fort's commander Paul Holle and a short garrison managed to hold off the attacks of the tribal armies. The siege finally broke when governor Louis Faidherbe arrived on a gunboat with reinforcements from the colonial capital. The governor is supposed to be signing an agreement with the leader of the Toucouleur army which should give our colony more breathing room along the Niger River. Many have noted that the bulk of our forces were composed of native soldiers who have proved themselves quite well in battle. Governor Faidherbe has already requested the expansion of the colonial forces in Senegal."

 france.271.a: "Establish a protectorate over Mount Lebanon. This will commit resources but secure influence."

 france.272.t: "An Ultimatum from Paris"
 france.272.d: "France has delivered a clear ultimatum to the Sublime Porte: concede a French protectorate over Mount Lebanon to 'ensure the safety of Christians and French interests' — or face the consequences. The Ottoman cabinet must decide whether to accept and avoid immediate confrontation, or refuse and risk a sharp diplomatic rupture with France."

 france.301.d: "After the capture of Napoleon III at Sedan, the deputies have assembled urgently at Bourbon Palace to decide the fate of the nation. Under the pressure of the crowd gathered in front of the palace, the decision was reached to form a French Republic for the third time in history. A few hours later, the well-known lawyer and politician Léon Gambetta publicly proclaimed the French Republic from the balcony of Paris Town Hall with the following words:\n\n'Frenchmen!

 france.301.a: "Vive la République!"

 france.302.t: "Proclamation of the Third French Republic"
 france.302.d: "After the capture of Napoleon III by German forces at Sedan, French deputies have assembled urgently at Bourbon Palace in Paris to decide the fate of the nation. Under the pressure of the crowd gathered in front of the palace, the decision was reached to form a French Republic for the third time in history.

Citizens, watch over the city which is entrusted to you, tomorrow, along with the army, you shall avenge the nation!.'\nIt seems the French have put their fate in the hands of these men who must now lead their country to victory."
 france.302.a: "Interesting."
 france.302.b: "This might complicate things..."

 france.303.t: "The Establishment of the Government of National Defence under Trochu"
 france.303.d: "To lead the nation against the Prussian invasion, a so-called 'Government of National Defence', lead by General Trochu, has been created to lead our army and our country."
 france.303.a: "We will follow his decisions."

 france.304.t: "Socialist Influence Growing in France"
 france.304.d: "In this troubled period, organizations are forming everywhere in France to support the most disadvantaged among the population. A prime example comes from the capital, where the Republican Central Committee of the Twenty Arrondissements tries to pressure the new government into political and social measures that favour the lower classes."
 france.304.a: "Let's keep an eye on them."

 france.305.t: "The Garde Mobile"
 france.305.d: "The Garde Mobile was intended by the old regime to be the main reserve force of France in case of war. Implemented by law in 1868, the recruits, able-bodied men who had not been drafted prior as well as childless widowers, were supposed to be in service for five years until they left the reserve. During this time, they were supposed to be trained for military combat for two weeks a year.\n\nSince this law has not been fully implemented so far, we will have to live with what we have so far. The recruits are sure to be badly trained and poorly disciplined, many might even have a low fighting spirit, but these men are our last resort..."
 france.305.a: "To arms!"

 france.306.t: "A Diplomatic Mission"
 france.306.d: "Adolphe Thiers has agreed to help the new government in their mission to find diplomatic support among the powers of Europe. He will embark on a journey to the seats of power very soon and we are surely joined by the people of France in wishing him the best of luck. May his experience and reputation help us to fight back against the Germans in these dark times."
 france.306.a: "Hail Monsieur Thiers!"
 FRA_diplomatic_mission_effect_tt: "§YAdolphe Thiers§! will visit the §Ycapitals of the Great Powers of Europe§! over the following weeks."

 france.307.t: "Thiers in London"
 france.307.d: "Adolphe Thiers has arrived in London where he is going to meet the British Foreign Secretary as well as Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader]. Let's hope he can secure British support for our defensive war against the Germans."
 france.307.a: "Good luck!"

 france.308.t: "A Diplomatic Mission from France"
 france.308.d: "After the imperial defeat at the hands of the Germans, the French have recently proclaimed the republic, and they are determined to resist the Prussian advance onto Paris. The well-known French diplomat Adolphe Thiers, who had himself been living in London for a few years back in the 1850s, leads a French diplomatic mission seeking support for the republic's struggle against the Germans.\n\nWhilst we might be sympathetic to their struggle, we cannot join the war on their side. What we could do, however, is to offer them a diplomatic channel for a meeting with the Prussian leadership - and, if we wanted to materialise our moral support, a weapons deal on very favourable terms. Which offer should we make them?"
 france.308.a: "Offer them moral support and a meeting with the Prussians."
 france.308.b: "Offer them weapons and a meeting with the Prussians."

 france.309.t: "Nothing but Sympathy from London"
 france.309.d: "The Thiers mission has reported back to us with bad news from London: the British government are sympathetic to our struggle against the Germans, but they will remain neutral. Thiers has vaguely expressed a diplomatic opportunity offered by the British, but for now we are on our own."
 france.309.a: "Too bad..."

 france.310.t: "An Offer from London"
 france.310.d: "The Thiers mission has reported back to us with mixed news from London: the British government are sympathetic to our struggle against the Germans, but they will remain neutral. They are willing, however, to offer us a weapons deal at very favourable terms to show their support, if we accept of course. Thiers has also vaguely expressed a diplomatic opportunity offered by the British, but for now we seem to be on our own."
 france.310.a: "Accept the weapons deal."
 FRA_weapons_deal_effect_tt: "The weapons are expected to arrive in two weeks."
 france.310.b: "Politely decline their offer."

 france.311.t: "France Accepts Weapons Deal"
 france.311.d: "The French have accepted the weapons deal we offered them. We will prepare the weapons for shipment immediately. Let's hope they can help the French in their struggle against the advancing Germans."
 france.311.a: "Good luck!"

 france.312.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Weapons Arrive"
 france.312.d: "The weapons we ordered from [FROM.GetName] have arrived. Let's hope they will help us in our struggle against the advancing Germans."
 france.312.a: "Good news."

 france.321.t: "The National Assembly Relocates to Bordeaux"
 france.321.d: "The Prussian advance and fear over a lack of legitimacy of an entirely Paris-based provisional government in the eyes of the French public have led the Government of National Defence to relocate the National Assembly further south to Bordeaux. Although the capital still remains in the hands of the government, the situation might worsen over the coming months and to have the assembly securely out of  Prussian reach is a better alternative than to risk a total capture."
 france.321.a: "Alright then."

 france.322.t: "Government Members Dispatched to Tours"
 france.322.d: "Amidst the struggle to resist the Prussian occupation of Paris, to secure support for the provisional government in the French periphery and to organize the recruitment of reserve forces away from the capital, a delegation of government members, including Admiral Fourichon, Alexandre Glais-Bizoin and the Minister of Justice, Adolphe Cremieux, has been sent to Tours to coordinate political and military action in the province."
 france.322.a: "Let's hope they manage to turn the situation around."

 france.323.t: "Léon Gambetta leaves Paris in a balloon"
 france.323.d: "The siege of Paris won't stop our politicians from organizing the rest of the nation! The new Minister of the Interior, the socialist Léon Gambetta, has jumped into a balloon to quit the city. The aim of such a surprising move, is to organize the French Army that are awaiting orders from the government since the start of the siege.\n\nWhat could be seen as an extravagant and excentric way of leaving a city, is in reality probably the best way for him to leave, and to go behind enemy lines. Of course this isn't without risk, but Gambetta is the type of politician that would risk being shot by a Prussian, if it's to save the nation."
 france.323.a: "At least it must be fun"

 france.324.t: "Government delegation captured in Bordeaux !"
 france.324.d: "It's a catastrophe! Without warning, in the middle of the night, the Prusian army made a Perseus in the French defence and entered the city of Bordeaux where the government delegation was now prisoners of the Prussians! The signing of the armistice should be concluded in the afternoon ..."
 france.324.a: "This is the end !"

 france.551.t: "Insurrections in Paris"
 france.551.d: "The siege continues, and the people are getting tired of the poor performance of the newly formed government. A recent streak of military losses, due to a lack of long term planning and quick response tactics, has prompted new insurrections in the capital. Charles Delescluze has called in his newspaper to form the Commune, and to fight against the government.\n\nThis small scale uprising won't topple our government, but it has been the rallying cause for a few of our government members, like Léon Gambetta and Henri Rochefort. Rochefort wants us to accept this uprising as a normal response to a time of crisis, and let them continue. The army however, don't want to deal with internal threats at the same time as the Prussian Army."
 france.551.a: "Send the National Guard to put them down."
 france.551.b: "Leave them be."

 france.552.t: "The National Guard Restores Order in Paris"
 france.552.d: "The National Guard has successfully restored order in Paris. The insurrectionists were unorganized and did not offer much resistance to the advancing troops who were also supported from the inside of the Hôtel de Ville by members of the government. The rebels have been given free passage to leave the city and many of them have done so. Bringing them to justice will have to wait until after the war...\n\nIt has been suggested to hold a plebiscite in Paris to secure the support of the Parisians and to show our enemies that we are firm in our endeavour to defend France and drive the Germans back out of the country. However, a failure to gather enough support could have negative effects as well. What should we do then?"
 france.552.a: "Hold a plebiscite."
 france.552.b: "Not necessary."

 france.554.t: "Léon Gambetta Resigns from Government"
 france.554.d: "Léon Gambetta was one of the strongest opponents of the Paris plebiscite, and now that the government has voiced their full support of it he has deposed his letter of resignation from the French government. He was one of the most charismatic voices of the French Republic and his absence will surely be felt. Now that he's gone, we have to expect furious socialist politicians to oppose the government. Whilst we had hoped that the plebiscite would have a calming effect on the people it might well have the opposite effect..."
 france.554.a: "We shall see."

 france.555.t: "Henri Rochefort Resigns from Government"
 france.555.d: "The passionate Henri Rochefort has deposed his letter of resignation following our order to send the army to pacificy the recent insurrections. Rochefort was a great voice, bridging the gap between the Blanquists and the moderate government. While he often went against some of our republican ideals, he still was an important figure in the formation of the Third French Republic. His sensationalist attitude has made him a volatile minister, and Rochefort's departure will probably not make our job any harder than it already is."
 france.555.a: "Good riddance."

 france.556.t: "Plebiscite Result in Paris: Victory for the Government"
 france.556.d: "The Parisians have spoken! The Government of National Defence obtained a large majority in the vote and will be able to continue the fight!"
 france.556.a: "We will not fail them!"

 france.557.t: "Plebiscite Result in Paris: Defeat for the Government"
 france.557.d: "The Parisians have spoken! The Government of National Defence did not obtain the majority in the vote. General Trochu is expected to decide the fate of the government very soon."
 france.557.a: "Is this the end?"

 france.558.t: "Louis Jules Trochu Steps Down"
 france.558.d: "Another day, another demonstration in Paris. Despite their best efforts, the French have not secured a victory over the German armies yet, and the government continues to refuse the peace terms offered by the Prussians. However, these past few days have been too much for General Trochu.\n\nAfter losing the Paris referendum, Trochu and the Government of National Defence have today announced their resignation. It seems the last united resistantance against the Prussians is now gone, and a new government will soon have to decide on what to do."
 france.558.a: "Looks like it is the end..."

 france.560.t: "Proclamation of the Paris Commune"
 france.560.d: "Disaster! What began as protests by radicals in Paris has escalated into an armed revolt. An attempt by the central government to remove artillery pieces from Paris to be used by the army incited great unrest among the people who feared for the city's defence. Armed soldiers under one of our generals were sent to seize them by force, but a mob made up of civilians and local militia stopped them. The soldiers, deeply infiltrated by radicals, mutinied and took their officers hostage. The unrest is spreading throughout the city with the populace calling for the establishment of a commune organized according to the ideals made popular by Karl Marx."
 france.560.a: "We will crush them!"
 france.560.b: "Vive la Commune!"

 france.561.t: "Proclamation of the Paris Commune"
 france.561.d: "Disaster in the French capital! What began as protests by radicals in Paris has escalated into an armed revolt. An attempt by the central government to remove artillery pieces from Paris to be used by the army incited great unrest among the people who feared for the city's defence. Armed soldiers under command of a French Republican general were sent to seize them by force, but a mob made up of civilians and local militia stopped them. The soldiers, deeply infiltrated by radicals, mutinied and took their officers hostage. The unrest is spreading throughout the city with the populace calling for the establishment of a commune organized according to the ideals made popular by Karl Marx."
 france.561.a: "Putting Marx's words into action, huh?"
 france.561.b: "Will this mean even more trouble for us?"

 france.581.t: "The Savoy Rebellion"
 france.581.d: "The Savoyards have risen against our legal 'reattachement' of Savoy to France. It seems the locals would prefer to remain a part of Italy or even join... Switzerland? Regardless, the rebels have taken the local capital of Chambéry and are arming to defend themselves. We must move and move swiftly, less we be routed a second time by peasants with guns."
 france.581.a: "It seems they won't integrate this easily..."

# 1871 LEGISLATIVE ELECTION

 france.351.t: "First Legislative Election of the Republic"
 france.351.d: "A glorious day for the republic, it's election time! These elections will decide the landscape of our first Parliament, giving an advantage to one of the four major parties present in France and powerful enough to have representatives.\n\nThe Legitimists are the monarchists, supporters of the return to a more classical French monarchy. This party has lots of supporters among the conservative circles, but isn't very popular among the population. The Modérés are, like their name suggest, more moderate conservatives. Supporters of the republic, they still have very conservative views and politics. The Liberals are centrist politicians, who are keen to pleasing everyone. Keeping stability in the new republic might not be a bad idea after all. Finally, the Radicals are socialist poltilicans, pushing for a more centralized economy and for a more welfare-centric nation. Extremly popular, it is also a party that could calm down the recent problems we have with communists insurgencies."
 france.351.a: "It's democracy time."

 france.352.t: "Monarchists won the Election."
 france.352.d: "If the election seemed to oppose Monarchists, composed of the Legitimists, Orléanists and the Napoleonians, and Republicans, it was ultimately aimed at deciding the future of the conflict between pacifist monarchists and Republicans in favor of total war. Exhausted by several long months of conflict, the French finally chose peace."
 france.352.a: "The start of a new era"

 france.353.t: "Adolphe Thiers elected President"

dynmod_FRA_imperial_army_desc: "The Army of Victory resides in France. It is the best in Europe, in the world! It's leader, the brave Emperor Napoleon, has given unto his army laurel after laurel, in all the corners of the world. From Algeria, to Crimea, to Italy and to Asia. The Imperial Army is the strongest of all! While the Imperial armoury can at times lack by a few years, the training provided to the Imperial Army is immaculate. The officer corps is the most veteran of all, and is honed through regular deployments to Algeria. Every officer who wants a good career, first tastes the merciless steel and powder of an Arab guerrilla. Then, he can face the fine lines of a European army, for he has seen much worse and is ready for much worse. Others, find homes in the Imperial foreign legion, which takes all the misfits of the world and turns them into patriotic Frenchmen, loyal to the Emperor and their legionary brothers unto death. Then of course, there are the Generals, similarly so some of the best. Who but Bazaine could lay claim to be the best cavalryman in Europe? Who but MacMahon could lay claim to lead the best infantry in Europe? None! Now naturally, pride is the death of victory, but the French Empire has earned it's pride, and it will continue to earn it for a long time. Vive l'Empire!"

dynmod_FRA_imperial_navy: "La Grande Marine"
dynmod_FRA_imperial_navy_desc: "The first Napoleon had the grand Army...Napoleon III, has the grand navy. Napoleon III has since his ascent to the presidency, and then throne, practically doubled the budget of the navy. He has also nearly doubled the number of effective sailors in the Navy. From some twenty thousand sailors, to almost forty thousand sailors. From some one hundred million Francs, to two hundred million Francs. A budget so large, even Britain's is starting to be caught up to. Now, while the dream of reaching Britain's ship count is questionable, due to Britain's large number of transport and supply ships relevant to their Empire; the Emperor has managed to parry them in the number of combatant ships. Over a hundred vessels sit just in the internal sea {Mediterranean}, defying every single navy in the area. The Italians can weep, Spanish cry, Ottomans wail; but the French Navy will always prevail. Now, why has the Emperor done this, now that he has Britain's friendship? The reason is rather simple, as the Russians say - Trust but verify. And apart from that, the Emperor has designs of Empire, if not always in Europe, then on other continents, and when someone has to blow things up who better than a ship with three hundred guns and explosive shells? As such, so long as the Emperor remains, so too will the Grand Navy."

FRA_empire_autoritaire: "L'Empire Autoritaire"
FRA_empire_autoritaire_desc: "His Majesty, the Emperor Napoleon III, runs a very tight ship. First as President and then as Emperor, the person of his majesty rarely shied away from decisive and often bloody measures to bring about political and social goals. This has not stopped, and continues to define the political landscape of the Empire. However, unlike in most authoritarian regimes, this has not brought about general suffering or mass surveillance for the purposes of bad ends. Rather however, it has resulted in a nation which is advancing in all aspects with rapid pace and ambition to overcome the entire continent! Within just the past decade, over 3,000 Kilometers of railways have been constructed. Several conflicts started either against or by the Empire have been won. Rights of the fairer sex, ignored or even crushed at times, now make great strides under the advice of Empress Eugenie and the personal interest of Emperor Napoleon III. The rights of the workers have also advanced, and the economic golden age as described by some is just getting started. Over a thousand banks have been opened up just by the current point, and the Authoritarian Empire with it's strong hold, seems to be pushing for even more. Naturally, this has come at the cost of certain political freedoms and the presence of the Gendarmerie Imperiale is undeniable. . .but, for the common Frenchman, this is a fine enough state. For if the Emperor will make France the only place where the right to eat is assured, the freedom to read is not needed."

FRA_laurier_victoire: "Laurier de la Victoire"
FRA_laurier_victoire_desc: "The French Empire's tricolor waves proudly across the world. The British, so arrogant, have grown to fear and respect the Emperor. The Russians have been struck down in the Crimean War and the petty Sultan of the Mohammedan faith understands who his superior is. The ones in Egypt stand ready, for the Emperor and his architects inquire most soundly unto a canal to bridge the seas. In Italy, the enemies of His Holiness and by proxy his most Imperial Majesty, lay dead and defeated. The French Empire shall be rivaled by none! This all has naturally led to a lot of good things in the fatherland. Trade flows from almost all corners of the globe, just as Faidhbere predicted it would. In the east, the peoples of the Balkans and of Poland look to us, rather than others, for guidance and liberation. And so, our influence spans Europe indirectly if not directly. The common man can read almost monthly, of our great victories occurring either now, or rarely more than two years in the past. And mothers can dream, that their child too shall earn the legion of honor for the Empire of a century grand. Vive l'Empire! Vive l'Armee! Vive la France!"

FRA_economie_liberale_projets_imperiaux: "Économie Libérale et Projets Impériaux"
FRA_economie_liberale_projets_imperiaux_desc: "His Majesty has always had a self-contradictory economic and national policy. He is a 'Conservative Emperor' who advances women and social rights. He is a revolutionary who uses grapeshot on his former Italian allies. He is an infantryman, who designs artillery. He is a Monarch, who creates plans for civilian stoves. And this trend of doing what he usually should not, extends to economics too. His Majesty has been a massive supporter of liberal trade ideals. Low tariffs, low inquiry and other such things. On the other hand, he has been the most vigorous of builders, designers and planners. It is he who orders Haussmann to review prefectures and add to them various places of interest. It is he who continually bludgeons the rich with protections of the worker. And yet it is also he who slashes taxes to all within the nation, and the one who lets the British and Spanish trade on equal footing with the French. This has sadly, created some problems. The Imperial economy is heavily reliant on her colonies, which deliver to the Empire resources which are then sold and made profit off. Furthermore, the Emperor's policies while successful at making life 'wonderful' for most, has not granted unto the Empire mass-industrialization as he had wished. As such, until either he begins to construct state-owned factories to outpace Britain, or regulation goes down so much that the British practices come to France, the Empire will have a rather problematic budget to deal with."

FRA_la_lumiere_directrice: "La Lumière Directrice"
FRA_la_lumiere_directrice_desc: "Napoleon III, is the guiding light of the Empire. Without him, there would be no Empire, perhaps even no Republic back in 1848. Without him, the woman would still have no hope of studying, and the Algerians would be gassed daily by the King's troops. This creates an extreme problem for the Empire however. While the Emperor is healthy and agile, the Eagle is sure to soar over the entire world. But when His Majesty is sick, unable to rule or give his own commands. . .then the Empire is left without it's head, and the many forces united behind the Emperor begin to squabble. The Empire has it's Alexander, it's Ceasar, it's Augustus or rather fittingly - it's Napoleon. But what will the Empire do without him? The Empire thus has a ticking clock, to which is tied a dagger right above it's head. Some solution must be found. Perhaps the solution is to ensure that His Majesty is not the biggest cog of the machine? Perhaps it is to ensure that only the Emperor's firmest remain? Maybe, a grand system of checks and balances to oversee all? Whatever it may be, a decision must be made. For god help us if the clock strikes twelve, and the Emperor is not there."
