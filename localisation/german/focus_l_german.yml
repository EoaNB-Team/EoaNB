If we are to implement his turrets onto our actual warships, some design tweaks have to be made. Despite this, the turrets have great potential ahead if implemented correctly."
 ENG_focus_ericsson_turrets: "Ericsson's Turrets"
 ENG_focus_ericsson_turrets_desc: "Ericsson made a good show of his turrets in their action aboard the USS Monitor in the US Civil War. Unlike Coles' turrets these are already designed for, and fitted to, regular warships. They are simpler and less reliable, but they have shown to function well-enough in battle."
 ENG_focus_watts_machines: "Watts' Machines"
 ENG_focus_watts_machines_desc: "Watts favours light hulls with good speed in his ships, and get that speed he has deviced an improved steam engine that can handle greater pressures than ever before. With the use of improved boilers and more effective steam usage by better design, these engines can produce power that propell our ships quickly!"
 ENG_focus_robinson_hulls: "Robinson's Hulls"
 ENG_focus_robinson_hulls_desc: "Robinson's armored hull designs are slightly slower than regular ships, but are more heavily armored and armed. Using clever distribution of iron and brass plates, these armor designs can protect the ship and her crew from most shell types of the day while firing back with impunity."

VEN_focus_the_state_of_venezuela:0 "El Estado de Venezuela"
VEN_focus_the_state_of_venezuela_desc:0 "One of the countries who separated from La Gran Colombia, the bastion of freedom for Hispanic America, and the country where the famous liberator Simón Bolívar was born in, Venezuela stands as one of the multiple countries of South America. Arriving as the leader of Venezuela will not be a particularly easy task, and in order to be able to lead a country, one must know the current state of it. The people of Venezuela are eager to know what your next move will be, and you shall not keep them waiting. Long live Venezuela!"
VEN_focus_monagas_legacy:0 "Continue Monagas' Legacy"
VEN_focus_monagas_legacy_desc:0 "The Monagas brothers have been in the presidency for a total of 10 years. Once the period of government of José Gregorio Monagas, who was in power after José Tadeo Monagas, ended, his brother returned to power for the second time. Who knows what other things he will do?"
VEN_telegraph_service:0 "Telegraph Service of Venezuela"
VEN_telegraph_service_desc:0 "The first telegraph line that has operated in Venezuela, which connects the city of Caracas with La Guaira, has been put into operation. Its promoter was the Spaniard Manuel de Montúfar, who requested authorization from the government to execute the project. A new era for Venezuela!"
VEN_censor_the_press:0 "Censor the Press"
VEN_censor_the_press_desc:0 "Although our intention is to lead the nation to greatness, the press does not think the same. Every day more criticism. The people are changing their opinion about the government. This must stop now."
VEN_conservative_persecution:0 "Conservative Persecution"
VEN_conservative_persecution_desc:0 "Conservatives had been governing Venezuela for a very long time until the Liberals took power. Even though it has already been defined that we have the people on our side, the Conservatives want to take back their power. We must put a stop to this before it escalates."
VEN_prohibit_slave_keeping:0 "Prohibit the Slave Keeping"
VEN_prohibit_slave_keeping_desc:0 "Even though President José Gregorio Monagas previously abolished slavery, many people still keep slaves on their haciendas. Due to them being forever in debt, they cannot get their freedom from their master. We should make all slaves free immediately."
VEN_constitution_1857:0 "The Constitution of 1857"
VEN_constitution_1857_desc:0 "The president is seen as nothing more than a clown by the Venezuelan people. Those who really govern in Venezuela are the military and the caudillos. We should give more legislative power to the president and take it away from the governors. What could go wrong?"
VEN_end_political_abuse:0 "End the Political Abuse"
VEN_end_political_abuse_desc:0 "For too long have we abused our power. Nepotism is common and corruption abounds in our government and administration. Ceasing these activities is the path to greatness."
VEN_conservative_revolution:0 "The Conservative Revolution"
VEN_conservative_revolution_desc:0 "Political sectarianism, high corruption, mismanagement of public finances and lack of government concern. The consequences have been extreme political violence and great social chaos. The Venezuelans are tired and ready to rise up. The people united will never be defeated!"
VEN_supress_people:0 "Suppress the People"
VEN_supress_people_desc:0 "An increase in the discontent of the population has been noted. It seems that if we don't act soon, there will be a revolt and they will topple our government. Perhaps with discipline, people will drop these absurd ideas. We must do something before it's too late!"
VEN_constitution_1858:0 "The Constitution of 1858"
VEN_constitution_1858_desc:0 "It is time to change the way elections are made. The people must have the right to vote for their president and vice president. Perhaps we should give more autonomy to each province as well. This should lower the people's discontent, right?"
VEN_castros_victory:0 "Castro's Victory"
VEN_castros_victory_desc:0 "As expected, Julián Castro's revolution has been victorious for the conservatives. The Partido Conservador has once again taken power. What will become of Venezuela?"
VEN_march_revolution_fails:0 "The Revolution Fails"
VEN_march_revolution_fails_desc:0 "To everyone's surprise, the government managed to repel the enemy and secure the territory. Opposing forces have been defended, eventually with a retreat. The people responsible for this revolt will be punished. The Liberal government remains in control."
VEN_jc_caudillos_situation:0 "The Caudillos Situation"
VEN_jc_caudillos_situation_desc:0 "The caudillos have reached the point of being an important part of our nation. Former military leaders who forcibly seized power over various lands, whose authority is only guaranteed by military men who are loyal to them, have co-existed with our government for a long time. We must decide what to do with them as the first action of our government."
VEN_jc_exile_caudillos:0 "Exile the Caudillos"
VEN_jc_exile_caudillos_desc:0 "After consideration, we have decided that the caudillos cannot remain in power for another second. They must be exiled from the country. Wherever they go except here. In this way, we get rid of one less problem."
VEN_jc_peace_caudillos:0 "Peace with the Caudillos"
VEN_jc_peace_caudillos_desc:0 "We have come to the decision that exiling the caudillos is very risky and could spark rebellions. Better to leave them alone, for now. However, this does not mean that they will always be in power. We'll keep a close eye on them."
VEN_fate_of_monagas:0 "The Fate of Monagas"
VEN_fate_of_monagas_desc:0 "After forcing José Tadeo Monagas to abdicate, he has taken refuge in the French Legation in Caracas. People are asking for something to be done with it. Because of this, we have to come to a conclusion."
VEN_paez_takes_power:0 "Páez Takes Power"
VEN_paez_takes_power_desc:0 "The liberal government has ruled for a long time already in Venezuela. It is time for the conservatives to establish order and take power once again. Former President José Antonio Páez will once more launch a coup d'état against José Tadeo Monagas, just like several years ago. This is not over!"
VEN_gual_escandon_remains:0 "Gual Escandón Remains"
VEN_gual_escandon_remains_desc:0 "After the failed revolution of Julián Castro, the country must decide who will be the successor of José Tadeo Monagas. The most obvious choice is Gual Escandón, the president who lasted three days in power before the revolution. Let's hope he leads Venezuela to greatness!"
VEN_ge_political_reform:0 "Political Reform"
VEN_ge_political_reform_desc:0 "First things first, the current government must be fixed, which is a disaster. A political reform should lead us to improve the administration of Venezuela."
VEN_ge_start_the_revamp:0 "Start the Revamp"
VEN_ge_start_the_revamp_desc:0 "Thanks to the reforms made, we can begin to take Venezuela to the nation that we all desire. It is time to carry out the reforms. However, first we will have to make a plan of what we are going to do."
VEN_ge_diplomatic_effort:0 "Diplomatic Effort"
VEN_ge_diplomatic_effort:0 "Now that we have managed to maintain a more competent administration of the country, the next step is the other countries. By maintaining our relations with other countries, we guarantee a better position in the world and the chances of aggressiveness towards us decrease. We need good relations with the powerful nations."
VEN_ge_relations_ven_neighbors:0 "Relations with Our Neighbors"
VEN_ge_relations_ven_neighbors_desc:0 "Maintaining good relations with the countries around us is extremely important. Not only does it make it much less likely that they will show hostility towards us, but they also facilitate meetings between our leaders and the transportation of goods overland."
VEN_ge_neutrality_pact:0 "Neutrality Pact"
VEN_ge_neutrality_pact_desc:0 "In an approach to diplomacy to guarantee good relations with other countries, we have decided that having non-aggression pacts with our neighbors is what should be done. In this way, we guarantee other countries that we have no intention of being hostile."
VEN_ge_restore_economy:0 "Restore the Economy"
VEN_ge_restore_economy_desc:0 "Our country has been submerged in many economic crises over the years. This needs to be fixed as soon as possible. Of course, better sooner than later. By taking the necessary steps to remedy the economic crisis affecting our country right now, we will also help prevent possible economic crises in the future."
VEN_ge_reshape_military:0 "Reshape the Military"
VEN_ge_reshape_military_desc:0 "Corruption abounds not only in government, but also in our military. This must stop now. By making various reforms, our army will become stable again."
VEN_ge_eradicate_corruption:0 "Eradicate the Corruption"
VEN_ge_eradicate_corruption_desc:0 "As the final step of our reforms, the last thing is to completely eradicate corruption from the nation of Venezuela. By doing this, we will be well on our way to being a great nation. A nation that many would envy, that many would try to replicate, but few would succeed."
VEN_ge_expand_military_staff:0 "Expand the Military Staff"
VEN_ge_expand_military_staff_desc:0 "Now that we have completed the desired reforms for the military, we will be able to expand the personnel serving our country. In this way, national security will be increased considerably, as well as we will impose our authority on the people."
VEN_ge_demilitarize_nation:0 "Demilitarize the Nation"
VEN_ge_demilitarize_nation_desc:0 "After implementing the reforms to the army, it has been seriously considered that finally, we should demilitarize Venezuela. The policemen will be in charge of the previous responsibilities of the army. This decision will make us show people that we have mutual trust so that people will support our government even more."
VEN_ge_strike_the_british_deal:0 "The Esequibo Treaty"
VEN_ge_strike_the_british_deal_desc:0 "One of President Gual Escandón's plans previously was to make a deal with the British and cede the Essequibo territory to Guyana. However, Páez rejected such a proposal. Now that Gual Escandón has come to power, he has the option to do as he wished. The British will help us in various advisory and economic aspects in exchange for the specified territories."
VEN_ge_a_reformed_venezuela:0 "A Reformed Venezuela"
VEN_ge_a_reformed_venezuela_desc:0 "The first thing that had to be done has been done. Now is the time for Venezuela to flourish as we please. It is time for a reformed Venezuela under the leadership of the Conservative Party. Long live Gual Escandón!"
VEN_ge_the_caudillo_rebellion:0 "The Caudillo Rebellion"
VEN_ge_the_caudillo_rebellion_desc:0 "Demilitarizing the nation has brought up issues with the caudillos. As their authority was only upheld by the army, the reforms for the military have not done more than weaken their power. If we are not smart, the caudillos will rebel against us."
VEN_con_puppet_regime:0 "Install A Puppet Regime"
VEN_con_puppet_regime_desc:0 "As has been done previously, installing a puppet government is the best option that suits us best. Thus, our puppet will do all the dirty work while we still rule Venezuela. It has worked before and it will work now."
VEN_con_paez_take_responsbility:0 "Take Responsibility"
VEN_con_paez_take_responsbility_desc:0 "It is time to change our methods. It has been shown that installing a puppet regime will not work and eventually they will rebel, as in the case of Monagas. This time José Antonio Páez will assume complete control of Venezuela."
VEN_con_economic_crisis:0 "Remedy the Economic Crisis"
VEN_con_economic_crisis_desc:0 "Unfortunately, when you take power in a nation, you have to clean up the mess of the previous government. The Liberals did nothing but worsen our economic situation. It is our duty as the new government to fix this immediately with the necessary measures at all costs."
VEN_con_private_property:0 "Endorse Private Property"
VEN_con_private_property_desc:0 "The right of all individuals to the possession, control and disposal of a good is necessary. In a society without private property, no one can sell anything without being punished, just as everything is owned by the state and no one has the right to own anything. How absurd! We must defend this human right and promote it to the people of Venezuela."
VEN_con_defense_legal_order:0 "Defense of the Legal Order"
VEN_con_defense_legal_order_desc:0 "As the political party, it is our duty to uphold the old laws. This includes defending them at all costs. The legal order that had been established in Venezuela many years ago is increasingly ignored. The order must be established again."
VEN_con_return_social_order:0 "Return of the Old Social Order"
VEN_con_return_social_order_desc:0 "It is our duty as the government of Venezuela to preserve the legacy of the nation. The old social order in Venezuela was a vital part of Venezuelan society. We should bring the old traditions back. After all, a nation is nothing without its culture."
VEN_con_fight_lib_guerrillas:0 "Fight the Liberal Guerrillas"
VEN_con_fight_lib_guerrillas_desc:0 "Although we have rightfully claimed our place as a legitimate government, many liberals have disagreed. After the conservatives returned to power, there have been many liberal guerrillas scattered throughout the country. We must find and exterminate these terrorist groups."
VEN_con_authority_over_population:0 "Authority Over the Population"
VEN_con_authority_over_population_desc:0 "Venezuela has always suffered from instability and insecurity. By ruling over the nation with an iron fist, the people will be demotivated and the revolutions on their part will drop by a great deal. Fear is a great weapon that must be used with care, and that is what we are going to do."
VEN_jtm_handle_economic_crisis:0 "Handle Economic Crisis"
VEN_jtm_handle_economic_crisis_desc:0 "We have witnessed the decline of our economy for a long time. Because the price of our imports has dropped massively, we have nothing to stabilize our economy. It is time to start looking for a solution to the crisis."
VEN_jtm_organize_nation:0 "Organize the Nation"
VEN_jtm_organize_nation_desc:0 "With the primary problems of Venezuela out of our way, it is time to organize the nation as such. Right now, it's a mess, which gets in the way too much. We must continue to carry out our reforms."
VEN_jtm_restructure_administration:0 "Restructure the Administration"
VEN_jtm_restructure_administration_desc:0 "The first step we must take is in the government itself. There is a lot of corruption, nepotism and others. We will have to apply the necessary measures to make this stop. A competent government is what is needed for Venezuela."
VEN_jtm_revision_laws:0 "Revision of Laws"
VEN_jtm_revision_laws_desc:0 "Our laws at this time greatly limit the potential of Venezuela. If we want to progress as a nation, we have to make several modifications to the laws imposed by previous governments."
VEN_jtm_propose_the_changes:0 "Propose the Changes"
VEN_jtm_propose_the_changes_desc:0 "We have decided what we are going to do. However, the last thing remains, which is to propose the changes to the rest of the officials. When they are approved, we can begin to change the laws."
VEN_jtm_raise_infrastructure_maintenance:0 "Raise Infrastructure Maintenance"
VEN_jtm_raise_infrastructure_maintenance_desc:0 "One of Venezuela's problems is that, compared to the other countries in the world, we are extremely behind. Our cities and towns are separate and there is no way to connect them with the amount of maintenance that our infrastructure has. We have to raise expenses to improve it."
VEN_jtm_prohibit_child_labor:0 "Prohibit Child Labor"
VEN_jtm_prohibit_child_labor_desc:0 "Child labor is a highly immoral thing. Subjecting such pure beings to do such heavy work should be illegal. Instead, we have to start industrializing the country to free these poor little boys."
VEN_jtm_appoint_new_ministers:0 "Appoint New Ministers"
VEN_jtm_appoint_new_ministers_desc:0 "Our administration includes the ministers in charge of the parts of our government. Until now, such charges were riddled with corruption by being free ranked. This will change. We will put the right people for the job."
VEN_jtm_new_health_programs:0 "New Health Programs"
VEN_jtm_new_health_programs_desc:0 "Venezuela is sunk in misery with diseases everywhere. We have to fix this and care for our people. By having new healthcare programs, we will be able to improve living conditions in the country. In addition, we will win the support of the Venezuelan people."
VEN_jtm_new_education_plan:0 "New Education Plan"
VEN_jtm_new_education_plan_desc:0 "Many people in the country are woefully illiterate. Only the rich and oligarchs have access to education. By having a new education plan, this could change. The people will thank us."
VEN_jtm_new_financial_scheme:0 "New Financial Scheme"
VEN_jtm_new_financial_scheme_desc:0 "If there is one thing that the recent economic crisis has taught us, it is that we cannot trust the economic plan that we have at the moment. We need to draft a new financial scheme in order to improve our economy and thus not have such serious economic crises."
VEN_jtm_the_caudillos_situation:0 "The Caudillos Situation"
VEN_jtm_the_caudillos_situation_desc:0 "Venezuela's biggest problem is its general instability. The caudillos contribute in large part to the problems of today in Venezuela. With the caudillos gone, we will be able to fix many more problems. We have to solve the current situation."
VEN_jtm_conduct_military_reforms:0 "Conduct Military Reforms"
VEN_jtm_conduct_military_reforms_desc:0 "The Venezuelan army is nothing more than the disorganized armies of the caudillos. There is really no national militia as it is known. We have to carry out reforms to the army to have enough armed forces when the right time comes."
VEN_jtm_write_a_constitution:0 "Write a Constitution"
VEN_jtm_write_a_constitution_desc:0 "The last step to get rid of the caudillos is to consume all the power they have in order to weaken them and make them easier to destroy. We will also have to form the national army officially, which we will achieve thanks to a new constitution. The war is coming."
VEN_jtm_fight_the_caudillos:0 "Fight the Caudillos"
VEN_jtm_fight_the_caudillos_desc:0 "The plan was previously to exile them, but they will come back stronger and will overthrow us. The only way to get rid of the caudillos is to destroy them and kill anyone who supports them. The fight will be long, but it will be worth it. Glory to Venezuela!"
VEN_jtm_the_new_venezuela:0 "The New Venezuela"
VEN_jtm_the_new_venezuela_desc:0 "The hard part is over. We have brought social, political and general stability to Venezuela. With the caudillos no longer a hindrance, the new laws and the reforms to the country, we are ready to carry out our plan. It is time to make Venezuela a great country. Long live the United States of Venezuela!"
VEN_jtm_free_politics:0 "Free Politics"
VEN_jtm_free_politics_desc:0 "Although we do not like it, it is necessary for progress. We have to open up and become a democracy without any censorship from any political party. It could have negative effects, but in the long run it will benefit us."
VEN_jtm_make_the_preparations:0 "Make the Preparations"
VEN_jtm_make_the_preparations_desc:0 "Preparing ourselves and striking first is the most convenient option. If the caudillos notice we're making reforms, they'll know we are going to attack them. However, working silently and rapidly will catch them by surprise and we will have a better chance of winning."
VEN_jtm_declare_the_usv:0 "Declare the United States of Venezuela"
VEN_jtm_declare_the_usv_desc:0 "We will need to set a before and after in the era of the caudillos. The State of Venezuela will become an obsolete nickname for our nation.

VEN_con_revert_lib_changes:0 "Revert Liberal Changes"
VEN_con_revert_lib_changes_desc:0 "As the new government, we must clean up the mess the Liberals made previously.

This is the first step in bringing Venezuela back to greatness!"
VEN_con_keep_slavery:0 "Keep Slavery"
VEN_con_keep_slavery_desc:0 "One of the things we defend is slavery. By preserving the old Venezuela, we must also preserve its customs and traditions. This includes keeping up with the slaves. We must bring her back. Shame on the liberals!"
VEN_con_lib_persecution:0 "Liberal Persecution"
VEN_con_lib_persecution_desc:0 "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. When the Liberals were in power, poor fellow Conservatives were persecuted, jailed, and even killed. We should give liberals a taste of their own medicine. Maybe that will calm them down a bit."
VEN_con_expand_military:0 "Expand the Military"
VEN_con_expand_military_desc:0 "One of the problems that still needs to be solved is our military. The militia as such does not exist, our authority is sustained by the caudillos. We must expand Venezuela's armed forces to follow our orders and ours alone. We must keep order!"
VEN_con_kill_opposition_leaders:0 "Kill Opposition Leaders"
VEN_con_kill_opposition_leaders_desc:0 "As a measure to eliminate liberalism from Venezuela once and for all, we must assassinate the political leaders of the party. This way, the Liberals will be disorganized and won't know who to follow, essentially throwing them into chaos and hopefully disbanding the party for good."
VEN_con_the_old_ways:0 "The Old Ways"
VEN_con_the_old_ways_desc:0 "The old days, how nostalgic! As the Conservative Party, we must bring the old ways and uphold them. The people will be grateful to be able to be part of and witness the true Venezuelan culture."
VEN_con_police_state:0 "Police State"
VEN_con_police_state_desc:0 "The order has a cost. So that Venezuela does not fall into chaos and anarchy, we must ensure social and national security. Even if this will not satisfy our people, it must be done. For now, and hopefully temporarily, we will establish a police state to maintain order. For Venezuela!"
VEN_con_complete_censorship:0 "Complete Censorship"
VEN_con_complete_censorship_desc:0 "To ensure that the Conservative government stays in power and the Liberals don't take it back, we must start censoring the population. No one will be against our government. Thanks to this there will be prosperity in Venezuela and we will not have to worry about the opposition."
VEN_con_establish_secret_police:0 "Establish a Secret Police"
VEN_con_libertad:0 "Libertad!"
VEN_con_libertad_desc:0 "We have finally reached the point of making Venezuela a country free from liberal changes and we have transformed it into the conservative dream. From now on Venezuela will be ours and we will be able to progress as a nation. Glory to Venezuela!"
VEN_con_popularize_government_ideas:0 "Popularize Government Ideas"
VEN_con_popularize_government_ideas_desc:0 "The government is nothing without the support of the people. We have to publicize and popularize the ideas that we want to impose in Venezuela. The pople need to support us in order to live in coexistence."
VEN_con_promote_meritocratic_system:0 "Promote the Meritocratic System"
VEN_con_promote_meritocratic_system_desc:0 "We must convince the population of Venezuela that everything can be achieved with merit.
