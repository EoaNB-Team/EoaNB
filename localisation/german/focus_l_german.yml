The Royal Navy must stand ever vigilant to defend the shores of Britain!"
 ENG_focus_steam_engine: "Steam Engine"
 ENG_focus_steam_engine_desc: "The Steam Engine over the past two decades has proved to be an effective and practical machine with many uses. The implementation of these engines into our warships would allow for propulsion without sails and wind; a concept that could very well revolutionize the manner of fighting at sea!\n\nThe idea isn't new, but the implications of this development could be decisive for our future engagements."
 ENG_focus_go_with_walker: "Go with Walker"
 ENG_focus_go_with_walker_desc: "Sir Baldwin W. Walker, our Surveyour of the Navy, has over his career overseen the construction of multiple wooden-hulled heavy frigates fitted with powerful engines for maximum manoeverability. His ideas are however a bit outdated, believeing steadfast that wooden hulls will not be able to be replaced by iron hulls. His newest design, while powerful, lacks some newer finesses of naval engineering. Nonetheless, he pushes forward. Should we heed his ideas?"
 ENG_focus_mark_cannon: "Mark Cannon"
 ENG_focus_mark_cannon_desc: "The rise of armored hulls that are impervious to common cast shot has led to somewhat of a crisis in naval gunnery. The recent trends have had ramming be the go-to attack against armored ships, but a recent development in the 'Mark Cannon' has finally allowed for the ability to deal with armored ships at a safer distance.\n\nIt's critical we push ahead with these guns immediately, lest we be pushed out of the oceans!"
 ENG_focus_armstrong_cannon: "Armstrong Cannon"
 ENG_focus_armstrong_cannon_desc: "Our war-time experiences from the Crimean War have shown that British guns in stock are severely outdated, some being built as far back as the Napoleonic Wars. This cannot stand, for neither the Army or the Navy! We've established a commission for a new gun-design to replace our current fleet of guns. One commission provider, Sir William Armstrong, has proposed ideas of a breach-loading gun. Should we give him the contract?"
 ENG_focus_commision_monitors: "Commision Monitors"
 ENG_focus_commision_monitors_desc: "The USS Monitor design by John Ericsson for the Union Navy has seen the implementation of interesting characteristics not found in our current fleet. The ship's hull is low in the water, and fully constructed of metal armor. It is without masts, fully engine-powered and fashions a single armored gun turret.\n\nThe ship's successful usage against the CSA Navy makes developing some ships of our own an appealing prospect..."
 ENG_focus_commision_ironside_frigates: "Commision Ironside Frigates"
 ENG_focus_commision_ironside_frigates_desc: "The implementation of armored plating onto our warships must not only happen for our greater warships! We must also make an effort to add armor to our frigates aswell. The added armor will make them more resistant to enemy fire, as wooden hulls are no longer viable due to being easily damaged by gunfire."
 ENG_focus_new_ships: "New ships"
 ENG_focus_new_ships_desc: "While the development of guns, armor and propulsion is certainly important, we must not forget to also look into how to best incorporate them into our ships! New ship designs, incorporating the newest inventions and discoveries of naval engineering, must be developed as to best make effective use of our new technology."
 ENG_focus_newer_engines: "New engines"
 ENG_focus_newer_engines_desc: "The steam engine has proven to be a valuable asset in naval propulsion, but has some clear shortcomings aswell. The space required for housing the engines is great, and the pressure that these engines can handle is still not sufficient for greater speeds. We must look into improving these engines, as to make them more reliable, smaller and more powerful."
 ENG_focus_listen_to_coles: "Listen to Coles"
 ENG_focus_listen_to_coles_desc: "Coles was the one who introduced us first to the abilities of the gun turret, and his design was proven to be feasible at the siege of Taganrog. His design is more technologically advanced than that of Ericsson's, though perhaps the simplicity of Ericsson's design is what we need instead?"
 #ENG_focus_ericsson_is_right: "Ericsson is right"
 #ENG_focus_ericsson_is_right_desc: "John Ericsson, the designer of the USS Monitor and a rival contender for the gun turret patent, has extensive practical experience with building ships with these turrets. His design is simpler than that of Coles, but lacks some sophistication. Ericsson's design is sound, but perhaps Coles' iteration of the idea is better suited for our needs?"

 #ENG_focus_listen_to_robinson: "Listen to Robinson"
 ENG_focus_coles_turrets: "Coles' Turrets"
 ENG_focus_coles_turrets_desc: "We know Coles' gun turret design first-hand from his actions in the Crimean War. They have proven to be effective when used, but only on a small raft. If we are to implement his turrets onto our actual warships, some design tweaks have to be made. Despite this, the turrets have great potential ahead if implemented correctly."
 ENG_focus_ericsson_turrets: "Ericsson's Turrets"
 ENG_focus_ericsson_turrets_desc: "Ericsson made a good show of his turrets in their action aboard the USS Monitor in the US Civil War. Unlike Coles' turrets these are already designed for, and fitted to, regular warships. They are simpler and less reliable, but they have shown to function well-enough in battle."
 ENG_focus_watts_machines: "Watts' Machines"
 ENG_focus_watts_machines_desc: "Watts favours light hulls with good speed in his ships, and get that speed he has deviced an improved steam engine that can handle greater pressures than ever before. With the use of improved boilers and more effective steam usage by better design, these engines can produce power that propell our ships quickly!"
 ENG_focus_robinson_hulls: "Robinson's Hulls"
 ENG_focus_robinson_hulls_desc: "Robinson's armored hull designs are slightly slower than regular ships, but are more heavily armored and armed. Using clever distribution of iron and brass plates, these armor designs can protect the ship and her crew from most shell types of the day while firing back with impunity."
