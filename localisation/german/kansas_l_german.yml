 ##Events
 
 kansas_election.1.t:0 "Robinson's History Uncovered"
 kansas_election.1.desc:0 "Charles Lawrence Robinson, one of the popular candidates in the upcoming election, appears to have quite a controversial history. According to our reports, he has participated in riots uring his time in California, and is alleged to have commited murder. This may hurt his political carrier if it gets out, but should we risk our public view?"
 kansas_election.1.a:0 "There's no need to"
 kansas_election.1.b:0 "Release the reports"
 kansas_election.2.t:0 "State Visit to Lawrence"
 kansas_election.2.desc:0 "Lawrence is one of the most successful settler cities in Kansas, and, as its founder, Charles Lawrence Robinson, one of the candidates in the upcoming election, resides in it. As a move to gain support, we could do a state visit to that town, but that'll also bring attention to the candidate."
 kansas_election.2.a:0 "This is a sufficient trade-off"
 kansas_election.2.b:0 "It is too risky"
 kansas_election.3.t:0 "Raid on Lawrence"
 kansas_election.3.desc:0 "Lawrence is the centre of the Charles Lawrence Robinson's election campaign and of the anti-slavery movement in Kansas, so it was shocking news when it got raided by pro-slavery forces. We could invest into reconstruction of the damage, as this is a major settlement, and such damage can't go unnoticed."
 kansas_election.3.a:0 "Lawrence must be recovered"
 kansas_election.3.b:0 "Leave them to fit it themselves"
 kansas_election.4.t:0 "[GetBrown]'s anti-slavery raids"
 kansas_election.4.desc:0 "As [GetBrown] is gaining popularity, it is difficult to ignore him. A government official is planning to do a speech on the organised raid on Harpers Ferry, praising him as a hero. As it has resulted in treason charges on multiple participants, it is a controversial topic, and we could hamper his election choice by painting the raid as treasonous."
 kansas_election.4.a:0 "His accomplishments are truly heroic."
 kansas_election.4.b:0 "The raids were nothing but treason."
 kansas_election.5.t:0 "Brown's Lack of Pacifism"
 kansas_election.5.desc:0 "[GetBrown]'s popularity is shocking, as he is not a pacifist figure whatsoever. A president should not be a warmonger, especially in the fragile situation our country is in, surrounded by stronger powers. However, such a president can inspire the populace to fiercely fight for the Kansan independence, so it's a difficult question on whether his lack of pacifism should be praised or condemned."
 kansas_election.5.a:0 "Our country must remain independent"
 kansas_election.5.b:0 "Condemn his lack of diplomacy"
 kansas_election.6.t:0 "[GetBrown]'s involvement in Pottawatomie massacre"
 kansas_election.6.desc:0 "Pottawatomie Massacre was a massacre of several slavery owners in Franklin Country in May 1856, and [GetBrown] was one of its participants. The massacre has started the period known as Bloody Kansas, which is continuing to this day. If we highlight that fact, his popularity can be hampered, as Bloody Kansas has led to many deaths, all of which are caused by that raid."
 kansas_election.6.a:0 "It was a necessity"
 kansas_election.6.b:0 "It could have been avoided"
 kansas_election.7.t:0 "Beecher's Evolution Stance"
 kansas_election.7.desc:0 "As Henry Ward Beecher is a clergyman, he should have the representation of a holy man, especially as he's running for president. He is claiming that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, widely rejected by the clergy, actually holds water. This is a controversial claim, seen by many as false."
 kansas_election.7.a:0 "The clergy is not always right"
 kansas_election.7.b:0 "He is not a proper clergyman"
 kansas_election.8.t:0 "Beecher's Bibles"
 kansas_election.8.desc:0 "Henry Ward Beecher is funding the Bloody Kansas period, funding rifles to be send to the abolitionist forces in their fight. That can be spun as him prolonging the period, causing Kansan deaths."
 kansas_election.8.a:0 "He is doing holy work"
 kansas_election.8.b:0 "The period must end"
 kansas_election.9.t:0 "Shall We Compromise"
 kansas_election.9.desc:0 "Henry Ward Beecher's book is a best-seller, as he's arguing that the compromise between the pro and anti-slavery forces in the Compromise of 1850 should have not happened. Of course, we do support abolition, but this could be taken as he's unwilling to compromise with opposing viewpoints."
 kansas_election.9.a:0 "He's right"
 kansas_election.9.b:0 "Compromise is sometimes necessary"
 kansas_election.10.t:0 "Donation season"
 kansas_election.10.desc:0 "Today has overseen a lot of donations to the election candidates, and we as the state have taken our fair cut. Our treasury is more full than ever, and we could afford increased spending."
 kansas_election.10.a:0 "It is a blessing"
 kansas_election.11.t:0 "An election massacre"
 kansas_election.11.desc:0 "The election is coming closer and closer, and so have noticed the pro-slavery people. Just today, a massacre has occurred in one of our cities regarding support for one of the candidates."
 kansas_election.11.a:0 "Bloody Kansas is still ongoing"
 kansas_election.12.t:0 "The 1861 election"
 kansas_election.12.desc:0 "The long-awaited first election of the republic has started. Planned to continue for a month, this election will decide the first president of the republic. The votes are being cast, and the race is close. It seems to be up to chance as to who will be the winner of the election."
 kansas_election.12.a:0 "We'll see the results."
 kansas_election.13.t:0 "Henry Ward Beecher wins the election!"
 kansas_election.13.desc:0 "The charismatic priest Henry Ward Beecher has won the general election. Planning to unite this nation under God's love, H. W. Beecher will take action against the cruelty of slavery, bringing the young state of Kansas into the bright future."
 kansas_election.13.a:0 "We have beeen blessed."
 kansas_election.14.t:0 "[GetBrown] wins the election!"
 kansas_election.14.desc:0 "The infamous ranger [GetBrown] has won the general election. Having experience in the fight against the Ruffians, Brown plans to end slavery once and for all in the entirety of former United States."
 kansas_election.14.a:0 "The people will be free."
 kansas_election.15.t:0 "Charles Lawrence Robinson wins the election!"
 kansas_election.15.desc:0 "The successful city mayor Charles Lawrence Robinson has won the general election. A prominent Free Statist whose town serves as the centre of the Kansas's anti-slavery movement, C. L. Robinson promises to bring progress and prosperity to Kansas."
 kansas_election.15.a:0 "There was no doubt of him winning."

 bloody_kansas.9.a:0 "Finally."
 bloody_kansas.10.t:0 "Civil War!"
 bloody_kansas.10.desc:0 "We have done a poor job managing the situation. The Border Ruffians have united and entered a state of organised rebellion against the country. We are in a need to mobilise our forces if we have to crush it."
