Slavs were settling fields and forests of Russian plains for thousand years, then Novogorodians were settling tundras of Northern Russia and it culminated in unrestrained march in XVI and XVII centuries, when Russians have appeared to set their foothold in Siberia and the Far East. Having minor setback occurred in Nerchinsk, where Qin Empire managed to make profitable for itself treaty and rob Russia of their conquests due to corruption of Russian officials, Russians still had vast reaches of Siberia to their disposal, with its rich stocks of natural resources, such as iron, copper, gems, coal, fur and wood. But this gigantic region, having space for at least another Europe, is more scarcely populated than European Russia and can't be even compared to France or Austria in terms of inhabitants. That's why Russian government always launched campaigns to settle Siberia with colonists, mostly consisting of peasants and cossacks. In XIX century problem still stays while peasantry of European Russia become more and more poor with their plots of land growing smaller and smaller each generation. If government will dedicate some resources and also will get rid of corrupted bureaucrats in the trail of migrants, problems with peasantry can be very much negated... until next generation."
