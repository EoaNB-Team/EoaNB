spain.3.a:0 "We must assume the decisions of the queen as our party has always done."
spain.3.b:0 "This is an outrage, the queen must not interfere in politics in this way."

spain.13.d:0 "Fernando Poo, a little island in the Gulf of Guinea, has belonged to Spain since 1777. However, the colonization of the island was not fully effective until 1858. In that year, a dedicated mission of the Spanish Navy was executed to assure the dominion of the area. In such expedition, the pretty new steam ship “Vasco Nuñez de Balboa” participated projecting the necessary power to guarantee the control of the island."
spain.13.a:0 "It seems that the previous efforts are somewhat useful"

spain.14.t: "Plan de Escuadra 1848-1855"
spain.14.d:0 "With the leadership of the Ministry of the Navy, Mariano Roca de Togores, marquis of Molins, and the support of the Government of Isabella II, a dedicated plan to develop and modernize the declining Spanish Navy was implemented. The main objectives were to improve the current naval dockyards and to build new ones in order to recover the lost time for the Spanish Navy. Nine years later, we are finally able to collect the benefits and get closer to the Great Powers Navies."
spain.14.a:0 "The Spanish Navy must be glorious again"

spain.15.t: "Cochinchina French-Spanish Campaign"
spain.15.d:0 "In 1858, the French Empire invades Indochine trying to expand its colonies around the world. With the pretext of the assassination of two Spanish missionaries, France invites Spain to join to the campaign. Spain accepts and contributes to the war effort providing up to 4000 soldiers and several war ships as the steamboats “Elcano” and “Jorge Juan”. Finally, Spain was not awarded with any territory but, at least, some valorous experience was obtained."
spain.15.a:0 "Some compensation assuring the spreading of Catholicism"

spain_caribbean.7.t:0 "The morality of La Hispaniola"
spain_caribbean.7.d:0 "Despite the fact that the majority of the population is still of Hispanic origin, since its independence La Hispaniola has received different influences from other religions and cultures due to immigration. We must ensure that the population follows a Catholic moral as is customary in Spain, to achieve unity and stability in the territory."
spain_caribbean.7.a:0 "Raise taxes on those who differ from our way of life."

spain_caribbean.10.t: "Riots Over Celebration Cancellation!"
spain_caribbean.10.d:0 "After the Celebration was being broken up, resistance broke out. The riotors painted the words "oppressor" across Spanish buildings, and the gaurds where quickly overtaken. With little resistance they burned the government buildings under Spanish rule."
spain_caribbean.10.a:0 "Quell this riot! Send our army!"

spain_caribbean.11.t: "Heretical Celebration Prevented!"
spain_caribbean.11.d:0 ""
spain_caribbean.11.a:0 "Good thing we prevented such herecy from occuring!"
  
spain_caribbean.12.t:0 "The Protestant threat"
spain_caribbean.12.d:0 "Our recent attempts to return the people of La Hispaniola to the path of the Lord and of Spain have borne fruit. However, the minority most reluctant to change their way of life have turned out to be the Protestant communities. Having these heretics within the borders of Spain as citizens is embarrassing as well as dangerous for the stability of the country. We must decide how to tackle this problem."
spain_caribbean.12.a:0 "There is no place for heretics in Spain, expel them!"
spain_caribbean.12.b:0 "Strengthen conversion efforts with missionaries."
spain_caribbean.12.c:0 "Let the whole world remind them that this is not God's way."

spain_caribbean.13.t: "Catholic Mob Forming in [FROM.GetName]!"
spain_caribbean.13.d:0 "A new church is being built in [FROM.GetName] by a protestant community. A catholic priest encourages a mob to burn the protestant church. If nothing is done, the mob will likely succeed."
spain_caribbean.13.a:0 "We cant be bothered with domestic affairs..."
spain_caribbean.13.b:0 "Tell the protestants to relocate their church far away."

spain_caribbean.14.t: "Meetings of Masonry Lodges in La Hispaniola"
spain_caribbean.14.d:0 "Recent reports affirm that the high society of Creole landowners of La Hispaniola regularly meets in Masonry Lodges and private parties. Amongst these ostentatious parties loom powerful figures in powerful places within society. Could conspiracies be concocted within these secret meetings? Could their be authentic plots against Spain, as has happened in the past? We must decide how to act in the face of this potential threat.\n\nThough before banning them outright, what ramifications could occur from stripping powerful people from their thrones? Are we willing to make an enemy of such influential people? Only one question remains... what will we do about these Freemasons?"
spain_caribbean.14.a:0 "End this secrecy and ban these lodges! Even if it angers them, we cant take chances!"
spain_caribbean.14.b:0 "Allow them to operate, but remind them who they pay their respects to."

spain_caribbean.15.t: "Masonry Lodge Conspiracy in [FROM.GetName]!"
spain_caribbean.15.d:0 ""
spain_caribbean.15.a:0 "Maybe we can bribe them to be on our side..."
spain_caribbean.15.b:0 "We dont have the political power to bribe them..."
spain_caribbean.15.c:0 "We cant be bothered with domestic affairs..."

spain_caribbean.16.t: "Masonry Lodge Monopolise Importations!"
spain_caribbean.16.d:0 "A bunch of criollo landowners in Hispaniola have made a deal monopolising the importations of wine in the island making great profit but hurting Spain's tax system in the importations. They seem to be amassing a greath wealth for some purpose..."
spain_caribbean.16.a:0 "This is terrible!"

spain_caribbean.17.t: "Masonry Lodge Betray the Bribe!"
spain_caribbean.17.d:0 "Despite bribing the criollo landowners, they have made a deal monopolising the importations of wine in Hispaniola at the expense of Spain's tax system. Now making a great profit from our bribe and the importations, they have amassed a greath wealth for some purpose..."
spain_caribbean.17.b:0 "Those backstabbers!"

spain_caribbean.18.t: "Masonry Lodge Honor the Bribe!"
spain_caribbean.18.d:0 "The criollo landowners honored the bribe and the rest of the monopoly conspirators have been imprisoned. Though we're uncertain why such a conspiracy was undertaken..."
spain_caribbean.18.b:0 "Sometimes one must pay a price for loyalty."

spain_caribbean.19.t: "The Crown Strips all Masonry Lodges of Power"
spain_caribbean.19.d:0 "The The Grand Symbolic Lodge holds massive influence over the politics of Santo Domingo. It is a high society of wealthy landowners, nobles, and politicians with deep connections. Often these connections allow them to gain massive amounts of wealth from trade deals, negotiations, and legislation. An elite club one might call it, a club the Spanish Crown is not apart of... and that is why they banned it."
spain_caribbean.19.a:0 "We will not be put down like an intimidating dog! We will resist!"
spain_caribbean.19.b:0 "The Masonry Lodge held too much influence, this is the only way."

spain_caribbean.20.t: "The Crown Sanctions Masonry Lodges"
spain_caribbean.20.d:0 "The The Grand Symbolic Lodge holds massive influence over the politics of Santo Domingo. It is a high society of wealthy landowners, nobles, and politicians with deep connections. Often these connections allow them to gain massive amounts of wealth from trade deals, negotiations, and legislation. An elite club one might call it, a club the Spanish Crown has announced itself 'president' of... Because of this, the Crown has announced in a speach their existance depends on their cooperation with Spain and her interests."
spain_caribbean.20.a:0 "Tedious, but the Crown underestimates our influential reach..."

spain_caribbean.21.t:0 "The administration of La Hispaniola"
spain_caribbean.21.d:0 "Following the recent annexation of the Dominican Republic to Spain, we have encountered a political dilemma. Although the administrations of La Hispaniola continue to bear a striking resemblance to our Caribbean administrations, they are not completely identical and have undergone slight changes during their years of independence. Furthermore, these administrations are strongly dominated by the local Creole aristocracy, which hinders our influence in the territory. We could respect these institutions and the local upper class without disturbing the status quo too much or we could take advantage of the similarity between administrations to easily remodel the entire structure and ensure the dominance of the Spanish state."
spain_caribbean.21.a:0 "They need the Caribbean administration."
spain_caribbean.21.b:0 "Reach a middle ground."
spain_caribbean.21.c:0 "We do not need to get involved in the administration of La Hispaniola."

spain_caribbean.22.t: "Dominican Loan Payments Cease"
spain_caribbean.22.d:0 "Due to the recent Bankruptcy declared by the [DOM.GetName], they are no longer to pay foreign loan payments. This has reduced, although only slightly, the income we get form countries paying back debts to Spain."

spain_caribbean.23.t: "Sale of Cuba pays Dividends"
spain_caribbean.23.d:0 "Today an installment on the sale of Hispaniola arrived from the United States of America. We should invest this money to combat our ongoing economic crisis."

Once the army arrived the workers did not oppose any resistance and the local bourgeoisie blamed the mayor for the events that happened. However rumors have spread around the nation that these revolutionaries have made atrocities with the population."
spanishflavour.8.a:0 "Nooo!"

spanishflavour.9.t: "Remembrance of Cámara's Speech"
spanishflavour.9.d:0 "Eight Years ago Sixto Cámara made a speech in parliament to describe the plights of the farmers in spain.\n\n'Is it not an insult to tell a man, who spends every waking hour, who works in the coldest of days, the heaviest of rain, who endures the frostbites of winter, the sunburns of summer, that they are a slacker for taking a vacation. That farmer who must bare the torture of the penetrating cries of their wife and children asking for food or clothing. Is it not an insult, and I must stress this, is it not an insult to say to this farmer; That you may bake the bread wherever you want, that you may kill the game that lives in your lands, that you may aspire like anyone else to high positions in the State; because clearly, we are all equally capable of doing so.'"
