 #Puerto Rico
 spain_caribbean.5.t: "The Cry of Lares"
 spain_caribbean.5.d: "After the various movements for independence united , such as the one made by Ramón Emeterio Betances, the tensions in Puerto Rico had been brewing. Betances had created a revolutionary committee in Puerto Rico, asking for liberty for  the free man. He demanded freedom of commerce and press, demanded the rights to own weapons and to elect, along with many liberal reforms such as the end of slavery. In response to his ideals, Spain had arrested him and many revolutionaries. \n\nFearing to be arrested, the revolutionaries gathered support for their ideals, organized into 12 leaders and held meetings. Under the leadership of Rojas and Medina, the puerto ricans have rose up in Lares!"
 spain_caribbean.5.a: "Surpress this revolt!"
 spain_caribbean.5.b: "Fight for Rojas! (Play as Puerto Rico)"

 spain_caribbean.6.t: "Cry of Lares surpressed"
 spain_caribbean.6.d: "The Cry of Lares has been stopped, the liberation army was crushed and the Puerto Rican forces have surrendered. The organized revolt still created a nationalistic sentiment within the Puerto Ricans and we need to choose how to deal with that. Will we exile and imprison the forces like we did to the leaders and surpress them or give them some loose autonomy?"
 spain_caribbean.6.a: "Victory for Spain!"

spain_caribbean.7.t: "The morality of La Hispaniola"
spain_caribbean.7.d: "Despite the fact that the majority of the population is still of Hispanic origin, since its independence La Hispaniola has received different influences from other religions and cultures due to immigration.

spain_caribbean.10.d: "After the Celebration was being broken up, resistance broke out. The riotors painted the words "oppressor" across Spanish buildings, and the gaurds where quickly overtaken. With little resistance they burned the government buildings under Spanish rule."

spain_caribbean.12.t: "The Protestant threat"
spain_caribbean.12.d: "Our recent attempts to return the people of La Hispaniola to the path of the Lord and of Spain have borne fruit. However, the minority most reluctant to change their way of life have turned out to be the Protestant communities. Having these heretics within the borders of Spain as citizens is embarrassing as well as dangerous for the stability of the country. We must decide how to tackle this problem."
spain_caribbean.12.a: "There is no place for heretics in Spain, expel them!"
spain_caribbean.12.b: "Strengthen conversion efforts with missionaries."

spain_caribbean.14.t: "Meetings of Masonry Lodges in La Hispaniola"
spain_caribbean.14.d: "Recent reports affirm that the high society of Creole landowners of La Hispaniola regularly meets in Masonry Lodges and private parties. Amongst these ostentatious parties loom powerful figures in powerful places within society. Could conspiracies be concocted within these secret meetings? Could their be authentic plots against Spain, as has happened in the past? We must decide how to act in the face of this potential threat.\n\nThough before banning them outright, what ramifications could occur from stripping powerful people from their thrones? Are we willing to make an enemy of such influential people? Only one question remains... what will we do about these Freemasons?"
spain_caribbean.14.a: "End this secrecy and ban these lodges! Even if it angers them, we cant take chances!"
spain_caribbean.14.b: "Allow them to operate, but remind them who they pay their respects to."

spain_caribbean.15.t: "Masonry Lodge Conspiracy in [FROM.GetName]!"

spain_caribbean.16.d: "A bunch of criollo landowners in Hispaniola have made a deal monopolising the importations of wine in the island making great profit but hurting Spain's tax system in the importations. They seem to be amassing a greath wealth for some purpose..."
spain_caribbean.16.a: "This is terrible!"

spain_caribbean.17.t: "Masonry Lodge Betray the Bribe!"
spain_caribbean.17.d: "Despite bribing the criollo landowners, they have made a deal monopolising the importations of wine in Hispaniola at the expense of Spain's tax system. Now making a great profit from our bribe and the importations, they have amassed a greath wealth for some purpose..."
spain_caribbean.17.b: "Those backstabbers!"

spain_caribbean.18.t: "Masonry Lodge Honor the Bribe!"
spain_caribbean.18.d: "The criollo landowners honored the bribe and the rest of the monopoly conspirators have been imprisoned. Though we're uncertain why such a conspiracy was undertaken..."
spain_caribbean.18.b: "Sometimes one must pay a price for loyalty."

spain_caribbean.19.t: "The Crown Strips all Masonry Lodges of Power"
spain_caribbean.19.d: "The The Grand Symbolic Lodge holds massive influence over the politics of Santo Domingo. It is a high society of wealthy landowners, nobles, and politicians with deep connections. Often these connections allow them to gain massive amounts of wealth from trade deals, negotiations, and legislation. An elite club one might call it, a club the Spanish Crown is not apart of... and that is why they banned it."
spain_caribbean.19.a: "We will not be put down like an intimidating dog! We will resist!"
spain_caribbean.19.b: "The Masonry Lodge held too much influence, this is the only way."

spain_caribbean.20.t: "The Crown Sanctions Masonry Lodges"
spain_caribbean.20.d: "The The Grand Symbolic Lodge holds massive influence over the politics of Santo Domingo. It is a high society of wealthy landowners, nobles, and politicians with deep connections.

An elite club one might call it, a club the Spanish Crown has announced itself 'president' of... Because of this, the Crown has announced in a speach their existance depends on their cooperation with Spain and her interests."
spain_caribbean.20.a: "Tedious, but the Crown underestimates our influential reach..."
  
spain_caribbean.21.t: "The administration of La Hispaniola"
spain_caribbean.21.d: "Following the recent annexation of the Dominican Republic to Spain, we have encountered a political dilemma. Although the administrations of La Hispaniola continue to bear a striking resemblance to our Caribbean administrations, they are not completely identical and have undergone slight changes during their years of independence. Furthermore, these administrations are strongly dominated by the local Creole aristocracy, which hinders our influence in the territory. We could respect these institutions and the local upper class without disturbing the status quo too much or we could take advantage of the similarity between administrations to easily remodel the entire structure and ensure the dominance of the Spanish state."
spain_caribbean.21.a: "They need the Caribbean administration."
spain_caribbean.21.b: "Reach a middle ground."
spain_caribbean.21.c: "We do not need to get involved in the administration of La Hispaniola."

spain_caribbean.22.t: "Dominican Loan Payments Cease"
spain_caribbean.22.d: "Due to the recent Bankruptcy declared by the [DOM.GetName], they are no longer to pay foreign loan payments. This has reduced, although only slightly, the income we get form countries paying back debts to Spain."

That farmer who must bare the torture of the penetrating cries of their wife and children asking for food or clothing. Is it not an insult, and I must stress this, is it not an insult to say to this farmer; That you may bake the bread wherever you want, that you may kill the game that lives in your lands, that you may aspire like anyone else to high positions in the State; because clearly, we are all equally capable of doing so.'"

 spanishflavour.18.d: "The Republican Federal Party of Spain has just signed a new pact in 17 legislative states, stating that the founding of the first Spanish Republic is near.
