##Tuscan Focus Tree
TUS_focus_the_tuscan_economy: "The Tuscan Economy"
TUS_focus_the_tuscan_economy_desc: " If we are to become more than just a state to be dictated by foreign powers, we must develop an economy. Turning our focus here will benefit all of Tuscany."
TUS_focus_the_sharecropping_debates: "The Sharecropping Debate"
TUS_focus_the_sharecropping_debates_desc: "Due to our agrarian economy, it is obvious that sharecropping should be considered, seeing it’s success in the American south with its cotton industry. While a larger harvest would benefit us, this may upset the people as it will most definitely bring more of the poor into debt with landlords. This must be decided before we go any further with agriculture. "
TUS_focus_textile_industry: "The Textile Industry"
TUS_focus_textile_industry_desc: "The textile industry is something that many have made profits off of, especially in England. We would be foolish to not take advantage of its growth to further boost our economic ambitions."
TUS_focus_the_artisans: "The Artisans"
TUS_focus_the_artisans_desc: "Like much of the Italian peninsula, our economy is dominated by artisan-based industry. With our economy on the way to growing, it is pivotal that we make use of the artisans within our country. Their skill would be much needed in our workforce, and it will help increase our profits from exports with their talents utilized."
TUS_focus_ridolfis_experiment: "Ridolfi's Experiment"
TUS_focus_ridolfis_experiment_desc: "Ridolfi is a man that could bring the reform that Tuscany needs. If wages inspire our workers to work harder, perhaps it would be worth trying this. Productivity is what will keep us thriving, especially with our agrarian economy. However, a significant conflict has erupted between Ridolfi’s supporters and his critics. This may be too expensive, which might mean losing more money than we need to. This must be settled as we work on our agricultural sector."
TUS_focus_reform_elsewhere: "Reform Elsewhere"
TUS_focus_reform_elsewhere_desc: "Despite the promising aspects of Ridolfi's experimentation in the Agricultural sectors, our ministers have never been fond of changes the Tuscan economic outlook. We must look for a different solution, the workers are not the tools we need, though it is becoming clear that the estates might be the ones receiving more power, which will make us more popular with the upper class, the ones with actual power."
TUS_focus_land_reclamation: "Maremma Reclaimations"
TUS_focus_land_reclamation_desc: " Innovation is what we need and with our agrarian economy, it is a doctrine we must utilize to maintain our economy. Making artificial land would give us more land to farm and more land for the estates to control, which can kickstart our agricultural sector above the rest of Italy."
TUS_focus_power_to_the_estates: "Power to the Estates"
TUS_focus_power_to_the_estates_desc: "The estates are what makes us profits, workers may be important but with no estates, there would be no farms for us to profit off of. We must give the necessary power to the estates that allows them to work as efficiently as possible, which would only bring more into our pockets."
TUS_focus_introduce_wage_labour: "Introduce Wage Labor"
TUS_focus_introduce_wage_labour_desc: "According to Ridolfi’s plans, we will introduce wages for workers which will increase our worker’s productivity for a small cost. This will also reduce tensions when it comes to sharecropping, a small price to pay for the stability of our nation."
TUS_focus_curtail_innovation: "Curtail Innovation"
TUS_focus_curtail_innovation_desc: "Why fix what works? Making artificial land does not help us, the productivity of our workers does! The work they do, which has increased due to the wages we have given them, is enough for us to move forward. We must stomp out outrageous ideas of innovation, and stick to what works."
TUS_focus_power_to_the_workers: "Power to the Workers"
TUS_focus_power_to_the_workers_desc: "With the new reforms we have made, worker productivity is at its absolute height! Fields are being worked with a national drive and with much needed stability being brought within our lower-class populace. By giving power to the workers, we are getting more profits along with a more stable agricultural society."
TUS_focus_continue_with_free_trade: "Continue with Free Trade"
TUS_focus_continue_with_free_trade_desc: "The Grand Duke and his government have long been proponents of Free Trade. Exports are something we must utilize if we want to be a shining star in Italian economics. With artisan talents and a workforce with growing skill, we have the methods to create economic interests for other nations to invest in. Not only will our economy grow, but we will gain much needed trade relations as well."
TUS_focus_protect_tuscan_production: "Protect Tuscan Production"
TUS_focus_protect_tuscan_production_desc: "We must keep a firm hold on our products, our resources, and our economic independence. Depending on foreign trade could put us in an economic disaster and trade relations can threaten our isolation. We must stop the excessive exports, so we can put our own resources to our own use, which will be far more reliant than exports."
TUS_focus_consumers_exist_not_in_the_countryside: "Consumers Exist not in the Countryside"
TUS_focus_consumers_exist_not_in_the_countryside_desc: "If we are to make a real profit, we must accept the fact that our economy does not depend on our internal powers but more so from foreign buyers, regardless of our plans on trade, it is important that we maintain some level of trade."
TUS_focus_but_outside_the_countryside: "But Outside the Country"
TUS_focus_but_outside_the_countryside_desc: "In the words of a Livorian banker, the Tuscan market is too small compared to what it could be. We must put efforts towards expanding the market if we are to reach our economic peak. We must expand our reach through trade, which will help our economy run along smoothly."
TUS_focus_the_expanding_grain_market: "The Expanding Grain Market"
TUS_focus_the_expanding_grain_market_desc: "Grain has become a valued and more necessary resource that provides an opportunity for us to take advantage of. With increased harvests and our agricultural sector being expanded and improved upon, we can export grain to foreign powers with a guaranteed profit."
TUS_focus_the_iron_industry: "The Iron Industry"
TUS_focus_the_iron_industry_desc: " Iron is a resource that is growing in value which we have. We must dig deep and greedily, as with technology moving forward that utilizes iron, it will be important for us to be a step ahead, which benefits both sides of our trading policies. "
TUS_focus_learn_from_leghorn: "Learn from Leghorn"
TUS_focus_learn_from_leghorn_desc: "If Tuscany is to prosper, then we must learn from the ways of Livorno. The profits that were made from a free port city is something that we Tuscans should take advantage of, and it can benefit our intentions to increase the Tuscan market’s reach to Europeans. Just in the way of Livorno, we shall make our port cities hubs for trading profit."
TUS_focus_modernisation: "Modernization"
TUS_focus_modernisation_desc: "As we push economically, it is vital that we recognize the need for modernization, we must study foreign techniques, to replace our outdated techniques and equipment. This is needed so we can push Tuscany’s capabilities to their limit. "
TUS_focus_not_industrialisation: "Railway Developments"
TUS_focus_not_industrialisation_desc: "The Grand Duke of Tuscany long supported the development of rail in Tuscany. Railways could even be found in Lucca prior to its annexation into Tuscany. Multiple politicians and companies support the expansion of rail networks all around Tuscany to help support the economy."
TUS_focus_social_concerns: "Social Concerns"
TUS_focus_social_concerns_desc: "With the world changing, and Tuscany along with it, our social society has grown reasonably worried. We must address the concerns of the lower and upper class to help maintain our economic stability. Along with this, it can bring much needed trust back into the government from both sides. "
TUS_focus_stability_for_workers: "Stability for Workers"
TUS_focus_stability_for_workers_desc: "While there is debate on the priority of land owners and workers, it is also known that both are vital. We must provide stability for the lower class workers. After-all, without anyone to work the farms, there would be no harvest for us to profit off of. "
TUS_focus_and_for_land_owners: "And for Land Owners"
TUS_focus_and_for_land_owners_desc: "Land owners are a very important factor in our growing agricultural setting, without them, there would be no farms for us to profit off of and there would be no harvest as well. We must provide stability for them as well, as we push Tuscany to a golden age of agricultural modernization and improvement."

# Tuscan Political Tree
TUS_focus_the_political_scene: "The Political Scene"
TUS_focus_the_political_scene_desc: "The Politics of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany are not what they used to be. Power is held almost entirely by the Duke and the nobility. After Austria forced the removal of the constitution, liberal elements of society were pushed underground. However, these movements are still strong and may rise to challenge the Duke or call on him to remember his past support of liberalism."
TUS_focus_memories_of_the_past: "Memories of the Past"
TUS_focus_memories_of_the_past_desc: "The Revolutions of 1848 were a great period in Tuscany. The Grand Duke supported Sardinia's war against Austria and a constitution was enacted. Unfortunately our forces did not find favor in the war and the Austrian Empire demanded the removal of the constitution. These events continue to haunt the Tuscan society."
TUS_focus_de_moderate_liberalism: "Moderate Liberalism"
TUS_focus_de_moderate_liberalism_desc: "Liberalism is not an unfamiliar concept to the Tuscan people. The Grand Duke himself supported liberal elements of the revolutions of 1848. We can work towards liberalizing society and avoiding the eyes of Austria, though a choice must be made if we will entrust that to Radicals or Republicans."
TUS_focus_into_radicalism: "Towards Radicalism"
TUS_focus_into_radicalism_desc: "Radicalism has always been a powerful force within Italy. From the Carbonari in the south to the mazzinian societies of the North. Putting our faith in them again is our only chance to free Tuscany from the autocratic yoke."
TUS_focus_into_republicanism: "Towards Republicanism"
TUS_focus_into_republicanism_desc: "If we are to liberalize Tuscany it must be done with the support of the Grand Duke. The people still have some admiration for the Grand Duke despite the authority he rules with. With Leopold II leading a more liberal Tuscany we will be better situated to challenge Austrian influence and ensure our government's strength."
TUS_focus_strengthen_the_national_society: "Strengthen the National Society"
TUS_focus_strengthen_the_national_society_desc: "The Italian National Societies exist across the peninsula as groups of revolutionaries, radicals, and liberals. Many of the groups contain politicians and spread their words and arms alike around in order to increase support for Italian Unification."
TUS_focus_convince_the_populace: "Convince the Populace"
TUS_focus_convince_the_populace_desc: "If Tuscany is to be liberalized the people must be convinced that we will not fail again. There are various steps we can take to decrease Austrian influence and work towards building that trust."
TUS_focus_revivce_hopes_for_constitutional_monarchy: "Constitutional Monarchy"
TUS_focus_revivce_hopes_for_constitutional_monarchy_desc: "The position of Prime Minister does already exist in the Tuscan government, so transitioning to a proper constitutional monarchy will not be incredibly difficult. "

TUS_focus_revive_the_1848_goals_desc: "The goals of the revolutions of 1848 never did come to fruition completely. As we move to utilize radical elements of Tuscan politics, those goals will need to be executed."
TUS_focus_prepare_for_revolution: "Prepare for Revolution"
TUS_focus_prepare_for_revolution_desc: "It has been decided. The only way to properly liberalize Tuscany will be through revolution!"
TUS_focus_work_with_outside_forces: "Work with Outside Forces"

TUS_focus_a_message_to_others: "A Message to Others"
TUS_focus_a_message_to_others_desc: "Sardinia-Piedmont is not the only nation seeking to weaken Austria. Though it is unlikely that we will get any direct support, it may be possible to find material support from other nations."
TUS_focus_a_message_to_sardinia: "A Message to Sardinia"
TUS_focus_a_message_to_sardinia_desc: "Sardinia-Piedmont is our natural ally against the Austrians as they proceed with their aspirations to unite Italy. Though there may be disagreements between our two nations on the future of Italy, we can agree to eliminating the Austrian menace from the peninsula."
TUS_focus_the_farmer_rebellion: "The Farmer's Rebellion"
TUS_focus_the_farmer_rebellion_desc: "With the war between Sardinia-Piedmont and Austria nearing, the farmers of Tuscany have prepared to enter into rebellion.

TUS_focus_favour_a_party: "Favor a Party"
TUS_focus_favour_a_party_desc: "Grand Duke Leopold still has a lot of influence in the politics of Tuscany, despite his transition to head of state. The next prime minister may not be an ally of the Duke strictly speaking, but giving support to someone with the right ideas will lead Tuscany in the right direction."
TUS_focus_the_republicans: "The Republicans"
TUS_focus_the_republicans_desc: "The Republicans, though not strong supporters of the Duke, were strong supporters of our efforts in the 1848 war against Austria. Running for prime minister is a former member of the Council of Milan, someone well informed in the ideas necessary to liberalize Italy."
TUS_focus_the_conservatives: "The Conservatives"
TUS_focus_the_conservatives_desc: "The Conservatives are much stronger supporters of the Duke and the new constitutional monarchy. Ensuring the election of a conservative prime minister with popular support will create a strong relationship between the new government and Leopold's new position."

# Tuscan Events
risorgimento.500.t: "The Grand Duchy of Tuscany"
risorgimento.500.d: "The Grand Duchy of Tuscany has long been ruled by the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, interrupted only during Napoleon's conquest of Italy. During the revolutions of 1848 the Grand Duke Leopold II embraced liberalism and our soldiers fought side by side with those from Sardinia, The Papal States, and the Kingdom of Naples. Overthrown by popular revolt still, Leopold could only return to rule Tuscany with the assistance of Austria, whose garrison only left in 1855. With the liberal constitution revoked the politics of the Duchy are stagnant. An incompetent ruling class rules over the land of Tuscany. As Sardinia-Piedmont is beginning to suggest Italian Unity our people become restless. Will the traditions of our Duchy lead us to dust, or will we embrace the republican spirit of our people?"
risorgimento.500.a: "It is a trying time"
risorgimento.501.t: "The Tuscan Economy"
risorgimento.501.d: "The Tuscan Economy is almost entirely agrarian. The largest export from our nation is grain. Despite the agrarian occupation that many of our citizens hold, there is a growing artisan industry as the need for manufacturing increases. Rails in the Duchy are in the midst of an upgrade as work with the Austrian rail companies assists the connections we make between our capital and the port city of Livorno. Livorno is the home of trade and industry for Tuscany. Textiles and Iron flow from the port as the base for our economy. However, a battle is brewing between land owners and peasants, and bosses and workers."
risorgimento.501.a: "More Problems to Solve"
risorgimento.502.t: "The Sharecropping Debate"
risorgimento.502.d: "Feudalism has never really left Tuscany. The Sharecroppers, mezzadros, has a compact with the landowner to cultivate land and share profits from sales in return for housing, seeds, and other minor goods. The merits of this system are being called into question by our politicians, especially the liberal ones. More and more farmers are demanding the rights to own their own land."
risorgimento.502.a: "The future of mezzadria is in question"
risorgimento.503.t: "The Ridolfi Experiment"
risorgimento.503.d: "Cosimo Ridofli operates a fine winery in Tuscany. As the issues with sharecropping influence many land owners, Ridolfi has proposed possibly introducing wage labor on a wider scale in Tuscany. Wage labor is something usually reserved to those who work with the artisans or other part of the economy. There is disagreement if introducing wage labor to agriculture could solve our issues or make them worse."
risorgimento.503.a: "We must introduce wage labor"
risorgimento.503.b: "Our reforms must be elsewhere"
risorgimento.504.t: "The Political Scene"
risorgimento.504.d: "Leopold II is not a very popular leader. His dynasty is propped up by Austria and their empire influences our nation a great deal. One condition of his return was the removal of the constitution, something the liberal politicians seek to have returned. There are minor legislative powers in the government but much power is centralized. As rumors that Sardinia-Piedmont will make its attempt to unify Italy soon are spreading, so is discontent and shadow organizations."
risorgimento.504.a: "The future is unknown"
risorgimento.505.t: "Memories of 1848"
risorgimento.505.d: "Following the revolutions of 1848 the Grand Duchy of Tuscany joined the Sardinian coalition in the fight against Austria. Our troops eventually pulled out along with those of the Two Sicilies and Papal States, and our people revolted against Duke Leopold II. The Austrian Empire eventually put down the revolt and reinstated Leopold, at the cost of removing the constitution granted after the revolutions. The people do not have fond memories of the events that unfolded."
risorgimento.505.a: "An unfortunate legacy"
risorgimento.506.t: "Liberalism in Tuscany"
risorgimento.506.d: "Though not present today, Tuscany has a long history of liberal elements. It was the original Senate of the Forty-Eight that eventually allowed the Medici family to create the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In Tuscany today liberalism is all but criminalized. Liberal politicians work in secret organizations away from the public eye. With Austrian influence in the nation, many wonder if a radical approach is necessary just as it was in 1848. There are a wealth of secret radical societies and exiled politicians that would be ready to assist a new uprising. On the other hand, if Leopold II came out in support of a constitutional monarchy, it could diminish the chance that Austria attempts to interfere in our nation's politics again."
risorgimento.506.a: "Radicalism is our only hope"
risorgimento.506.b: "Republicanism is our only chance"
risorgimento.507.t: "Tuscan National Society"
risorgimento.507.d: "Italian National Societies exist across the peninsula. Most prominent are the societies in Piedmont and Lombardy. Originally founded by the supporters of Mazzini, these societies support the unification of Italy through a variety of means. In Tuscany the national societies have been forced underground. Allowing these societies to return to a more public scene will further support for liberalizing Tuscany."
risorgimento.507.a: "The time for change has come"
risorgimento.508.t: "An End to the Sharecropping Debate?"
risorgimento.508.d: "Drastic changes is the political climate of the nation have reignited debates over the economy of Tuscany. Though the estates and nobles have lost much of their power, sharecropping is not a system that will be removed from Tuscany quickly. Many question if it is time for our nation to finally adopt the Industrial Revolution completely. At the same time, the rest of Europe is removing their farmland and replacing it with factories. Demands for Tuscan grain are higher than ever and clearing land for factories will hamper our ability to meet the needs of nations looking to import our grain. However, a choice must be made."
risorgimento.508.a: "Embrace the Industrial Revolution"
risorgimento.508.b: "We must ride out our agrarian roots longer"
risorgimento.509.t: "The Path to Perugia"
risorgimento.509.d: "There has long been plans to expand our rail lines into Perugia. These plans have been proposed from various politicians and companies. Grand Duke Leopold II originally desired to have the line pass through Siena, extending the Florence-Siena line. Bettino Ricaosoli and many other favored extending the Arezzo line. With the completion of both the Siena and Arezzo lines, a decision must be made regarding the path to Perugia."
risorgimento.509.a: "The Siena Line"
risorgimento.509.b: "The Arezzo Line"
risorgimento.510.t: "The Constitutional Monarchy"
risorgimento.510.d: "It is no secret that Leopold II harbors some support for the liberal movements within Italy. In a bold move against the Austrian Empire Leopold II has allowed the transition towards a Constitutional Monarchy to begin. Giovanni Baldasseroni, prime minister under Leopold II, has been given a temporary increase in power as the office of the Prime Minister will take over as head of government. Leopold II will remain as head of state and though his political power is certainly weakened, his dynasty has secured a place in Tuscan politics."
risorgimento.510.a: "This was a necessary step to take"
risorgimento.511.t: "Return of the Constitution"
risorgimento.511.d: "It has been a long time now that Tuscany has lacked a proper constitution. After the first constitution was forcibly removed by the Austrian Empire many doubted that such a thing could return to Tuscany. Against all odds, however, our people have triumphed and the Constitution has returned. This time around, Austria will not be able to force her will on us."
risorgimento.511.a: "The Freedom of Italians must be protected!"
risorgimento.512.t: "Favoring a Party"
risorgimento.512.d: "With the Grand Duke's position in the government of Tuscany solidified, the influence of his dynasty cannot be ignored. The first elections for the Prime Minister of Tuscany will occur soon and the victor will not win without the influence of Leopold II."
risorgimento.512.a: "Support the Republicans, keep our \"enemies\" close"
risorgimento.512.b: "The Conservatives are more in line with our views"
risorgimento.513.t: "Elections of 1859"
risorgimento.513.d: "Today will go down as one of the most important days in Italian history. Record numbers of people have come out to vote for the prime minister of Tuscany. Grand Duke Leopold II has presided over the elections and is preparing to announce the victor. It is no secret that he may have influenced the outcome but it has not taken away from the joy of the people."
risorgimento.513.a: "Conservative Ubaldino Peruzzi, last of the Medici's"
risorgimento.513.b: "Republican Carlo Cattaneo, former member of the Council of Milan"
risorgimento.514.t: "Italian Revolutionaries in Parma and Modena"
risorgimento.514.d: "The Duchies of Parma and Modena were forced into the Austro-Sardinian war for the same connections to Austria that once held our nation down. Just like our people refused to fight in favor of Austria, the people of Parma and Modena have formed revolutionary councils with temporary power granted to liberal politicians. These regions are now prepared to join with any cause hoping to unite Italy."
risorgimento.514.a: "Convince their leaders to join us"
risorgimento.514.b: "Fellow Italians United!"
risorgimento.515.t: "Diplomacy with Sardinia-Piedmont"
risorgimento.515.d: "With our ambitions to unify the peninsula known, the time has come to open diplomacy with Sardinia-Piedmont. Many in our government hope that an agreement can be reached that will avoid conflict. Sardinia-Piedmont employs an army that may be difficult to defeat, despite the large number of Italians who now support our efforts. If an agreement is to be reached, it will surely be costly."
risorgimento.515.a: "[TUS.GetLeader] must meet with [PIE.GetLeader]"
risorgimento.515.b: "It is too late for diplomacy"
risorgimento.516.t: "Tuscany seeks Diplomacy"
risorgimento.516.d: "[TUS.GetLeader] is meeting with [PIE.GetLeader] today to discuss the possibility of unifying our governments. Though an extreme measure, both of our governments have expressed desire to see the Italian Peninsula unified. Unfortunate for our position is the fact that Tuscany has embraced a much more liberalized government and outlook than we employ. The people of Italy have become split and fear of revolutionaries joining Tuscany have become very real. The best offer we can accept is to guarantee that our politicians have solidified positions in the new government."
risorgimento.516.a: "We have no choice, secure a position for our politicians"
risorgimento.516.b: "We came this far, war it will have to be"
risorgimento.517.t: "The Costly Agreement"
risorgimento.517.d: "Coming as somewhat of a surprise the government of Sardinia-Piedmont has agreed to unite our governments, requiring only that politicians from Turin are given special positions. While the agreement will tarnish our reputation and introduce possible corruption into our government, it is a great leap into building the legitimacy of our nation and claims."
risorgimento.517.a: "Unification is Near"
risorgimento.518.t: "Hostilities Break Out!"
risorgimento.518.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont was unwilling to attempt to unify our governments, even at the suggestion of placing their politicians in key positions. With no agreement in sight, it did not take long for a state of war to be declared. Sardinia-Piedmont claims that our government is illegitimate and violates agreements made following the Second Independence war, while our claim rests upon our representation of all Italians and the greater liberal unification movement."
risorgimento.518.a: "War is Among Us"
risorgimento.519.t: "Garibaldi Joins our Cause"
risorgimento.519.d: "Giuseppe Garibaldi, hero of the Italian People, has arrived to pledge his support for our movement. All too aware of the elitist present in Turin, Gariabldi was eager to join our attempts to create a truly liberalized Italy. The presence of Garibaldi has increased moral among the people greatly and has given us much legitimacy in the eyes of Italians."
risorgimento.519.a: "Our Victory is certainly Secured!"
risorgimento.520.t: "Supporting Democracy in Tuscany"
risorgimento.520.d: "As our influence in the Central States continues to grow, the question has arisen as to how much support we should dedicate to Tuscan democracy. The people of Tuscany are very supportive of liberalization but many radicals persist to challenge our ideal for unification. Some fear that should we strengthen Tuscan democracy too much, their own radical movement may rise to challenge our hopes for unification."
risorgimento.520.a: "We cannot risk intervention"
risorgimento.520.b: "We must weaken Austria's sphere"
risorgimento.521.t: "A Leader for the Movement"
risorgimento.521.d: "Many prominent figures have risen to the loose leadership circles of the secret societies and radical groups in Tuscany. As the time is approaching for our movement to rise up against the Duke, a leader must be singled out. Many point to Ricasoli - A prominent liberal politician and someone who could represent the hidden agenda of our revolutionary council without making our members' ideology known. Others call on Niccolò Tommaseo who has been in Tuscany since 1857. Tommaseo held important positions in the Republic of San Marco during the revolutions of 1848 and has held firm against Sardinia-Piedmont becoming a power in Italy."
risorgimento.521.a: "Tommaseo shall lead once again"
risorgimento.521.b: "The people trust Ricasoli already"
risorgimento.522.t: "Revolutionary Spirit"
risorgimento.522.d: "There is a certain spirit around Tuscany as of late. The feeling of revolution is in the air as both radicals and liberals join forces in preparing to launch a revolution against the Duke and his oppressive regime. Italians across the peninsula who have been made aware of the plan, through our network of secret societies and operatives, are flocking into Tuscany in order to join in the fight for true liberty in Italy."
risorgimento.522.a: "First we liberate Tuscany, then the whole of Italy"
risorgimento.523.t: "Subverting Austrian Influence"
risorgimento.523.d: "Despite most of their garrisons having left, the Austrian still exert a level of influence over the politics of our nation. The Austrians may be willing to invade once again should our goals be made clear to them too quickly. We must play a dangerous game of politics in order to keep the Austrian eyes away from our activites. As soon as we can convince them to have their garrisons leave the country entirely, we will have more room to expand operations."
risorgimento.523.a: "They must think nothing is amiss..."
risorgimento.524.t: "Tuscan Radicals Request Arms"
risorgimento.524.d: "The Radical movement in Tuscany has requested that we supply them with arms. It is no secret that we would benefit from a weaker Austrian sphere of influence in Italy and supporting the Tuscan movement to break away from the Pro-Austrian Duke Leopold II would help to weaken the Austrian grip on the Italian peninsula."
risorgimento.524.a: "Supply them with Arms"
risorgimento.524.b: "We cannot support them"
risorgimento.527.t: "[FROM.GetDef] Declines Assistance"
risorgimento.527.d: "Our request for assistance has been decline by [FROM.GetDef]. Perhaps they were unwilling to risk any diplomatic issues that could have arisen or maybe they just didn't care to support our movement. Hopefully we can make do without their help."
risorgimento.527.a: "Unfortunate"
risorgimento.528.t: "The French Accept our Request!"
risorgimento.528.d: "The French have accepted our request for arms. Their government is just as eager as we are to see Austrian influence in the Italian peninsula weakened. There is no doubt they may have other motives for supporting us but we cannot be concerned with those now. These arms will help our fight."
risorgimento.528.a: "Merci France!"
risorgimento.525.t: "Tuscan Radicals request Goods"
risorgimento.525.d: "The radical movement in Tuscany has requested that we supply them with goods. It is no secret that after their betrayal in the Crimean War we have not had strong relations with the Austrians. It may be time to have the Austrians weakened in their sphere of influence."
risorgimento.525.a: "Supply them with Goods"
risorgimento.525.b: "We cannot support them"
risorgimento.529.t: "The Russians Accept our Request"
risorgimento.529.d: "Though somewhat surprising, the Russians have agreed to supply us with some goods in order to assist in our fight against Austria and her puppet government in Tuscany. The Austrian Empire betrayed Russia in the Crimean War and it is clear that Russia has not forgiven them yet."
risorgimento.529.a: "These will help our men"
risorgimento.526.t: "Tuscan Radicals Request Supplies"
risorgimento.526.d: "The Radical movement inside Tuscany has requested that we send supplies to assist them in their revolution against Duke Leopold II and furthermore Austria should they intervene to support the Duke. Though we have stayed somewhat neutral in Italy in the past, our politicians have shown interest in helping the people of Central Italy who have been caught between the desires of Sardinia-Piedmont and Austria."
risorgimento.526.a: "Set up a Supply Chain"
risorgimento.526.b: "We cannot help them"
risorgimento.530.t: "The British Send Supplies"
risorgimento.530.d: "Due to support for our cause within the British parliament, the British have accepted our request for supplies. The Tuscan economy is not built to sustain war, let alone to supply a war effort, so these supplies will assist not only our troops but also our civilian industry in ensuring our economy does not collapse."
risorgimento.530.a: "Thank our friends in parliament!"
risorgimento.531.t: "Tuscans Request Withdrawal of our Garrison"
risorgimento.531.d: "Ever since the Revolutions of 1848/, in which the Grand Duchy of Tuscany turned it's forces against us, we have maintained a modest garrison in the city of Florence to deter further revolutionary action. Leopold II eventually came around to accept our demands, which included a removal of the Tuscan Constitution, and our influence has been strong there ever since. Recently, however, the people of Tuscany have grown discontent with our influence being exerted over them. We have received a request from the Grand Duke himself that our garrisons expedite their exit from Tuscany so that a transition of power from the Duke towards a parliament and prime minister may occur unheeded.\n\n Many of our politicians claim that with the current European attitude in Italy not being in our favor, trying to intervene could come at an extreme cost. We also run the risk of Sardinia-Piedmont and her allies taking advantage of the situation to capture what Italian lands we do still hold."
risorgimento.531.a: "We have no choice but to comply"
risorgimento.532.t: "Austrian Garrison Withdrawn!"
risorgimento.532.d: "The Austrian Empire has agreed to withdraw the rest of their garrison from Florence, likely due to international favor turning away from them and fear of Sardinia-Piedmont and her allies taking advantage of the situation. Now that the garrison is gone the transition of power from Duke Leopold II towards the Prime Minister and parliament can begin. Citizens in Florence celebrated throughout the night, this time without the Austrians watching."
risorgimento.532.a: "We can all let out a sigh of relief now"
risorgimento.533.t: "Invasion of the Papal Marche"
risorgimento.533.d: "In order to reach Naples before Gariabldi and his forces do, we will need to enter the Papal Marche. Currently, France has garrisoned many troops in the Papal States and is actively protected their lands from any invasion. However, with Garibaldi announcing plans to march on Rome and Venice, France may be forced to allow our troops to occupy the Marche in order to stop Garibaldi from advancing his conquests."
risorgimento.533.a: "If we must, we can force their hand"
risorgimento.534.t: "Tuscany Requests to Enter the Papal Marche"
risorgimento.534.d: "With a declaration from Garibaldi that he intends to conquer both Rome and Venice after capturing Southern Italy, there is increased fears within Europe of what kind of movements he could inspire if he is not stopped. Recently, a delegation from Tuscany has suggested that they be allowed to enter the Papal Marche and stop Garibaldi in Naples before he can continue with his plans."
risorgimento.534.a: "We have no choice but to comply"
risorgimento.535.t: "Invasion of the Papal Marche"
risorgimento.535.d: "The French, likely forced to accept by international pressure, has conceded to our request to enter the Papal Marche. The Papal States has not taken kindly to our troops and has put up some resistance. Our troops should be able to handle them easily and then move on to the South to meet with Garibaldi's forces."
risorgimento.535.a: "Onwards!"
risorgimento.536.t: "Riots and Resistance"
risorgimento.536.d: "Following the rise of a liberal government in Tuscany with aspirations for uniting Italy, many in our nation became sympathetic to their cause. Despite hopes to eventually annex the Tuscan government into our own, the Tuscans had approached us regarding merging our governments. When we declined, an open state of war was opened between our nations. Many have taken to the streets decrying this war as an act of aggression on our part. Radical and Liberal agents alike are painting our government to be elitist and opposed to liberalization in Italy."

Duke Leopold II will serve as Head of State in a similar fashion to the United Kingdom's monarchy. This shift away from Autocracy comes just a decade after the Austrian Empire forced the Duke to repeal the Tuscan constitution, and this action brings many questions as to the future of the Italian Peninsula."

NSC_focus_1848_revolution_legacy: "Legacy of the Revolutions of 1848"
NSC_focus_1848_revolution_legacy_desc: "The revolutions of 1848 consisted of several riots and uprisings organized by liberal and Carbonari committees with the first one starting in Messina on September 1, 1847 and ending with the Sicilian revolution that culminated in an independent Sicily for 16 months before it was crushed by King Ferdinand II’s troops on May 15, 1849.\n\n Despite having forced Ferdinand to grant a new, more liberal constitution, it all fell apart when the members of the chambers of deputes couldn’t agree on what oath that should be taken. This gave the king an excuse to dissolve the national parliament and crush all uprisings. Since the King has ruled as an absolute monarch, the revolutionary leaders who haven’t fled into exile has either been killed or are languishing in prison."
NSC_focus_piscane_expedition: "The Pisacane Expedition"
NSC_focus_piscane_expedition_desc: "Named after its leader, Carlo Pisacane, it was the brainchild of Giuseppe Mazzini. Its aim was to start an uprising in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and from there continue on to achieve Mazzini’s goal, a unified Italy based on Social Democratic Republicanism. In short to achieve what the revolutions of 1848 tried but failed to do However, the expedition met a bloody end when it reached Campania and failed to get the support of the local population. Pisacane himself died in the small town of Sanza, it is unclear if he committed suicide or was killed by the inhabitants."
NSC_focus_ferdinand_ii_reign: "The Reign of Ferdinand II"
NSC_focus_ferdinand_ii_reign_desc: "From being a fairly popular monarch in the early years of his reign he is now more known for his repressive tendencies. There is no love for the king among the liberals in his realm nor among the Sicilian inhabitants that remember the looting and raping committed by his troops. The savage shelling by a naval flotilla of the city of Messina, killing many civilians after the city had surrendered, has earned him the nickname re bomba, “King Bomb”."
NSC_focus_continue_political_arrest: "Continue Political Arrests"
NSC_focus_continue_political_arrest_desc: "It is clear after last years cowardly attempt against the king’s life and this years attempt to start an uprising in Campania that we cannot let our guard down. This, so called revolutionaries, must be hunted down. One of our top priorities is Giuseppe Mazzini tried and condemn to death, for his involvement in both attempts he is currently in hiding. He and his accomplices must be found. "

NSC_focus_strengthen_troya_government_desc: "Our trusted Prime minister, Ferdinando Troya has served us well, working hard to preserve and improve our interests. Such a loyal servant needs our full support, especially considering that his own brother, Carlo Troya, is popular among the troublemakers with his support of the Neo-Guelphism movement that wants to unite Italy and have the pope as its king!  We need to show who of the Troya brothers is the true patriot."
NSC_focus_kings_health: "The Health of the King"
NSC_focus_kings_health_desc: "Due to an assassination attempt by one of his own soldiers in 1856 the king suffered a bayonet wound that later got infected. Since then, the king’s health has never fully recovered, we can only pray that he will be better soon."
NSC_focus_secure_kingdom: "Secure the Kingdom"
NSC_focus_secure_kingdom_desc: "We have managed to keep the pressure up on the troublemakers, forcing them to go into hiding and focusing on staying alive instead of plotting against us. But there is trouble from abroad too, both France and England withdrew their ambassadors in 1856 when we, rightly, decided to follow our own path as a sovereign nation instead of listening to their advice. The most worrisome is the English hostility towards us. They seem to have forgotten the close friendship the house of Bourbon shared with them during the war against Napoleon. There are signs that they want to limit our sovereignty and take control of our Sicilian sulphur. We need to look for new allies the question is where?"

During a military review on December 8, 1856, he attacked the king with his bayonet and, hadn’t it been for the Kings pistol case deflecting the blow, he would have succeeded in ridding Italy of the tyrant.Agesilao Milano is now a martyr of the Italian cause, it will be up to others to take up the torch of a unified and free Italy!"

NSC_focus_search_political_allies_desc: "The failed Pisacane expedition made it abundantly clear that only recruiting revolutionaries among our own people won’t be enough. We need international allies that can put pressure on King Ferdinand. Luckily, we have two promising alternatives; Relations between his majesty’s government and France and the United Kingdom are not the best anymore. Napoleon III of France has showed support for Italian independence before and seem to have a soft heart for Italy while, in Britain, the former chancellor and statesman, William Ewart Gladstone, has come out against King Ferdinand’s government in quite harsh terms calling it “the negation of God erected into a system of government”. Finding sympathizers in these countries shouldn’t be too hard."

He knows how to lead armies as he showed in the crushing of the uprising in Sicily in 1849. But he also showed a liberal streak when he convinced the king to adopt the new constitution the same year, even if the king revoked it only a few months later. Filangieri has also proven himself as a prominent administrator during his time as governor of Sicily where he quickly restored law and order, paying off he debts the islands communes had accumulated during the fighting and restoring the old privileges. He wanted to address some of the islanders’ grievances by trying, and failing, to convince the king to allow a more autonomous Sicilian government. "

# Events
risorgimento.600.t: "Dissolution of the Swiss Regiments"
risorgimento.600.d: "Following a law proposed by the Swiss government which would make serving foreign militaries illegal by penalty of loss of citizenship, the Swiss regiments in our army turned to revolt. The Swiss 3rd Regiment started the revolt which eventually led to the Swiss Regiments marching towards Capodimonte to seek answers from King Francesco II. Fearing a larger riot, General Nunziante commanded the 13th Hunters Battalion to open fire on the Swiss soldiers. After this event the government has decided it best to dissolve the Swiss regiments and create separate foreign battalions for foreign troops to circumvent laws like the one in Switzerland. Though a few soldiers remain, many of the Swiss and Bavarian volunteers have left the army."
risorgimento.600.a: "What a chaotic series of events"
risorgimento.602.t: "The Ponza Island Prison Break"
risorgimento.602.d: "Over 300 prisoners have escaped from a Prison on Ponza Island after they were assisted in a prison break. Many of the prisoners were political prisoners, including many notorious figures from the revolutions of 1848. The Neapolitan authorities have since re-established order at the penitentiary and deployed the Real Marina to survey the surrounding waters for vessels that could be harboring the escaped convicts."
risorgimento.602.a: "Hopefully nothing comes of this"
risorgimento.603.t: "The Sapri Expedition"
risorgimento.603.d: "An expedition led by Mazzinian Carlo Pisacane into Sapri, Campania, has been put down. Much of the work to apprehend the criminals involved was done by the local populace. Having been informed of a prison break on the island of Ponza prior, the local peasants massacred over 20 of the conspirators and handed 150 over to the gendarmes. Following clashes with the local peasants, Piscane and the rest of his band retreated to Sanza, where they were attacked again by the local populace, losing almost 100 more men. It was there that the sub-chief of Sanza, Sabino Lavegilia, killed Piscane, while one of the other leaders of this expedition, Giovan Falcone, committed suicide.\n\n It has been said of the expedition that the populace of these towns and their city guards were incredibly brutal. Some reported cannibalism, ferocious women chasing men into the forests, and the barbarous slaughtering of the conspirators."
risorgimento.603.a: "The Mazzinians have been defeated"
risorgimento.604.t: "Riot in Genoa"
risorgimento.604.d: "Supports of Mazzini in Genoa were apprehended trying to hand out letters in support of rioting and support of the failed Pisacane expedition. Two of the leading conspirators have been identified as Jessie M. White and her boyfriend Alberto Mario. While nothing major has occurred and the riot did not spread far, Cavour has ordered the police to be on alert for any remaining Mazzinians who might challenge the Piedmont government. The conspirators who are captured are expected to be exiled, same as Mazzini once was."
risorgimento.604.a: "Mazzini continues to haunt Italy"
risorgimento.605.t: "Riot in Livorno"
risorgimento.605.d: "In support of the failed Pisacane Expedition, a riot broke out in Livorno today. Mazzinians led by Maurizio Quadrio attempted to onsite insurrection in the city. Conspirators were wearing tricolor armbands and assaulted the city garrison. Luckily, the military command was able to sound the alarm by firing three cannon shots from the Old Fortress. The riot spreaded quickly but reinforcements from the military were easily able to trap the insurrectionists that had attempted to fight on. \n\n Seven of the insurrectionists were lined up on the wall of the Colo palace, where they had attempted to hold out, and shot by order of Major Giovanni Traditi. "
risorgimento.605.a: "Mazzini continues to haunt Italy"
risorgimento.606.t: "Legacy of the Revolutions of 1848"
risorgimento.606.d: "The Revolutions of 1848 were very chaotic for our Kingdom. Our armies originally joined the Italian coalition in fighting the Austrians, but when a revolt in Palermo turned the entire island of Sicily into open revolt a response was necessary. Naples also faced a major revolt which prompted the creation of a constitution for the Kingdom, however, this did little to battle the flames of revolution and Sicily could only be calmed after our armies sieged down the cities of the island. The constitution was revoked and conservative ministers took over government positions at the behest of Ferdinand II."
risorgimento.606.a: "A Legacy not Soon Forgotten..."
risorgimento.607.t: "The Cagliari Case"
risorgimento.607.d: "Though not an original fear of our government, the capture of the Cagliari - a Sardinian ship captured in early 1857 which happened to have a crew that contained a few Brits - has caused the British Parliament to denounce our actions and side with Piedmont in their threats. The harbormasters are intent on keeping the Cagliari under condemnation, despite these new threats. We are at a dangerous position."
risorgimento.607.a: "These threats are baseless"
risorgimento.607.b: "Get the legislature to send an apology, and release the ship"

 risorgimento.9.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont"
 risorgimento.9.d: "A number of events promoted Piedmont’s prestige in Italy and abroad. In March 1854 France and England intervened in support of the Ottoman Empire against Russia in the Crimean War. To obtain Austrian support, they were prepared to guarantee the status quo in Italy. Only Piedmont was in a position to disrupt it at that time, and Cavour negotiated an alliance with the Western powers. In May he sent to Crimea an army that performed brilliantly. As a result, Piedmont was able to assume a place among the victors at the Congress of Paris (February 1856). From this platform Cavour, achieving a diplomatic coup for Piedmont and Italy, declared that the only threat to peace in Italy, and the root cause of subversive plots, was the burdensome Austrian overlordship. Cavour’s pronouncements at the congress increased the standing of Piedmont among nationalists."

Italy cannot be truly reunified unless steps are taken to ensure freedom from the meddling Austrians. Luckily, Napoleon III of France shares with us a common enemy. We should send Count Cavour to meet with him, but none must know of this. We will disguise the trip as a mere vacation to Switzerland while Count Cavour will travel on to Plombieres, where the French Emperor has agreed to meet with us. Together, the two leaders will plan an invasion of the Austrian-controlled part of our beautiful peninsula, and drive out foreign influence.

As the economies of Europe begin to shift towards Industrialization—and Piedmont along with it, the island of Sardinia has been left underdeveloped and to be exploited for resources to fuel mainland Industries. The situation in Sardinia is considered volatile by much of the Piedmontese ruling class, hampering any efforts to change the economic or political makeup of the island any further. The question remains on whether Industrialization efforts should be forwarded to the island, or if it can remain strictly a strategic installment, and be of use in other sectors of our economy."

risorgimento.700.d: "Following the Congress of Vienna, Monaco was transferred to the Kingdom of Sardinia as a protectorate. The Treaty of Stupinigi in 1817 formalized the relationship between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Protectorate of Monaco. The treaty was overall devastating for Monaco and much of the wealth of the nation was lost, which was further inflamed when a majority of the nation declared independence during the Revolutions of 1848. Since then, the areas of Roquebrune-Menton have been under the Savoy administration to cease violence in the area. As the struggle for unification is underway, many question what status Monaco will play in it. Shall Monaco be transferred to France along with Savoy and Nice in exchange for French support, or should we fight to ensure Monaco remains a part of the Italian sphere?"

Following some harsh words a small scuffle broke out between both sides. Closing the meeting off with a band, the Sardinians have presented their treaty which demans that Monaco surrender its independence in order to allow Sardinia to liberate it."

They have sent their proposed treaty which outlines Monaco remaining as a protectorate as long as their is an Italian government to defend it."

risorgimento.713.d: "The treaty of Stupinigi, signed by both the former Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars confirmed our place under the protection and oversight of Sardinia-Piedmont. The treaty distinctly specifies “This land shall never fall under a foreign government,” which was unanimously agreed upon during negotiations despite the uneasy relationship between our Royal House and the House of Savoy. Consequently, weariness over lofty taxes and blatant abuse of power has pushed Rocabrüna and Mentone, which make up over 95% of our territory, into declaring union with Sardinia-Piedmont—an action to which Sardinia wholehearted embraced and has since sent three militia brigades to enforce. The destabilization and stagnation of Monaco leaves for a generally uncertain future, however, our noble-hearted and stalwart Prince Charles III, stands firm, ready to guide our nation through any storm or sickness to come."

risorgimento.1.t: "The Crimean War"
risorgimento.1.d: "Camillo di Cavour was under orders of Victor Emmanuel when 15,000 soldiers under the command of General Alfonso La Marmora landed in Russia. The intervention in the war was in a bid to gain recognition from major nations - France especially - to assist in the issue of Italian Unification. The bravery and courage of the soldiers who fought in the Battle of the Chernaya and the siege of the Sevastapol earned Sardinia a seat at the Peace Conference, and the dream of unification was becoming a reality."
risorgimento.1.a: "Let us Remind Europe of this"
risorgimento.2.t: "Sardinian Diplomacy"
risorgimento.2.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont, the up-and-coming kingdom in Italy was, until recently, a lesser nation with little to no diplomatic power. Known only for it's failure to defeat the Austrians in the past, the entrance and performance of Sardinia in the Crimean War changed this completely. Now that the Sardinians hope to undertake steps towards unification, they have been insistent that Europe not forget their actions in this war."
risorgimento.2.a: "They fought well"
risorgimento.6.t: "Diplomacy with the British"
risorgimento.6.d: "Diplomacy with the British rests largely in the friendship of Camillo Benso and the British Legation in Turin - James Hudson. James Hudson himself is quite the italophile, and his position in Turin - held since the days before Benso was prime minister - has convinced him of the need of support for the unification movement. Though he faces some ridicule at home for his position as a favorable ally of Camillo Benso, he will be a key instrument for Sardinia in the attempts to get British support for unification."
risorgimento.6.a: "Tell Hudson that Cavour needs to see him"
risorgimento.7.t: "Diplomacy with Sardinia"
risorgimento.7.d: "James Hudson - the British Legation to Sardinia-Piedmont - has an equal number of allies in enemies in the British Government. The Queen herself is rumored to claim he is too much a friend of the Italians than the British, but nobody in the government will tell you that he is a bad diplomat. Despite his friendship with Cavour and support for Italian unification, Hudson has always kept British interests in mind. Now that the Sardinians are looking for allies in their hopes for Unification communication between our nations is at an all time high. \n The most pressing matter for the Sardinians currently in which they hope to see our position in the case of the Cagliari - a Piedmontese mailing ship with two Brits in the crew which was captured by the neapolitans. The Case is meant to go to parliament where Sardinian officials will make their plea and the fate of British and Sardinian relations will be decided. The date of the session is set for mid-1858."
risorgimento.7.a: "Now we wait"
risorgimento.8.t: "The Cagliari Case"
risorgimento.8.d: "Despite the good relations shared between Cavour and James Hudson, much of the future of the British stake in the peninsula will come down to the Cagliari Case. The Cagliari ship was a Piedmontese mailing ship captured by the Neapolitans following the failed Sapri Expedition. The British are interested because the crew contained two Brits. The British parliament has agreed to hear the case during the Spring of 1858. It will be here that Sardinian officials will finally be able to plead their case directly to the British government. Hudson has put in his best words for our cause, but the outcome of this arrangement will be uncertain until it is over."

risorgimento.3.t: "The Cagliari Case"
risorgimento.3.d: "The Cagliari Case has reached parliament and now we wait to see how the British will rule on this matter. Camillo Benso and a few other Sardinian officials have given testimony in this case, though some sources say they have been rather arrogant about it. Nonetheless this case could prove as an important stepping stone in relations with Britain."
risorgimento.3.a: "How do they rule?"
risorgimento.4.t: "The Cagliari Case"
risorgimento.4.d: "The Cagliari Case - the case of the Sardinian ship with a crew that included a few Brits being captured by Naples - has finally reached Parliament. Though most members of Parliament are skeptical that a ruling further than a denouncement of the actions of the Neapolitans is a smart move, James Hudson has managed to convince many that an alliance with the Sardinian state would be smart and beneficial. The arrogance of the Count of Cavour in this case is not helping his position."
risorgimento.4.a: "Withdraw the case, denounce the capture of Brits"
risorgimento.4.b: "Side with Piedmont"
risorgimento.5.t: "England Withdraws the Case!"
risorgimento.5.d: "The British Parliament has withdrawn the Cagliari Case and has not made any statement in our support. Out of fears that a war would come out of this case, many of the Earls spoke against siding with our government. Despite some strong calls in our favor, and the argument that the British have an obligation to uphold Maritime Law, they remain unconvinced."

This ruling comes even after skepticism from many of the Earls, but thanks to the efforts of Hudson and our other allies in parliament. This will allow us to open up further cooperation between our governments."

A friend of both Napoleon III and Cavour, he has brought news that the French are seeking an alliance with our nation against the Austrians in order to finally remove them from the Italian Peninsula and support our cause for unification. The Orsini Affair is likely to have increased the urgency for the French to take a side in the Risorgimento, and it seems that have made the correct choice of siding with us."

However, Nigra informed Henri of an already existing alliance between Russia and Sardinia-Piedmont which is now cause for concern in the French leadership.

risorgimento.66.d: "It is expected that the French alliance will not be concluded should we refuse to concede some degree of territory coveted by the french. It is expected that the French Empire will seek to gain Nice and Savoy. Having previously occupied them briefly during the Napoleonic Wars, French authorities are well aware that without said territories, southern France will be left with a broad breach in its geographical defensibility. While Sardinia-Piedmont’s ruling class believes in the principles of nationalism, in which Savoy would undisputedly belong to the French nation, Nice, however, has long since been a core Italian land. The loss of Nice would be an evident circumstantial dismissal of our core principals, and would likely infuriate the Piedmontese populace. Additionally, Napoleon III insists on the marriage of Prince Napoleon Bonaparte and Victor Emanuel II’s eldest daughter, Maria Clotilde, to solidify our alliance. Prince Napoleon has an egregious reputation of partying and other lewd activities, and would surely mistreat Maria. The King is not eager to see the marriage go through, but is prepared to make the sacrifice for Italy."

The memory of having been defeated by the Austrians alongside our Italian allies in 1848 still lingers in the minds of many of Europe's upper classes, affording us much difficulty in voicing our ambitions to the European powers of the world stage. Our participation in the Crimean war assured the grievance of Italian Unification would become a topic of debate amongst European circles once again. The upcoming Plombieres arrangement with Emperor Napoleon III of the French Empire provides us with the opportunity to align France under our ambitions to expel Austria from influencing Italy and our long standing goal of uniting the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia with our own.

It is expected for Napoleon to arrive in front of Cavour’s cottage by the afternoon in a carriage, in which the two statesmen will take a stroll through the quiet streets of Plombières discussing the terms of the anticipated alliance.

Napoleon has made clear his determination to support Sardinia-Piedmont with all his strength under the single condition that the war against Austria would not be fought for revolutionary cause, and can be justified in diplomatic terms. The obvious contenders for proposal in order to sooth Napoleon's concerns are that of Austria’s consistent violation of trade treaty obligations, which may be too weak a justification for a use of aggression; as well as that of the Austrian garrison in Bologna, to which the Papacy has not permitted to indefinitely reside. While the garrison in Bologna may prove a sufficient justification and gain favor among other European powers, French troops are currently stationed in Rome, and the parallels may raise the question of French hypocrisy."

However, neither are suitable to use in order to wage a war of the scale we need to. The proposed casus belli's being enforcing trade treaty obligations, and using the Bologna Garrison by the Austrians as an excuse for war. With the parallels between our troops in Rome and the Austrians in Bologna, using that as a casus belli could be seen as hypocritical. The trade treaty obligations would not be strong enough to be seen as legitimate cause for war."

Using the fact that Duchy of Medna and Reggio leader Francis V had refused to accept Napoleon III as the true ruler of France. If the Modense citizens were to request protection from their Austrian-Allied government it would give Sardinia-Piedmont the perfect opportunity to make a statement about Austrian influence in the Italian Peninsula without directly going to war. The outrage in Vienna might just be enough to cause them to go to war."

However, it has transpired that Napoleon has an alternative proposal that he believes could prove a sufficient justification. Using the recent debacle in which the Duke of Modena and Reggio, Francis V refused to recognize Napoleon III as the true ruler of France. If the modenese citizens were to request protection from their Austrian-allied government, it would give Sardinia-Piedmont the perfect opportunity to make a public announcement denouncing Austrian oppression in the peninsula. The subsequent outrage the proclamation might cause just may be enough to cause them to declare themselves the aggressor."
risorgimento.98.a: "Ingenious!"
risorgimento.99.t: "Political Structure of Italy"
risorgimento.99.d: "The geopolitical makeup of Italy, should the war against Austria prove successful, is a point of tension between Sardinia-Piedmont and the French Empire, and may cause a degree of political fracturing within the alliance after the war’s completion. The French maintain the goal of gaining influence across the peninsula through the means of an Italian Confederation, reminiscent of that of which operates in germany. This directly opposes the voter-backed agenda that has become popularized throughout much of Sardinia-Piedmont, advocating for the complete removal of Foreign influence from Italy. Consequently, Sardinia-Piedmont conversely harbors the goal of creating a Northern Italian Kingdom within said confederation, should it’s nationalistic agenda prove unfruitful."

Naturally, we can always give the French our assurances now and see if the future allows us to change the agreement, but we are not in a good position to deny the French goal of domination in Italy. With that, we are stuck in this position with the hope to escape at first chance, or at the very least to renegotiate the terms of the confederation."

This would see Austria entirely removed from the Italian peninsula and the creation of a new powerful Independent Italian state."
risorgimento.101.a: "Interesting..."
risorgimento.102.t: "Central Italy"
risorgimento.102.d: "Central Italy would be reorganized under the rule of Roberto I, Duke of Parma. Roberto, being an adolescent, currently entrusts state legislation with Louise Marie Thérèse d'Artois as acting regent. France clearly believes that Louise d’Artois may be more akin to following a policy of clienthood with the French Empire due to her francophone upbringing. This new Central Italian Kingdom would be awarded with the former Duchy of Tuscany, as well as the Marche and Umbrian former Papal Legislations. The Pope, in compensation, would be nominated honorary head of the confederation, not that the Papacy has much of a choice."

risorgimento.104.t: "The South of Italy"
risorgimento.104.d: "A fair degree of uncertainty came with discussions on the South of the peninsula. More likely than not, it would remain under the rule of the Bourbon monarchs of the Two Sicilies. However, it is unclear whether or not the Bourbon rulers would be open to the idea of confederation. Should they be unable to be convinced of the merits of Neapolitan integration into the proposed confederation, it is almost assured that the Two Sicilies would be awarded to a Bonapartist relative of Napoleon III."

risorgimento.106.t: "Military Composition"
risorgimento.106.d: "The first and foremost topic of the day, which perhaps might be the most dire, is that in regards to the military composition of the alliance. Given the war is over Italian soil, Cavour understands that having Sardinia-Piedmont lead the Entente forces in the conflict would constitute a symbolic vengeance for the defeat in 1848. However, the French consider it important that they show dominance in Italy, and use the war as a political ploy for vengeance over the Congress of Vienna’s terms. Whoever leads the military alliance will gain quite the sum of political utility post-war."

As the dominant power in Europe compared to the Italians it would be more appropriate for us to lead the armies in Italy, however, the Italians are very nationalistic people and the presence of strong Italian leaders could pay off to rally the populace and inspire troops.

With our generals at the helm, the armies of Austria will be easily crushed, and the Hapsburgs shall be removed from the Italian Peninsula once and for all!"
PIE_FRA_Plombieres_France_War: "It is of little surprise, but the French have declined our request to lead the military composition of our joint force. The French have the benefit of being a recognized power in Europe, so despite our performance in the Crimean War they have opted to use their generals in most of the command positions. Despite this, our joint force shall have no difficulty removing the Austrian menace from the peninsula."

There are many reasons as to why the King has been hesitant. The Emperor's brother is not known for his loyalty to companions, and his age difference between the King's daughter is not to be ignored. It would not be a prestigious marriage in regards to Sardinia-Piedmont’s standing, but the King is willing to make the sacrifice in order to secure the alliance."

Despite some minor protest from the Italian side, they have relunctantly agreed to host the marriage in Turin at a later date. With that the alliance with Sardinia-Piedmont is sealed."
PIE_FRA_Plombieres_Marriage_Denied: "The Italian Side has reacted quite violently at the previously discussed marriage between Napoleon's cousin Louis and the daughter of King Victor Emmanuel. Citing the difference in age, and Louis' reputation, the Italians have requested that this ceremonial seal of our alliance be cast aside.

In particular, as of recent, Austria’s extortion of Francis V of Modena’s refusal to accept Napoleon III as the rightful emperor of France.

These States, together with the addition of Venetia, which is to remain firmly in Austrian hands, will be conjoined in an “Italian Federation” overseen by Austria and France. In compensation, Napoleon III has halfheartedly agreed to allow us annexation of Parma, beside Lombardy. This peace both assures the continuity of foreign domination over Italy, and leaves us in a position of vulnerability to which the continuation of the Risorgimento seems unlikely.

Since the outbreak of the war the central states largely came under control of Italian revolutionaries and saw Sardinian troops occupy much of the land. Foreign nations insist that the preexisting governments and borders be reinstated, however there seems to be little chance of this due to a lack of enforcement.

We are left in an unfavorable position. The loss of control over our Italian policy has culminated with Sardinia-Piedmont threatening to gain the entirety of the central Italian states, to which they have arranged a provisional government in, and currently occupy. Furthermore, prolonged conflict leaves us with the risk of Prussian opportunistic intervention along the Rhine. Napoleon has gone ahead and signed an alternate agreement with the Austrian’s in the town of Villafranca. Lombardy shall be rightfully ceded to Sardinia-Piedmont, but nothing more. It was agreed that the rulers of Parma, Modena, and Tuscany would be restored to their respective thrones.

This presents us with a unique opportunity, Sardinia-Piedmont has a natural hatred for the Austrians, and now the French have cast aside the Sardinians' favor.

With this change in opinion, the position of the international powers on this issue has staunchly turned against French demands.

risorgimento.151.a: "Let us prepare"
risorgimento.152.t: "The Galicia Conference"
risorgimento.152.d: "With the war against the Russo-Sardinian alliance concluded, the powers of Europe have decided that a conference must be held to avoid our general collapse. With Sardinia-Piedmont taking our Italian territory and Russia hoping to gain Galicia, the power balance of Europe is threatened. At this conference we will not hold much power as the losing side, but we can make the best case possible."
risorgimento.152.a: "May we be spared"
risorgimento.908.t: "Santo Stefano Prison Revolt"
risorgimento.908.d: "Following the exit of most of the garrison to defend the homeland, the prison island Santo Stefano of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies has been declared to be an independent republic following a riot by prisoners. The nearly 800 prisoners easily overtook the remaining 40 guards and the two groups seemingly formed a junta together called the \"Commission for Good Order.\" The community has apparently created a statute and has also formed a functioning senate. \n\n Rumors also come from the island of the judicial system in place in the former prison island. Pasquale Urso was sentenced to 50 beatings and 30 days of isolation for stealing flour, Antonio Margiotta for stealing timber and grapes from a vineyard on the island. Margiotta was forced to run around the island with the stolen goods tied around his body. As if things couldn't be any stranger, the Republic of Santo Sefano has also begun handing out death sentences for some who do not uphold the statute. Giuseppe Sabia was guilty of stealing a goat. He was found in the cemetery of the island roasting the goat. He was stabbed to death on the spot and his body thrown off a cliff."
risorgimento.908.a: "What?"
risorgimento.153.t: "Sardinian-Piedmont Declines Alliance"
risorgimento.153.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont has declined our offer for an alliance against Austria. While they maintain that they would appreciate our assistance by distracting the Austrian army, they fear that an official alliance would lessen the chance of a different power backing their cause. Though this is disappointing, many ministers are still glad to have the chance to get back at Austria for their betrayal in the Crimean War."
risorgimento.153.a: "Unfortunate"
risorgimento.83.c: "Decline the full alliance, but ask for more minor assistance"
risorgimento.154.t: "The Start of the Galicia Conference"
risorgimento.154.d: "The nations of Europe have sent their delegates to the Galicia Conference to determine the future of the territory. The conference, which is officially being hosted by Sardinia-Piedmont, has been called following the capture of Galicia by Russian troops in the Austro-Sardinian war. Many European politicians feared that with the loss of Italian holdings, combined with the potential gain of Galicia by the Russians, the Austrian Empire will not be able to remain intact. The delegates at this conference will hear the case made by Russia as to what they believe they should take, and it will be the Russian plan that is voted on."
risorgimento.154.a: "Let us begin"
risorgimento.155.t: "Our Proposal to the Conference"
risorgimento.155.d: "The time has come for us to make our case to the nations of Europe for the future of Galicia. From our options - annexing a bordering state, annexing a bordering state with the addition of the land of the old Grand Duchy of Krakow that Austria controls, or the complete annexation of Galicia - there is much deliberation to be made. The Italians will be certain to back our position no matter the proposals, and France will also have good reason to see Austria weakened as much as possible. As for the other nations they may be more reserved in allowing us to carve up so much territory, especially with the Crimean War fresh in the minds of these politicians. Anyway, they are expecting our proposal."
risorgimento.155.a: "West Galicia"
risorgimento.155.b: "East Galicia"

risorgimento.155.e: "More Options"
risorgimento.156.t: "Russian Delegation Proposes Annexation of West Galicia"
risorgimento.156.d: "The Russian delegation of the Galicia Conference has proposed that Russia should annex a section of Galicia that directly borders them. Many of our delegates are surprised by the seemingly recreant proposal from the nation that had entered the war in the hopes of gaining the entirety of Galicia."
risorgimento.156.a: "An Interesting Development"
risorgimento.157.t: "Our Vote on the Russian Proposal"
risorgimento.157.d: "Following the proposal of the Russians, the time has come to cast our vote. To avoid inessential hostilities, the votes of the conference are being cast anonymously. For this reason, we have no need to fear the repercussions of our vote. The only concern is how lenient we wish to be with Russia, or how much we want to see the Austrian Empire weakened.

risorgimento.161.t: "Russian Delegation Proposes Annexation of West Galicia and Krakow"
risorgimento.161.d: "The Russian Delegation has come up with a proposal that is meant to create a balance between full annexation and minor territorial gains from Galicia. The Russians have proposed that, along with West Galicia, the land of the former Grand Duchy of Krakow (Annexed by Austria almost 15 years ago) be ceded as well. The proposal has received mix reactions from the delegates present. Some say it's the optimal deal and some claim it's an unrealistic ask of Austria to cede Krakow, as Russian claims on the area are much weaker than their claims on Galicia."
risorgimento.161.a: "A unique plan"

risorgimento.162.a: "How interesting"
risorgimento.163.t: "Russian Delegation Proposes Full Annexation of Galicia"
risorgimento.163.d: "In a very bold move, the Russian delegation to the Galicia Conference has proposed that the Russian Empire has a right for full annexation of the territory of Galicia. Citing their victory over the Austrians and long standing history of the Russophiles in the territory, the delegate's diplomatic move has left many of the other delegations surprised at the demand. Initial rumors insist that Russia will have difficulty gaining the three votes required for their proposal to be approved."

risorgimento.164.b: "No"
risorgimento.165.t: "Russian Delegation Proposes An Autonomous Galicia"
risorgimento.165.d: "The Russian delegation has proposed a plan that nobody could have expected. Their proposal is to create an autonomous nation out of the lands of Galicia. They cite the diverse political nature of Galicia and the desire to see Galician self-determination seen as reasons for the proposal. Some delegates fear that Russia will abuse the Russophiles present in the Galician political scene but many delegations find the option a means to give the Galicians a say in their future."

risorgimento.168.d: "After the counting of the anonymous votes the Russian delegation has proved their capabilities. The proposal for the future of Galicia has been approved by a majority of the nations present in the Galicia Conference.

risorgimento.169.a: "Let us see what they come up with"
risorgimento.171.t: "Assistance For Garibaldi"
risorgimento.171.d: "Given the difficulty in justifying a casus belli against the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, it would be more beneficial to stick with Garibaldi's plan and play dumb. Garibaldi plans to take some steam ships in the night and land in Sicily with his volunteers. The plan gives us the ability to deny involvement and keep our support hidden. While Garibaldi advances from the South, we can take the opportunity to advance from the North."
risorgimento.171.a: "Turn a blind eye"
risorgimento.172.t: "The Departure"
risorgimento.172.d: "Garibaldi and his army of the thousand have departed from Genoa in the steamboats Piemonte and Lombardo. The official story will naturally be that Garibaldi and his men stole the ships for their crusade. [ROOT.GetLeader] is still nervous of French reaction to the expedition and the risk that Garibaldi goes off course."
risorgimento.172.a: "Let us hope this trip goes well"
risorgimento.173.t: "Garibaldi Stops in Talamone"
risorgimento.173.d: "Supposedly due to a lack of gunpowder, Garibaldi and his expedition have stopped in the Tuscan coastal town of Talamone to resupply. From the old fort there he was able to recover ammunition, three old cannons, and a hundred rifles from the Sardinian garrison in the fort."
risorgimento.173.a: "Good news"
risorgimento.174.t: "Garibaldi Stops at Porto Santo Stefano"
risorgimento.174.d: "Garibaldi and his expedition have again made a stop while on the trip to Sicily. This time in Porto Santo Stefano, Capital of Monte Argentario. He obtained arms and coal under an official license due to his title of major-general of the Royal Army. \n\n Despite the seemingly necessary nature of the stop, reports are developing of another reason for the stop. According to local reports Garibaldi ordered his colonel Callimaco Zambianchi and 64 of the volunteers to leave the expedition in an attempt to cause an insurrection in the Papal States."
risorgimento.174.a: "What is he thinking?!"
risorgimento.175.t: "The Papal Insurrection"
risorgimento.175.d: "Colonel Callimaco Zambianchi was able to recruit 200 men from the region to reinforce the 64 volunteers that joined him. After bolstering his force, Zambianchi began looting in the Papal States before being met by pontifical Colonel Georges de Pimodan and his riflemen. Much to our disappointment the Papal troops were assisted by local peasants and Zambianchi was forced to retreat.\n\n Our government now fears the reaction of France, an ally of the Papal States. We have ordered a ship to sail to Tuscany and arrest Zambianchi, who claims Garibaldi's plan was to convince the Bourbons to leave Sicily undefended in defense of Abruzzo."
risorgimento.175.a: "This is a disaster!"
risorgimento.176.t: "The Expedition Lands in Marsala"
risorgimento.176.d: "Following an unusual route, and avoiding the original landing spot in Sciacca, Garibaldi has landed in Marsala. Though not getting the reaction from the populace he expected, there has been little resistance to the initial landing. Officially [ROOT.GetLeader] has joined the European nations in denouncing Garibaldi as a bandit, but in reality, we hope Garibaldi is able to have success in Sicily."
risorgimento.176.a: "Onwards to Palermo!"
risorgimento.909.t: "The Expedition of the Thousand"
risorgimento.909.d: "Garibaldi and his Expedition of the Thousand have landed in Sicily in a war of \"liberation\" against the Bourbon Kingdom of Two Sicilies. Though other Italian states claim not to be involved, there is little doubt that the Expedition is the next step in the Risorgimento and the greater formation of an Italian state. The Bourbon Army has been slow to respond and it seems that Garibaldi has the popular support in Sicily."
risorgimento.909.a: "Will Italy Finally Unite?"
risorgimento.177.t: "Election of Eugenio Emanuele di Savoia-Carigano"
risorgimento.177.d: "With the formation of the Central Provinces of Italy our people have chosen Prince Eugenio Emanuele di Savoia-Carigano, relative of King Victor Emmaneul II to lead the new nation and ensure the eventual annexation into Sardinia-Piedmont. With the negotiations between France and Sardinia-Piedmont still somewhat in action, some question if France might react negatively to the election."
risorgimento.177.a: "Unification is close!"
risorgimento.178.t: "Replacement of Eugenio Emanuele di Savoi-Carigano"
risorgimento.178.d: "The new United Provinces of Central Italy have elected relative of Victor Emmanuel Prince Eugenio Emanuele di Savoi-Carigano. Given the current tense negotiations with France, the King has requested that the prince step down from any position of leadership out of fear of upsetting the French who have already lost their initial proposal of a Bonaparte king of Tuscany. Victor Emmanuel instead recommends politician Carlo Bon Compagni di Mombello take control of the government of the Central Provinces until they can go through plebicites for unification."
risorgimento.178.a: "It is a rough game of politics, isn't it?"
risorgimento.179.t: "Central Provinces of Italy Elections"
risorgimento.179.d: "After a dangerous election in the new United Provinces of Central Italy of Prince Eugenio Emanuele di Savoi-Carigano, relative of King Victor Emmanuel, Sardinia-Piedmont has made the right choice in replacing him with the much more moderate politician Carlo Bon Compagni di Mombello. This development will have great impact on the ongoing Treaty of Turin negotiations."
risorgimento.179.a: "A smart move from Sardinia-Piedmont"
risorgimento.180.t: "Massacre of the Cignoli Family"
risorgimento.180.d: "News reached Turin today of the massacre of the Cignoli family by the Austrian military. During the reconnaissance prior to the battle of Montebello, an Austrian patrol found a gunpowder flask inside a home in Torricella Verzate in the South of Lombardy. The family was arrested and brought to Casteggio where Field Marshal Karl von Urban decided they would be shot. The family, ranging from ages 14-60, were shot on the side of the road and left to die, some of them left bleeding out in agony.\n\n Garibaldi's Hunters have sworn revenge against Urban and, in Turin, Cavour has began the preparations to begin a judicial inquiry."

risorgimento.181.t: "Cavour Calls on the Judiciary"
risorgimento.181.d: "After news of the Cignoli massacre reached Turin, the politicians of Sardinia-Piedmont were appalled.

risorgimento.182.a: "We must denounce these actions"
risorgimento.183.t: "Field Marshal Urban Denounced Internationally"
risorgimento.183.d: "The nations of Europe, after receiving our judicial report, have denounced the actions of Fiel Marshal Urban. Though the hopes of having him arrested are likely impossible, his repution has been ruined and may never be healed."
risorgimento.183.a: "Is it really enough?"
risorgimento.184.t: "Field Marshal Urban Denounced Internationally"
risorgimento.184.d: "After a Judicial report reached the nations of Europe sent from the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, Field Marshal Karl von Urban has been denounced by the international community. This has been due to an event now being called the Cignoli Massacre. \n\n During the reconnaissance prior to the battle of Montebello, an Austrian patrol found a gunpowder flask inside a home in Torricella Verzate in the South of Lombardy.

According to our sources over 800 Perugians joined as volunteers in the Sardinian army and the city has declared itself in revolt, governed by the so-called \"Perugian Insurrectional Committe\" The committee apparently asked representative Monsignor Luigi Giordani to ask that the Papal States abandon neutrality in the war. The committe drove him out of the city and offered it up to King Vittorio Emanuele of Sardinia. Rumors detail that the city is awaiting supplies from Tuscany that could bolster its defenses so action is required immediately."

risorgimento.188.d: "News reached the Pontif today of actions that occurred in Perugia. After the order for the Swiss troops, led by Colonel Antionie Schmidt, to advance on the city the regiment was met by a defense by the populace almost 1,000 strong. After the initial defensive line broke troops advanced into the city. The Foreign regiment proceeded to murder citizens, ignoring age and sex alike, and loot the city.

risorgimento.192.d: "After the formalized military code created by King Victor Emmanuel, there have been many military reforms suggested to the parliament.

The decree states as follows: \n\n Giuseppe Garibaldi, commander-in-chief of the national army in Sicily: at the invitation of the main citizens and that of the free municipalities of the island; considering that in time of war it is necessary that the civil and military powers are concentrated in the same hand: DECREE That he takes, in the name of Vittorio Emanuele King of Italy the dictatorship of Sicily."

risorgimento.912.d: "With much of the Bourbon forces in full retreat and the exodus of King Francis from Naples, Garibaldi has decreed that his army shall march all the way to Rome and Venice in order to unite all people of Italy. This new decree has caused much stir in the political theater of Europe as powers fear the possible fervor Garibaldi could inspire in revolutionary populaces. Some claim that the French have plans to ensure that Sardinia-Piedmont stops Garibaldi before he is able to get to Rome, but these stories have not been confirmed.

risorgimento.197.d: "The Expedition was able to land in Marsala and advance inland without much interference from the unprepared Bourbon army. After stopping in Salemi to reorganize the additional Sicilian Volunteers that joined the Expedition, Garibaldi's army advanced to the Bourbon position in a bold offensive manuever. The soldiers of the Neapolitan Hunters were no match for the accuracy of Garibaldi's Hunters and a brave bayonet counterattack. Though initially successfull, Bixio and many of the officers of the Expedition were prepared to retreat when Garibaldi himself rode to the front of the columns declaring that \"Italians, here we must die!\" Seeing the sight of Garibaldi and the morale of the volunteers, the Bourbons retreated in such a fashion that even Garibaldi was too stunned to order a counterattack."

risorgimento.198.d: "On the advance to Palermo following the battle of Calatafimi, there has been much witness to the destruction left by the retreating Bourbon Army. The disorganized column has enacted forced requisitions on townsfolk in their wake. In the town of Alcamo the column took fire from citizens who heard of Garibaldi's great victory. Rumors of the victory, and that the men of the expedition were supernatural forces, inspired the citizens of Partinico to prepare an ambush for the advancing Bourbon Army. Once in the town center the soldiers were fired upon by citizens. The soldiers managed to respond by burning down over 60 houses, robbing many, and killing some women and children. However, the Bourbon army was already weakened and refused to be stuck in the town, retreating and leaving the wounded. \n\n When Garibaldi arrived in the town he found the citizens had brutally murdered the wounded soldiers left behind. Some were killed in brutal ritualistic killings and tossed on fires of the buildings. One woman, when questioned why the bodies were not buried, responded that \"They do not deserve burial; dogs must eat them.\" "

risorgimento.201.d: "The island of Sicily has fallen completely to the Expedition of the Thousand and Garibaldi. The last Bourbon troops have signed an agreement with Medici to cease hostilities and embark to Naples. Now with Sicily tamed plans are being drawn for landings in Calabria to surround the Bourbon Army there.\n\n With the capture of Sicily many of the volunteers, now numbering in the tens of thousands, have decided to return to their homes in hopes of rebuilding. The Southern Army is still nearly 20,000 strong but the loss of many of the volunteers will be felt greatly."
risorgimento.201.a: "A Great Victory!"
risorgimento.202.t: "The Landings in Cosenza"
risorgimento.202.d: "General Stucco, assisted by troops under Antonio Plutino and more led by Giuseppe Pace, has landed in Cosenza while Nicolò Mignogna has landed with his troops in Basilicata. Bourbon General Giuseppe Ghio and his army are now entrapped between the forces of Garibaldi, now crossing to Calabria, and the volunteers to the North. The Bourbon army has been unable to answer to any of the advancements of the Southern Army. In an incredible series of events, Bourbon general Fileno Briganti was even executed by his own men who were convinced his failures to defeat the advancing armies despite numerical advantages were due to misplaced loyalties. Even more strange is that he was discovered out of uniform supposedly en route to a secret meeting with one of his superiors."
risorgimento.202.a: "A Crushing blow to the Bourbons"
risorgimento.203.t: "The Treaty of Zurich"
risorgimento.203.d: "The Treaty of Zurich signed between our nation, the French, and the Austrians is meant to finalize the agreements of the Villafranca peace we were absent from. Stipulating the return of the monarchs to the Central States, the treaty is seen unfavorably by the new La Mamora government and is not expected to be enforced in any meaningful way, at least not by ourselves."
risorgimento.203.a: "Did we really win the war?"
risorgimento.204.t: "The Status of the Central States"
risorgimento.204.d: "Despite the Treaty of Zurich outlining the return of the Central States to their respective monarchs, the lands have long since been under control of provisional governments allied to our cause since the first days of our war with Austria.. The French have not encouraged our enforcement of the treaty due to the lack of proper annexation of the Central States. This status quo has only been upset by great demands from the French that have even had other nations comment on their diplomatic strangling of our nation. \n\n The British have been adamant that the French demands are \"subversive of Italian independence.\""
risorgimento.204.a: "Something needs to change"
risorgimento.205.t: "The Return of Cavour"
risorgimento.205.d: "King Victor Emmanuel II, hopeful with the recent changes in the status quo of the Central States, has called on Cavour to return to the government and replace the lackluster government headed by La Mamora. It is expected that Cavour will begin new negotiations with the French in preparation for a proper annexation of the Central States."

risorgimento.206.t: "Bourbon Navy Defects to our Cause!"
risorgimento.206.d: "This morning, the Bourbon naval administrators surrendered the Two Sicilies naval assets to our cause under a ceasefire status. The Two Sicilies greatest asset has abandoned them, the heart of the Bourbon Kingdom lies exposed!"
risorgimento.206.a: "Sempre Avanti Italia!"
risorgimento.207.t: "Real Marina Defects to Sardinia!"
risorgimento.207.d: "Recent reports have revealed that nearly all of our operational warships have defected to the Sardinian cause, leaving the heart of our Kingdom exposed, No longer do we have a means to defend our coastlines."
risorgimento.207.a: "This is outrageous!"
risorgimento.208.t: "Insurrection in Puglia"
risorgimento.208.d: "With rampant insurrections breaking out in Foggia, Taranto, and across Puglia, the regional garrison in Bari, consisting of dragoons,has decidedly made common cause with the people, crying\"Viva la Vittorio Emanuele! Viva la Garibaldi!!\" The Neapolitan forces sent two companies of the Thirteenth Foot in response to put down the insurrectionists, but the reinforcing companies followed the example of the dragoons. In northern Puglia, the situation is no less bleak for the Bourbons. The Neapolitan forces in Foggia were ordered to leave the town, and initially appeared willing to obey, and assembled readily enough; however  just as they were about to march, they turned to fraternize with the local Lazzaroni. Seeing the region as forfeit under the current circumstances, the Neapolitan command structure in the Puglian expanse has withdrawn to Campania. The relatively well developed region has since proclaimed its union with Sardinia-Piedmont under Victor Emanuel."

risorgimento.210.t: "Reconstruction of Prismates in Alessandria"
risorgimento.210.d: "Alessandria has long been a victim to the floods of the Tanaro. Luckily, the parliament of Sardinia-Piedmont took note of the damage caused by the floods and passed a bill to reconstruct \"prismates\" to protect the fortifications of Alessandria against the floods of the Tanaro. The new bolstered defenses will afford us the ability to build safer in the city and provide security to those who had been effected."
risorgimento.210.a: "Alessandria is safer now"
risorgimento.211.t: "Annecy-Geneva Railroad"
risorgimento.211.d: "Negotiated in part by private companies and the respective parliaments of our nations, it has been determined that a railroad between Annecy and Geneva would benefit the Swiss and Savoy people greatly. Annecy is a hub for current trade between Switzerland and Sardinia-Piedmont, and so serves an important role in the economies of both cities. "
risorgimento.211.a: "A Worthwhile investment"
risorgimento.212.t: "U.S. Consular Relations Report"
risorgimento.212.d: "As of yet, the relationship between the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont and the United States of America have been generally cordial. Since the initial act of Mutual recognition in 1802 through U.S. Consular Agent François de Navoni, cooperation between our two states has vastly expanded. On February 7, 1839, the United States accepted the credentials of Count Augusto Avogadro de Collobiano as the first charge d'affaires in Washington from the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont. One year later, the United States established a legation in Turin with the first U.S. charge d'affaires presenting his credentials on September 15, 1840. U.S. involvement in the evacuation of Italian Patriots during the wars of 1848 still lingers in the memories of many Sardinian citizens, as well as the minds of the Austrian authorities. The United States, being a fervent defender of self determination and democracy, very well favors our nation. Although, it has become apparent that any direct support from the United States is unlikely, as internal strife and the ideals of manifest destiny gripe the increasingly divided young nation."
risorgimento.212.a: "Review Sardinian-American Commercial Relations."
risorgimento.213.t: "Commercial Assessment"
risorgimento.213.d: "The United States has, as of recently, grown to become a vital and lucrative partner in commerce for our kingdom. Since signing a universally amiable treaty of trade and commerce on November 16, 1838 when U.S. delegates met with King Carlo Alberto, Emanuele II’s father, our two states have enjoyed a pleasant and increasingly advantageous relationship. Shipments of cotton depart the southern states for Sardinian textile manufacturers, where the material plays a pivotal role as a prime material in the production of Piedmontese textile products. Similarly to other northern italian textiles, the textiles from our manufacturers themselves are held amongst the highest regard in the consumerist economies of the northern states. The periodical increase in demand for raw materials, especially cotton due to our ever-expanding industries, over the past couple of decades has left Sardinia-Piedmont in a state of near dependency on the lucrative cotton trade with the United States."
risorgimento.213.a: "Intriguing..."
risorgimento.214.t: "Strategic Assessment"
risorgimento.214.d: "In June of 1848, Carlo Alberto granted the U.S. docking privileges in the port town of La Spezia after intense negotiations. The United States greatly values this arrangement, seeing the continuity of its usage as a U.S. docking bay and refueling station within the Mediterranean Sea as of utmost strategic importance. Many conservative politicians in parliament see the agreement as a breach of Sardinia-Piedmont’s national security, citing that, in addition to the arrangement displaying subordination, the United States may use its preemptive advantage against us in the case of future conflict between our two states, and advocate for its immediate repeal. While it is universally understood that the United States would be understanding of our rapid change in policy and retaliation would not be a concern, withdrawing such a concession would surely strain relations with the United States, a nation widely considered to be a close confrère of our kingdom."
risorgimento.214.a: "This is a direct breach of our national security! Repeal U.S. docking permissions immediately!"
risorgimento.214.b: "We have enough enemies as is, best not to cause trouble where it isn’t due."
risorgimento.215.t: "Border Infrastructure Investments"
risorgimento.215.d: "The Sardinia-Piedmont parliament has suggested that infrastructure in the bordering areas of our nations be upgraded. National roads near the border are significantly lacking in proper maintenance and with increased traffic between our nations, whether that be trade or movement of people, an upgrade is likely in order. A joint Swiss-Sardinian project could make quick work to upgrade the existing roads."
risorgimento.215.a: "A smart investment"
risorgimento.216.t: "Treaty of Navigation and Trade with Belgium"
risorgimento.216.d: "At the suggestion of our parliament, our diplomats have opened up negotiations with Belgium for a trade treaty to be negotiated. The Belgians have been receptive of our proposals and a new treaty is expected to go into effect soon."

risorgimento.217.t: "Treaty of Navigation and Trade with Sardinia-Piedmont"
risorgimento.217.d: "Diplomats representing the government of Sardinia-Piedmont have proposed a new Treaty of Navigation and Trade between our nations. Sardinia-Piedmont has become a rising power on the European stage after their assistance aided the winning coalition in the Crimean War. Our officials have nearly finished drawing up the treaty with the Sardinian officials and it is expected to come into effect shortly."

risorgimento.218.t: "Closing of the V Legislature"
risorgimento.218.d: "Today King Victor Emmanuel announced the official closing of the fifth legislature of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont. The legislature lasted three years, ten months, and seven days, holding three sessions per article 9 of the Albertine Statute. Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, presided over the entirety of this Legislature. The elections for the VI legislature will begin soon as our legislative bodies prepare to undertake the steps necessary to get the Risorgimento underway."

risorgimento.219.t: "Our Troops in Galicia"
risorgimento.219.d: "As part of our agreement to assist Sardinia in her war against Austria, our troops will station themselves along the Galician border. The Austrians will be forced to station their own troops on the border out of fear of attack. If they call our bluff, however, it may extend the opportunity to enter Galicia and take advantage of the situation."

risorgimento.220.t: "Troops Advance into Galicia!"
risorgimento.220.d: "The Austrians tried to call our bluff that our troops were stationed near Galicia only as a distraction from the Sardinian war! To take advantage of the lack of Austrian presence our troops have advanced into Galicia and were greeted by cheers from the Russophile population. The Austrians have tried to decry our advance but given the reaction of the population and the ongoing war in Italy there is little they can do."
risorgimento.220.a: "Galicia will be liberated!"
risorgimento.221.t: "The Central Italian States"
risorgimento.221.d: "With the Galicia Conference taking the minds of Europe off of the Italian Peninsula, solving the issue of the central states will be much easier. Fears over the French taking issue with our government annexing the revolting states in Central Italy have been settled due to the focus on the Galicia conference. Any French protest will be met with no response by the other nations of Europe. We can start the process of annexation by allowing the central states to form their own government for the time being under a relative of King Victor Emmanuel."
risorgimento.221.a: "We must take this opportunity"
risorgimento.222.t: "The Status of Krakow"
risorgimento.222.d: "With the Galicia Conference concluded and borders redrawn, the status of Krakow has been brought into question. Some of our politicians have suggested handing over the city and surrounding territory to the Russians to avoid any further conflict that might occur. The people of Krakow have little loyalty to either government and may be likely to revolt if our access to Krakow is restricted."

risorgimento.913.t: "Tuscan Ambition to Unify Italy"
risorgimento.913.d: "As if the Italian Peninsula couldn't get any more chaotic, reports conclude that Tuscany has ambition to unite Italy. The once Grand Duchy of Tuscany has liberalized greatly over the past few years, culminating in a desire to see true liberty for the people of Italy. Prime Minister [TUS.GetLeader] has denounced Sardinia-Piedmont's attempt at unifying the peninsula as an eletist campaign to empower Turin's politicians and the Savoyard Dynasty behind them.\n\n The future of the Italian Peninsula, thought to be secured under Sardinia-Piedmont's control, is now less clear. Tuscany was once a great player in the European stage and it seems that history may be repeating itself. The land of the Medici's may rise to power once again, though this time as a beacon of liberalized government."
risorgimento.913.a: "Things just got complicated"
risorgimento.223.t: "Tuscany Declares War!"
risorgimento.223.d: "After proclaiming their desire to unite Italy into a truly liberal state, the Tuscan government has declared war on our nation. Though not ever considered a direct threat, the Tuscan government's liberal and republican attitudes have caused many to support them. The loyalty of many of our generals, especially Garibaldi and his troops, is being called into question. This war may determine the fate of Italy."
risorgimento.223.a: "We must win this war!"
risorgimento.224.t: "The Turin Exhibition"
risorgimento.224.d: "Following an unsuccessful exhibition in Turin in 1850, it was decided that another exhibition should be held in Turin in 1858. The innovations present in the exhibitions and fairs in Paris and London give much prestige to the minds of those respective nations. The Turin Exhibition included many public industrial representatives, showing off work done by Cavour over the last decade to increase the industrial capabilities of Piedmont. However, despite the impressive changes since 1858, it is still evident that Italy is struggling to implement innovations already present in Europe into the industrial sector. King Victor Emmanuel and Cavour were seen together during the exhibition."
risorgimento.224.a: "Someday, we will reach greatness"
risorgimento.225.t: "An Interesting Opportunity"
risorgimento.225.d: "A possible opportunity has come to the table as the plans for supporting Italian Unification are being developed. Discussion that Russia could put troops on the border of Galicia to distract the Austrian army have brought up suggestions that the same could be done in the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldova. Facilitating an arms deal with the principalities may lead the Austrians to fear an invasion from the East, distracting more of their army. The decision will have to be made if we should attempt this so the arms can be sent right away should the principalities accept."

risorgimento.226.t: "A Proposition from France"
risorgimento.226.d: "The French Government has offered as an interesting deal. They are hoping to facilitate an arms deal with our nation in order to alarm the Austrians. The French hope that by sending us weapons the Austrians will send more of their army east, distracting them from the western front should war start. Though the French arms would certainly be useful, some are hesitant to accept should Austria not take kindly to the deal going through."

risorgimento.227.a: "Hopefully this works"
risorgimento.228.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Declines the Deal"
risorgimento.228.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] declined our offer for arms, likely fearing that facilitating the deal would harm relations with Austria. Though unfortunate that the deal could not be made, many in our government saw the offer as a waste of our resources anyway."
risorgimento.228.a: "Oh Well"
risorgimento.229.t: "Danubian Principalities Strike a Deal with France"
risorgimento.229.d: "Our diplomats recently discovered that the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldova have accepted arms shipments sent from France. This has caused concerns that the French have managed to convince the Romanian states to join the war in Italy. It may be wise to maintain troops on the border of the principalities in order to safeguard against a possible attack from this front."

risorgimento.230.t: "Maria Adelaide and Duca di Genova arrive in La Spezia"
risorgimento.230.d: "With Carlo Alberto and Vittorio Emanuele’s two sister ships finally docking into Piedmontese harbors, the original accord signed with the United Kingdom in 1853 has now been entirely fulfilled, marking a notable milestone in Sardinian Maritime Re–armament. The four frigates will form the backbone of the Sardinian navy until more formidable models can be commissioned."
risorgimento.230.a: "They will make foreboding flagships for the Regia Marina!"
risorgimento.231.t: "Maritime Assets"
risorgimento.231.d: "The urgent exigency for modern steam or other screw-driven vessels to substitute the since antiquated models of the Sardinian fleet has become ever apparent to the Sardinian legislature since Cavour’s inauguration in 1850. Efforts to revitalize the maritime capabilities of Sardinia-Piedmont by the Cavour cabinet have been substantial, with many preeminent warships being added to Sardinia’s minimal array of naval assets. As acting Minister of the Navy, in 1853 Cavour signed a series of accords with the United Kingdom including a variety of orders for vessels to be constructed in the United Kingdom for the Sardinian fleet, including that of four advanced screw-propeller driven steam frigates. Two of these vessels have since been commissioned in the Regia Marina."
risorgimento.231.a: "Il Mar Tirreno è nostro a governare!"
risorgimento.232.t: "State of the Economy"
risorgimento.232.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont has come a long way since Camillo Benso di Cavour’s appointment in 1850. Cavour immediately began work on constructing a modern economy for the nation- Closing excessive monasteries, reducing the amount of benefices, and correcting the nation's lopsided spending deficit. In order to finance major public works projects and extensive industrial expansion, as well as to pay off war indemnities to Austria acquired after the war of 1848, Cavour masterfully floated vast internal and international loans, particularly from France and the United Kingdom. The subsequent subsidization of private railway companies and Sardinia-Piedmont diverse artisan-based Industrial sectors has led to the nation’s rise to becoming the most advanced and modern state within the Italian peninsula."
risorgimento.232.a: "We must continue to strengthen the economy"
risorgimento.233.t: "Infrastructural Developments"
risorgimento.233.d: "Sardinia-Piedmont began subsidizing broad rail projects in the mid 1840s, connecting many major economic sectors throughout the nation such as Genoa and Turin, which in-turn lowered the cost of the transport of goods and persons, as well as provided a broad array of occupations to support middle class Piedmontese citizens.Cavour’s cabinet has identified connecting Turin to French and Swiss economic centers, such as Geneva and Lyon as of primary economic concern."

risorgimento.235.d: "As part of the Copenhagen Convention, which granted free passage to European shipping companies through the Sound Dunes, European nations whose shipping companies would benefit from the convention were inclined to pay certain fees.

risorgimento.240.d: "Our Parliament recently negotiated a new postal convention in cooperation with the Duchy of Modena. This new accord is expected to improve the promptness of the flow of international mail between our two states due to the removal of prior inflated bureaucracy regarding the traversal of merchandise.

The proposed Bourbon provisional government as indicated by Neapolitan general Floras, commander of Neapolitan forces in Puglia, has since reported the complete rejection of Bourbon administration by the local Lazzaroni. The four hundred gendarmes ordered to garrison the capital city of Potenza at first appeared to yield to the imposing popular manifestation, but directly afterwards, at the cry of \"Long live the King! and Death to the Nation!\" set up by Captain Castagna, they fought futilely against the insurrectionist forces, but were repulsed and fled, leaving seven dead, three wounded, and fifteen prisoners to the rebel Lucanians.

Although the Neapolitan generals had 16,000 soldiers stationed in the toe of Italy prepared to apprehend Garibaldi upon his crossing of the straight, they put up little resistance and many submitted without firing a shot; one battalion surrendered to six wandering garibaldini who had got lost. According to witness accounts from Naples, the Neapolitan minister of war announced the following morning that he was departing for Calabria to defeat Garibaldi and retake Reggio, but then changed his mind that same afternoon due to considerations of his presence in the capital being essential to prevent disorder."

risorgimento.250.t: "The Revolutions of 1848"
risorgimento.250.d: "In 1848, many revolutions struck Italy, notably having started at the autonomous city of Palermo in Sicily. Separatist movements promoted the separation of Sicily from Naples, and adopting a more liberal government. The former of which was quickly suppressed by the king, but the latter was accepted and Ferdinand II of Two Sicilies became the first of many to support a liberal constitution. Others quickly followed, including Leopold II of Tuscany, Charles Albert of Sardinia-Piedmont, and Pope Pius IX of the papacy.\n\nThe Austrian government thought otherwise, as they did not yield to the pressure for liberal reform in their Italian holdings. Instead, garrisons had reinforced the borders of Lombardy-Venetia and had opposition leaders arrested in Venice and Milan. Only a few days later, a sudden wave of revolutionary insurgents swept across the Austrian Empire while Venetian and Milanese insurgents moved to depose their Austrian overlords. Within only a few days, the Austrian army retreated, and nearly all of Lombardy-Venetia was in control of the revolutionaries. It took a matter of months for the Austrian Empire to retake control of the state from the rebels and left a scar that will cripple the empire for years to come."

risorgimento.251.t: "The Failure of 1848"
risorgimento.251.d: "Calamitous discord had swathed across European soil, and the Austrian Empire had suffered the worst in its Italian land of Lombardy-Venetia. More importantly, King Charles Albert had conceded to the liberals, who aimed to establish a constitutional monarchy. Following the transition, he would go on to march his army into Austrian territory to support the rebels in Venice and Milan. His army was joined by soldiers from the then liberalized governments of Duke Leopold II in Tuscany, King Ferdinand in the Two Sicilies, and volunteers from Sicily and the Papal States. Despite some success in the dawn of his campaign, King Charles’ army would later be defeated at the Battle of Custoza, forcing a humiliating armistice until peace negotiations could be made. The defeat saw all the liberal governments, with exception to Sardinia-Piedmont, crumble to the Austrian demand for the renouncement of constitutions and the confirmation of absolutism."
risorgimento.251.a: "That brings us to now..."
risorgimento.252.t: "Rally against the Austrians"
risorgimento.252.d: "The Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont stands as the last independent Italian state, still refusing to succumb to Habsburg influence. The southern Kingdom of Two Sicilies has married into the Habsburg Empire, Venezia has been given to the Austrians after the Congress of Vienna, and the smaller states are under Austrian protection. Our people support a strong and powerful government centered around our king, who vows to fulfill the dreams of a united Italy. As we stand as a barrier between the Austrian and French spheres, if we play our cards right, perhaps we can tumble the Austrian tower of cards."
risorgimento.252.a: "Our time has come"
risorgimento.253.t: "The Protectorate of Monaco"
risorgimento.253.d: "The Congress of Vienna had transferred the protection of Monaco from the French to Piedmont via the Treaty of Stupinigi, as well as full dominion over the state. The treaty states, “This land shall never fall under a foreign government,” which was unanimously agreed upon in negotiations, despite an uneven relationship between our king and the King of Monaco. With the people, we are feared, as we have sent many garrisons to destabilize and annex parts of the Principality."
risorgimento.253.a: "More things to handle..."
risorgimento.254.t: "Long Live Italia!"
risorgimento.254.d: "Traveler and influential writer, Maxime Du Camp has written many wondrous novels of his times in Italy, including his participation in Giuseppe Garibaldi's Expedition of the Thousand. Maxime writes of hearing the loud crowds of Naples, following the plebiscites, shouting, “Long live Italy!” Afterwards, many members of the crowd asked him what “Italy'' was, as Italy had been nothing more than a geographical region after the fall of the Romans and the split into a multitude of smaller Italian states. Not the mention many of the Southern Italians lack any formal education."
risorgimento.254.a: "How Embarrassing"
risorgimento.255.t: "Warrior Queen of the Two Sicilies"
risorgimento.255.d: "The Germanic queen to Francesco II of Two Sicilies, Queen consort Maria Sophie of Bavaria, has demonstrated her valor in the heat of battle. General Garibaldi's Expedition of The Thousand has proven well for our cause in unifying Italy under one banner, but his march on Naples was obstructed by the fortress of Gaeta. In the midst of the siege, the Sicilian queen was witnessed benevolently supporting her soldiers, caring for the wounded, and even taking up arms with them. Her bravery is admired by the Piedmontese people. Regina guerriera; Warrior Queen!"
risorgimento.255.a: "Though they have lost, they fought till the end"
risorgimento.256.t: "October Campaign Massacre"
risorgimento.256.d: "General Cialdini of the Northern Army has been advancing south for quite some time now, during his so-called October Campaign after the capture of Campania and garrisoning the two cities of Pontelandolfo and Casalduni. The murder of 45 Piedmontese garrisons angered Cialdini, causing him to single out and execute Pro-Bourbonist soldiers and civilians. What has been most embarrassing for the national government is his ruthlessness and lack of prudence in determining whether or not the victims truly supported bourbonism. A humiliation for the Italian people, murdering our own."
risorgimento.256.a: "The war will be over shortly..."
risorgimento.257.t: "Nizzardo-Exodus"
risorgimento.257.d: "Concomitantly and following the annexation of Nice and its surroundings from the Kingdom of Sardinia to France, in application of the agreements signed between the governments of our two countries during the Second Italian War of Independence. It has become an evident consequence, that an estimated quarter of the Nizzardi population in Nice, especially those of higher class stature have relocated to many Piedmontese towns and communes. While French authorities have dismissed the mass-migration as primarily an issue of retaining Sardinian citizenship, educated classes across Europe can evidently infer the migrations are a direct ramification of forced Francization favored and imposed by French authorities in the region. The rapid abandonment of the native-Italian region is surely a symbolic milestone in the erasure and demographic acclimatization of the historic expanse. Opposition to the French Authority is steadily on the rise after initial street skirmishes with French law enforcement."
risorgimento.257.a: "A price needed to be paid..."
risorgimento.258.t: "Promotions in the Military"
risorgimento.258.d: "As a war with Austria looms on the horizon, Victor Emmanuel and members of the military leadership have recommended promotions be handed out to officers in the army and navy who will need to adopt leadership roles in the coming wars. Many officers have proved themselves worthy of a promotion and many more may prove their worth in the upcoming war."
risorgimento.258.a: "Welcome to our new Generals and Admirals"
risorgimento.259.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Breaches the Western Quadrilatero"
risorgimento.259.d: "The Forces of Sardinia-Piedmont have breached the western portion of the Quadrilatero. This decisive defeat on our part leaves us no choice but to go to the negotiating table before they are able to push futher into Veneto. It is unclear whether or not the Russians will immediately gain anything from the peace but rumors have spread that a European Conference will deterimine the fate of Galicia following the end of the war."
risorgimento.259.a: "This is a great shame"
risorgimento.260.t: "Russia Captures Major Towns of Galicia"
risorgimento.260.d: "The Russians have captured our major towns and cities of the Galicia Region. With this news, our military leaders have demanded that we negotiate a peace immediately. Allowing the Russians to push further into our lands would weaken our West for the Italians to push even further into Lombardy-Venetia. The presence of Russian troops any further inside of our territory may also inspire revolt in areas of the Empire that are not under our control."
risorgimento.260.a: "We have no choice..."
risorgimento.261.t: "Victory against Austria!"
risorgimento.261.d: "Through the combined efforts of our forces and those of Sardinia-Piedmont, the Austrians have agreed to come to the negotiating table. Sardinia-Piedmont is leading the negotiations and rumors are spreading that a European Conference may be held to handle the future of Galicia and ensure that the Austrian Empire does not totally collapse."
risorgimento.261.a: "A Great Victory!"
risorgimento.262.t: "The Annexation of the Two-Sicilies"
risorgimento.262.d: "The Plebiscites of the Sicilian and Neapolitan provinces have concluded. The people were asked one simple question: "Do the people want Italy, One and Indivisible, with Constitutional King Vittorio Emanuele and his legitimate descendants?" The results were overwelmingly in favor of unification and the courts of the Neapolitan and Sicilian provinces announced the results of the votes to cheering crowds.\n\nInteresting to note about these plebiscites is that for possibly the first time in history a woman has voted in an Italian vote. Patriot Marianna De Crescenzo was given special permission from the Electoral President to cast a ballot, and she did so to the sounds of cheers from her fellow patriots."
risorgimento.262.a: "Viva L'Italia!"
risorgimento.263.t: "The Procession Begins"
risorgimento.263.d: "The Royal Procession for the opening of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy is about to begin. Soon Italy will be legally united as one nation. Against all odds and assumptions Sardinia-Piedmont and her people stand triumphant. Though many challenges await the new nation, this is a time of much celebration across the peninsula."
risorgimento.263.a: "We must prepare"
risorgimento.264.t: "Italian National Exhibition of [GetYear]"
risorgimento.264.d: "Following the Unification of Italy, Victor Emmanuel and other politicians were hoping to for a show of the might of the new Italian Nation. Talented Scientist and former Finance Minister Quintino Sella commissioned the Italian National Exhibition which took place in Florence. Using the Stazione Leopolda as a base, the exhibition will run for multilpe months. Over 8,000 exhibitors are expected to show off the best of the best Italy has to offer in the fields of the arts, sciences, agriculture, and Italian industries. Most impressive so far has been the display from the agriculture field and the magnificant gardens put forward by some of those benefactories."
risorgimento.264.a: "What a great showcase of the Italian Nation!"
risorgimento.265.t: "The Gattini Massacre"
risorgimento.265.d: "In Matera, Basillicata Count Francesco Gattini and two of his collaborators have been massacred by a crowd of pro-Bourbon peasants. The peasants, angered that the promised policy of return of state-owned land to the people was being delayed by the count, surrounded the Count and his collaborators outside his palace. Despite the Count seemingly giving in to some of their demands and signing away many of his possessions, the Count angered the crowd when he went on his balcony and threw silver coins to the crowd, shouting "eat, turkeys, the demans are yours." The people then stormed the palace and captured the Count and his men. The crowd took the men to the Piazza del Sedile in Matera and killed them with a scythe overlooking the square, accusing them of having taken possession of the state-owned lands intended for the population. Many of the conspirators have been captured and some were sentenced to death, leaving one final cry of "long live 'u Rè" in support of Francis II."
risorgimento.265.a: "There is Still Much Chaos in the South"
risorgimento.266.t: "The Revolt of Montemiletto"
risorgimento.266.d: "As troops begin to enter Campania, reports have been recieved of a revolt breaking out in Montemiletto and the surrounding areas. The area was initially taken control by liberals part of the Ariano insurrection. Following this, local peasants, led by a few pro-Bourbon officers, armed themselevs and began attacking various liberal sympathizers. Giuseppe Fierimonte, a local liberal leader, and his allies were attacked at his palace and placed upon telegraph poles. In the end, around 30 liberals were killed throughout the area before soldiers from Garibaldi's army made their way into the towns. Though a judicial court was set up to put the Bourbon agitators to justice, most have fled into the surrounding mountains and forest."
risorgimento.266.a: "These Pro-Bourbon Peasants are Becoming an Issue"
risorgimento.267.t: "Rebel Groups Form in the South"
risorgimento.267.d: "Following the events of the revolt in Montemiletto, different elements of the legitimist population and soldiers have organized into rebel groups spread throughout the countryside. These groups are supported by local pro-Bourbon populations, who create a connection between the outside world and these groups. Two key leaders in the formation of these groups (who some coin as "Brigands") are Basilio Pagliuca and Gaetano Maria Baldassarre. These movements are becoming incredibly more popular throughout the South making many wonder how stable our occupation really it."
risorgimento.267.a: "Hopefully Things Don't Boil Over"
risorgimento.268.t: "Promotion of Enrico Morozzo Della Rocca"
risorgimento.268.d: "Enrico Morozzo Della Rocca comes from a noble family of Counts in Morozzo. After graduating from the Royal Military Academy of Turin, he easily rose to high ranks. His actions in the uprisings of 1848 earned him a position in the first government of Azeglio. As the military prepares for possible action in the coming years, his name has come up for promotion to Lieutenant General."
risorgimento.268.a: "Congratulations to the Count"
risorgimento.269.t: "Fr. Giovanni Bosco Burns Protestant Bibles"
risorgimento.269.d: "Father Giovanni Bosco, a popular Turin Catholic Priest, caused some slight stir in Turin today when he burned copies of the Diodati Bible as well as anti-Catholic pamphlets. The Diodati edition of the Bible is a very commonly used translation of the Bible by Italian Protestants. Don Bosco, as he is more commonly known as, is the founder of the Salesian Religious Order and serves the poor of Turin very faithfully. His demonstration today was to show his pupils how they ought to despise heresy."
risorgimento.269.a: "I Hear it was Quite the Bonfire!"
risorgimento.270.t: "Expansion of the Consular Network in China"
risorgimento.270.d: "Riccardo Manca di Vallombrosa has just returned from a trip to the Qing Empire. He has suggested to Cavour that the consular network within the Chinese empire be expanded in order to serve the Italian silk merchants. Though initial efforts would have pointed towards setting up diplomatic efforts in Canton, the conflict between European powers and Qing have made that option void. Instead, a consulate will be opened in Shanghai, the heart of the Chinese silk trade."
risorgimento.270.a: "A Worthwhile Investment"
risorgimento.271.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Expands Consular Network"
risorgimento.271.d: "The Italian nation of Sardinia-Piedmont has sought to open a new consulate within Shanghai to serve Italian merchants participating in the silk trade. Though our nation has had relatively few encounters with the small Italian nation, our limited information of the European continent points towards a possible increase in their power as very likely."
risorgimento.271.a: "It Shall be Permitted"
risorgimento.272.t: "Establishment of a Consulate in Hong Kong"
risorgimento.272.d: "In furthering our connections to the Far East, it has been advised that our government open a consulate in Hong Kong. The consulate is be headed by Englishman John Dent and all activities are to be run through the English consulate rather than fully independently."
risorgimento.272.a: "We Must Further our Influence"
risorgimento.273.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Opens Consulate in Hong Kong"
risorgimento.273.d: "Following their opening of a consulate in Shanghai last year, the government of Sardinia-Piedmont has opened a consulate within Hong Kong. Their consulate is run by an Englishman, John Dent, who will be ensuring all actions of their consulate go through our government first."
risorgimento.273.a: "Very Well"
risorgimento.274.t: "Appointment of James Hogg to Shanghai Consulate"
risorgimento.274.d: "James Hogg, a British silk merchant, has been formally appointed to the consulate in Shanghai. His knowledge of the silk trade will hopefully aid our current Italian merchants operating in Shanghai. His first task has been to grant our nation taotai which will open relations between China and our nation."
risorgimento.274.a: "Good Luck to Him"
risorgimento.275.t: "Taotai Granted with Qing"
risorgimento.275.d: "The work of James Hogg in our consulate in Shanghai has managed to grant us Taotai, formally opening relations between our nation and the Qing empire. This will allow negotiations to open in the near future regarding signing official treaties with nations in the Far East."
risorgimento.275.a: "Great News"



risorgimento.915.t: "Sardinia-Piedmont Annexes Monaco"
risorgimento.915.d: "Following the Congress of Vienna, Monaco had been made a protectorate of Sardinia-Piedmont. The treaty of Stupinigi in 1817 formalized the relationship between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Protectorate of Monaco. The treaty was seen to be detrimental to the economy of Monaco and caused many citizens to lose trust in Prince Charles III. Ever since the Revolutions of 1848, Sardinia-Piedmont has been occupying Menton and Rocabrüna, two regions that declared unification with Sardinia-Piedmont. Now the rest of Monaco has been formerly annexed into the Sardinia-Piedmont. Many question if this was the will of the people of Monaco or the will of politicians in Turin."

risorgimento.917.d: "Carlo Pisacane, along with his band of Sicilian political prisoners and petty theives, has parished following his attempted expedition into Sapri in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Pisacane was though to have been working with Mazzinian circles to attempt to invoke an insurrection against the Bourbon monarchy in the Two Sicilies. The local peasants had been warned ahead of time of the expedition and were told that the members were raiders looking to pillage the local towns. Thanks to the propaganda from the Bourbon authorities, Pisacane and his band were immediately attacked by the locals. Despite being able to flee the initial attack, Pisacane and his remaining band were brutally slaughtered by local militia and peasants just days later, with some reports even claiming that cannabilism and other wicked activities were done to members of the expedition.\n     Following the expedition, pro-Mazzini riots broke out in Genoa and Florence before supporters were arrested. In Piedmont, supporters of the plot are rumored to be facing charges that could lead to their exile to England."
risorgimento.917.a: "The Era of Radicalism in Italy is still upon us"

# state names event
risorgimento.11.t: "State Names: English, Regional Dialects, or Italian?"
risorgimento.11.d: "This mod gives you the option to play with Italian names for victory-points within Italian territories. Do you want to enable this? For immersion purposes, enabling the regional dialects is highly encouraged! If enabled, all VP’s will appear under their regional dialect denominations, with further decisions upon unification to standardize the Italian language across the peninsula, in part, changing the names of cities. You should be warned that these “dialects” for most of history have been considered languages of their own, and in some instances can vastly differ from their modern designations."
risorgimento.11.a: "I want the Italian Names."
risorgimento.11.b: "Yes I want the Regional Dialect names!"

Between 1815 and 1848, fewer and fewer Italians have been content to live under foreign rulers.

PIE_Victor_Emmanuel_Army_HC: "Victor Emmanuel II"
POLITICS_Camillo_Benso_di_Cavour_DESC: "Genevan by birth, his mother brought into the Cavour family the influence of Geneva, a city open to all the political, religious, and social movements of the period. The French Revolution imperiled the possessions of the Cavours because of their close ties with the Ancien Régime, but Camillo's father reestablished the family in an eminent position in Napoleonic society. As the younger son who could not hope for the economic and social position that would fall to his elder brother, Camillo saw a brilliant career open up before him under the protection of the court of Charles Albert, Prince of Savoy. \n\n His lack of enthusiasm for the court position and his open ridicule of the page-boy's uniform he was obliged to wear created controversy and confirmed the growing suspicions of rebellious intent within the young Camillo. He was influenced by the liberal ideas of the French writers Benjamin Constant and François Guizot, and his adversaries remained those of his childhood: paternalistic absolutism; legitimist reactionaries representing the landed interests, the aristocracy, and the clergy; and the union of throne and altar. His father got him appointed mayor of a village south of Turin. Social interests began to absorb him; the problems of poverty and prisoner education became the subjects of his research. In 1834, he wrote a memoir on poverty in Piedmont, which was published the following year in London in the 'Report from His Majesty's Commissioners for Inquiring into the Administration and Practical Operation of the Poor Laws.' A second pamphlet on the history of the Poor Laws in England was edited and published by Cavour in 1835 in Turin.\n\n His transition to politics was completed when King Charles Albert decided to embark on measures of reform and to concede a certain amount of freedom to the press. This prompted Cavour to offer his services as a volunteer until, on being elected a deputy in the Third Legislature, he began to fight for the approval of a peace treaty with Austria, although the extremists of the left wanted to continue a war that was, in effect, already lost. In October 1850, he was offered the post of Minister of Agriculture and soon became the most active and influential member of the Cabinet. The European drama into which Cavour was drawn against his will began in 1854 with the Crimean War, with the combined efforts of France, Great Britain, and Piedmont to secure the prosperity of the Ottoman Empire against the encroaching Russian Empire.\n\n Cavour advocates a complete anti-Austrian movement across the Piedmontese lands to fulfill the Risorgimento and unite the Italian lands, a promise he is willing to keep."

ita.900.d: "Camillo Benso and the Sardinia-Piedmont government have successful unified the Italian Peninsula. Following multiple conflicts and a victory against the Austrian Empire the Italian People are finally letting out a sigh of relief. Nationalist sentiment has been growing ever since the revolutions of 1848 encouraged Sardinia-Piedmont to lead the charge towards a unified Italy. Many wonder what path the new nation will follow as it faces many issues, and how this new European power could shift the balance of power."
ita.900.a: "Remarkable"
ita.901.t: "Unification of Italy"
ita.901.d: "Following a decision by Sardinia-Piedmont to follow a Garibaldian path to unification, they have successfully united a majority of the peninsula. The radical approach to unification which relied heavily on the support of Italian Nationalists was doubted by many, but no longer can anyone question the resolve of the Italian people.Nationalist sentiment has been growing ever since the revolutions of 1848 encouraged Sardinia-Piedmont to lead the charge towards a unified Italy.

ita.902.d: "The unification of Italy has been completed, and by an unexpected nation. Tuscany, united by its people's allegiance to liberty, did not align themselves with Sardinia-Piedmont. Instead they carved their own path towards unification. Nationalist sentiment has been growing ever since the revolutions of 1848 encouraged Sardinia-Piedmont to lead the charge towards a unified Italy.

ita.904.d: "Following the unification of the Kingdom of Italy, many wondered what the future would be of the Papal lands not yet under control of the new nation. It was no secret that many within Italy considered Rome to be the rightful capital of the nation. This dilemma has been referred to as the "Roman Question" and apparently Europe has her answer. Through an impressive feat of diplomacy, an agreement has been reached in which the French garrison will leave the Papal lands and Latium as well as Rome will be transferred to the Kingdom of Italy. The Catholic Church and the Pope will maintain personal sovereignty over Rome and will continue to function independent within an area of Rome known as the Vatican. This diplomatic answer comes as a surprise to many who assumed that conflict was the only possible solution to this problem."

ita.1.d: "For about a month elections have been ongoing for the first unitary Italian parliament. The expectation has been that due to the popularity and limited voting rights within Italy, Camillo Benso and his government will easily gain the majority of the House. Despite this assumption, there are many political leaders on the left who have favor among the people of Italy. Many wait to hear the results as the King prepares to inaugurate the new Parliament."

The law gave the state the right and duty to intervene in school matters, challenging the long standing tradition of Catholic Church schooling within Italy.

He has mentioned retaining the title of Victor Emmanuel the 2nd in honor of his House of Savoy, but many have claimed that he should take the title Victor Emmanuel the 1st in honor of the newly formed Kingdom of Italy.

ita.7.d: "After Garibaldi's Southern Dictatorship was annexed into Sardinia-Piedmont the Southern Army which had been formed was left in the South with no assignments. Out of fear for how the Republicans within the army may behave if the army was brought North, Cavour has ordered the dissolution of the army with severance for the soldiers. Commander of the Southern Army Giuseppe Sirtoi evoked strong protests but to no avail."

ita.9.t: "Garibaldi Makes Speach Regarding Dissolution of the Southern Army"
ita.9.d: "Following Cavour's announcement on the dissolution of the Southern Army, Garibaldi made an appearence in parliament to protest the action. Garibaldi spoke boldy stating that "the cold and enemy hand of this Ministry wishes to provoke a fratricidal war."Count Cavour's reaction was quite violent as he demanded that president Rattazii call the general to order.

ita.10.d: "Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, father of the Italian nation, has died in Turin as his family palace. Having been battling an illness for quite some time, Count Cavour had been retired to his bedside for quite some time. His death is being attributed to various complications with malaria that the Count had experienced since his childhood in the family rice fields in Vercelli.\n\n Despite having been excommunicated in 1855 and never retracting his anticlerical choices, Father Giacomo from Santa Maria adminstered confession and administered the anoiting of the sick. Cavour apparently told his trusted friend Luigi Carlo Farini that he desired for the people of Turin to know that he was dying as a good Christian." Cavour shared some final words with King Victor Emmanuel before he finally passed..."

I have many things to communicate to Your Majesty, many papers to show you: but I am too sick; it will be impossible for me to go to visit your Majesty; but I'll send Farini to you tomorrow, and he'll talk to you about everything in particular. Did your Majesty receive the letter you were expecting from Paris? The Emperor is very good to us now, yes, very good. And our poor Neapolitans so smart! There are some who have a lot of ingenuity, but there are also some who are very corrupt. These must be washed. Sire, yes, yes, wash, wash! No state of siege, no means of absolute government. Everyone is good at governing with the state of siege [... ] Garibaldi is a gentleman, I do not want any harm. He wants to go to Rome and Venice, and so do I: no one is in a hurry more than us. As for Istria and Tyrol it is another thing. It will be the work of another generation. We have done enough of us: we have made Italy, yes Italy, and it goes ...""
ita.11.a: "The country will mourn such a loss"
ita.12.t: "The Closing of Regional Custom Barriers"
ita.12.d: "The movement of goods throughout the Italian peninsula has always been hindered by custom barriers at each of the previous Italian States. Now that Italy is one state, the Right has begun the process to close these barriers. Many on the left decry that this move is premature, as Italy currently lacks a unified currency and a proper structure of trade has not been setup between the regions of Italy. Whether premature or not, the move is already done."
ita.12.a: "It is time to get the goods flowing!"
ita.13.t: "Reorganization of the Army"
ita.13.d: "Over the last few years the Sardinian Army has been going through great organizational changes as the armies of the old nations of the Italian Peninsula join our ranks. Now, with the formal proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, War Minister Manfredo Fanti is preparing his decree for the formal creation of the Regio Esercito to merge the forces under our command."
ita.13.a: "May our Armies Grow Stronger!"
ita.14.t: "King Victor Emmanuel Appoints Ricasoli Prime Minister"
ita.14.d: "King Victor Emmaneul has entrusted Bettino Ricasoli with forming a new government following the passing of Camillo Benso. The politician from Tuscany quickly became well established with the Count of Cavour and worked with him throughout unification within Tuscany. Following the annexation of Tuscany into Sardinia-Piedmont, Ricasoli was given a prominent position within the interior ministry. The King continues Cavour's trust for Ricasoli into this new government as many issues plague the Italian state."
ita.14.a: "May Ricasoli Finish What Cavour Started"
ita.15.t: "Signing of the Pepoli Law"
ita.15.d: "The Pepoli Law has officially been signed into action today, marking a great shift in the future of the Italian Economy and Banking. The law extends the lira of the Kingdom of Sardinia, now the Italian Lira, across the entire peninsula. It also states that all circulation of pre-unification currencies must stop by the end of the year. This is just one part of the movement towards Piedmontization which strenghtens the Piedmontese politicians and holdings while threatening the economies of the South."
ita.15.a: "One Italy Requires One Currency"
ita.16.t: "Ricasoli Offers His Resignation"
ita.16.d: "Dissensions within the government have reached a boiling point for Prime Minister Ricasoli. The Iron Baron has been tormented by dissent formented by Minister Cordova and many of his cabinet have offered their resignation. The King, indisposed by poor health, recieved a letter from the Prime Minister in which Ricasoli expects "that Vittorio Emanuele and the King deign to hive him freedom, peace, and rest." Victor Emmanuel is expected to accept the resignation of Ricasoli momentarily."
ita.16.a: "The Iron Baron Gave us his Best"
ita.17.t: "Formation of the Rattazzi Government"
ita.17.d: "Following the resignation of Baron Ricasoli, Urbano Rattazzi has been called upon to form a new government in Italy. His cabinet is formed almost entirely of Piedmontese politicians, and contains many independents close to the left. Prior to Cavour's death, Rattazzi had a massive break with the Count but became close to King Victor Emmanuel. The main issue for Rattazzi, it seems, is the Italian lands still under foreign control."
ita.17.a: "May the Rattazzi Government be a Strong One"
ita.18.t: "Foreign Policy in the Kingdom of Italy"
ita.18.d: "The newborn Kingdom of Italy has many concerns in foreign policy. First and foremost, is the need for diplomatic recognition of the Kingdom of Italy. We will need more nations to recognize our new state in order to take our place among the powers of Europe. The Roman Question has also caused a great stir in the parliament. Diplomacy seems to be the most popular avenue for securing the Italian lands not yet under our control, especially Rome."
ita.18.a: "There is Much to be Done"
ita.19.t: "Recognition from France"
ita.19.d: "Ever since our intervention in the Crimean War, France has served as a close ally to our cause. The influence of Count Nigra in both of our courts and the shared intrigued between our nations has made us very close. It is only naturally, then, that we should ask the French to formally recognize the Kingdom of Italy."
ita.19.a: "May our Friendship Continue"
ita.20.t: "Italy Seeks our Recognition"
ita.20.d: "The newly formed Kingdom of Italy has requested that we formally recognize their new nation. Sardinia-Piedmont long served as a diplomatic ally of ours since they joined the coalition against Russia in the Crimean War. It is only natural that we be the first major nation to recognize their nation, as it would be senseless to pretend that a divided Italy is possible in our future."
ita.20.a: "May our Friendship with Italy Continue!"
ita.21.t: "French Recognition"
ita.21.d: "Our Friends to our West have become the first nation to formally recognize us as the Kingdom of Italy. Soon to follow will be the rest of Europe, and the greater world!"
ita.21.a: "A Great Start to Italian Foreign Policy"
ita.22.t: "The Roman Question"
ita.22.d: "In his first speech to the Chamber of Deputies, Cavour has called for the Roman Question to be solved. In his speech the Count recognized the lack of Rome and Lazio from the lands of the Kingdom of Italy. In his conclusion he stated that Rome "is the necessary capital of Italy, because without Rome being united with Italy as its capital, Italy could not have a definitive order." The Catholic Church within the Kingdom of Italy has already faced tough laws from the political camp of Cavour, though it seems diplomacy will be the Count's favored method to gaining hold of Rome."
ita.22.a: "This Question Must be Resolved"
ita.23.t: "Free Church in a Free State"
ita.23.d: "In a Speech on the Roman Question Cavour has used the phrase "Free Church in a Free State" in relation to what he thinks the position of the Catholic Church should be within Italy. This statement directly challenges the Temporal power of the Pope, who has been an integral figure in Italian politics for centuries. Following his speech a warning was sent to Pope Pius that read "Holy Father, temporal power for you is no longer a guarantee of independence.""
ita.23.a: "The Church is Weakening"
ita.24.t: "Warning from the Kingdom of Italy"
ita.24.d: "A warning was recieved today from Camillo Benso that directly threatened our nation's independence. Following a speech in which Count Cavour called for a "Free Church in a Free State," a warning was sent to our diplomats that read "Holy Father, temporal power for you is no longer a guarentee of independence." This is an outrageous offence from the new Kingdom of Italy and a direct attack against our Church."
ita.24.a: "We Cannot Allow This to Stand"
ita.25.t: "A Reconciliation Project with Rome"
ita.25.d: "Ricasoli has inherited quite the mess in regards to foreign policy. Cavour was in the midsts of negotiating a deal with France and the Papal States that could have led to the annexation of Rome if not for his sudden death. It is the hopes of the government that these plans could be salvaged."
ita.25.a: "We must try"
ita.26.t: "Italy Proposes Meeting on the Papal States"
ita.26.d: "The new Prime Minister of Italy - Bettino Ricasoli - is hoping to have a meeting in Paris in order to discuss the future of the Papal States. Ricasoli takes over this position from Cavour, whose untimely death interrupted prior talks on the future of Rome. Our position as the protectors of Rome and the Papal States means we must weigh this proposal very seriously."
ita.26.a: "We Should Allow this Meeting"
ita.26.b: "We Cannot Allow this Meeting"
ita.27.t: "Italy Proposes Meeting in Paris on the Future of Rome"
ita.27.d: "It is no secret that the Kingdom of Italy has aspirations to bring Lazio and Rome into their lands. New Prime Minister of Italy Bettino Ricasoli has proposed that our nations, and our French protectors, meet in Paris to talk on the future of Rome. While the Pontificate has been rash when dealing with the Italians in diplomacy, our French protectors have already agreed to this meeting and resisting could upset them."
ita.27.a: "This Meeting Could be Beneficial"
ita.27.b: "The Very Idea is an Insult!"
 ita.28.t: "War Again?"
 ita.28.d: "With Prussia at war with Austria the opportunity for further expansion to liberate Italian lands is upon us. The people of Italy are not yet fully united and our independence fight is not yet won. It comes time to show our strength as a nation in Europe and we will dominate!"
 ita.28.a: "To War!"
ita.29.t: "France Declines a Meeting on Rome"
ita.29.d: "The French have declined to host a meeting on the future of the Papal State in Paris. For reasons likely relating to their current status of the protector of the Papal State, the French have not shown any interest to continue the talks first started by Cavour. This is a great setback for the hope to solve the Roman Question with diplomacy."
ita.29.a: "This is Very Unfortunate"
 ita.30.t: "Peace"
 ita.30.d: "Following hard fought battles in lands wrongfully occupied by the Austrian Empire we have finally secured enough land and victories to consider bringing demands to the peace table. Our government is not enough radical to push for support to seek out a longer war at the risk of Prussia exiting the war before us, and leaving us to face the Austrian menace alone."
ita.31.t: "The Papal States Refuse to Meet in Paris"
ita.31.d: "Our delegates have informed us that the Papal States' diplomats are reluctant to attend a meeting on the existance of their state in Paris, finding the very idea insulting. While some believe we should respect the wishes of the Pope, others have relayed that not hearing the Italian proposal could simply be delaying the inevitable. We could still hear the Italian proposal without the Papal delegates in attendance."
ita.31.a: "There is no Point in Delaying the Issue"
ita.31.b: "Without the Support of the Pope, We Cannot Pursue This"
ita.32.t: "The Papal States Refuse to Meet in Paris"
ita.32.d: "The French delegates have informed us that the Papal States will not be sending a delegation to Paris to discuss the Roman Question. Despite this setback, the French are still willing to hear our proposal. If we play our cards right we may be able to still find a deal that will bring Rome into the Italian fold, despite the Papal stubbornness."
ita.32.a: "Unfortunate, but Acceptable"
ita.33.t: "Our Proposal on the Roman Question"
ita.33.d: "Our proposal that should be made in Paris on Rome must be well thought out before finalized. The removal of the French garrison from the Papal States and the subsequent annexation of Rome into the Kingdom of Italy is the necessary result of our proposal. Continuing from the work of Cavour, the ministers have recommended that we offer, in return for the annexation of the lands into Italy, that the personal sovereignty of Pius IX remains over the capital, an annual donation be made to the Vatican, and Papal Autonomy remains for matters such as the appointment of Bishops. While a sound proposal to many, King Vittorio Emanuele II has recently started advocating for putting the Roman Question aside in favor of focusing on Veneto - meaning we must complete these talks sooner rather than later."
ita.33.a: "We Must Present the Proposal as it is"
ita.34.t: "The Italian Proposal on Rome"
ita.34.d: "The Italians have presented their proposal so solve the so-called Roman Question. Their proposal, in return for the annexation of the lands of the Papal States into Italy, is that the the personal sovereignty of Pius IX remains over the capital, an annual donation be made to the Vatican, and Papal Autonomy remains for matters such as the appointment of Bishops. Our ministers are somewhat split on the proposal. While it would maintain the power of the Pope over parts of Rome and allow the Church to still have global outreach, many fear that this could weaken Catholic resolve around the world."
ita.34.a: "We Can Accept This Proposal"
ita.34.b: "We Can Accept This Proposal"
ita.34.c: "We Cannot Accept This Proposal"
ita.35.t: "The French Accept the Italian Proposal"
ita.35.d: "During the meeting in Paris on the future of the Papal States with the new Kingdom of Italy, the French have seemingly accepted the Italian proposal. The Italian proposal, in return for the annexation of Papal lands into Italy, is that the personal sovereignty of Pius IX remains over the capital, an annual donation be made to the Vatican, and Papal Autonomy remains for matters such as the appointment of Bishops. While certainly not a proposal any in the Church are wanting to accept, there are some gaurentees within here that solidfy the Church would remain somewhat influential in Europe. With the French having already accepted this proposal, it is unlikely we can avoid losing our lands."
ita.35.a: "We Have to Accept"
ita.35.b: "We Simply Cannot Accept This"
ita.36.t: "The Italian Proposal"
ita.36.d: "Despite our French protectors not wishing to be involved, our meeting with the Italian delegates has begun. Their proposal, to solve the infamous Roman Question, is that, in return for the annexation of our lands into Italy, the personal sovereignty of Pius IX remains over the capital, an annual donation be made to the Vatican, and Papal Autonomy remains for matters such as the appointment of Bishops. While certainly not a proposal any in the Church are wanting to accept, there are some gaurentees within here that solidfy the Church would remain somewhat influential in Europe."
ita.36.a: "In Order to Secure our Future, We Accept"
ita.36.b: "We Cannot Accept This"
ita.37.t: "The French Decline the Italian Proposal"
ita.37.d: "During the meeting in Paris between delegates from France and Italy, the French have seemed to decline the possibility of the Italian Proposal. The Italian Proposal was that in exchange for the annexation of our lands into the Kingdom of Italy the personal sovereignty of Pius IX remains over the capital, an annual donation be made to the Vatican, and Papal Autonomy remains for matters such as the appointment of Bishops. While certainly not a proposal any in the Church are wanting to accept, there are some gaurentees within here that solidfy the Church would remain somewhat influential in Europe. Given the French have declined this proposal we can safely also decline it. However, some within the Church believe that declining will only leave this problem to be solved within the next few years, possibly through war."
ita.37.a: "The French Have Defended us Again"
ita.37.b: "Despite the French, We Must Accept This"
ita.38.t: "The Papal States Accept the Proposal"
ita.38.d: "After hearing that we had accepted the Italian proposal on the future of the Roman Question, the Papal States have notified us that they are willing to accept the Italian proposal. While certainly not a day of celebration, many of our ministers are hopeful that this will help build a strong alliance between Italy, France, and the Catholic Church. We must now prepare to remove our garrisons from the Papal States as the transfer of lands begins."
ita.38.a: "May This be the Start of Something Grand"
ita.39.t: "The Proposal Has Been Accepted"
ita.39.d: "Despite the surprise by many of the ministers, and King Victor Emmanuel himself, Ricasoli's proposal on the Roman Question has been accepted by the Papal States and France. The French have already made the preparations to remove their garrisons from the Papal States and soon enough the official transfer of the land will begin. The people of Italy can celebrate now that our nation will have Rome as its rightful capital soon enough."
ita.39.a: "This is Wonderful!"
ita.40.t: "Papal States Refuse Proposal from Italy"
ita.40.d: "Despite our delegates having already accepted it, the Papal States have refused to codify the Italian proposal. Our garrisons have already been ordered to prepare to exit the Papal States and the Italians will expect that we stick to the deal. The Papal States may put up some resistance, but it is unlikely they will hold out against the Italians. We can only hope the Italians hold up their part of the deal if the Papal States do resort to conflict."
ita.40.a: "That is Unfortunate"
ita.41.t: "The French Accept the Proposal, Papal States Decline"
ita.41.d: "The French have been willing to accept the proposal put forward by our delegates at the meeting in Paris. Despite this, the Papal delegation has refused to codify the agreement. The French have started preparations to have their garrisons leave the Papal States already and the deal will go through whether the Papal States are willing or not, as without their French protectors they will not be able to stop us."
ita.41.a: "Unfortunate That it Came to This"
ita.42.t: "The Papal States Accept Our Proposal"
ita.42.d: "Despite the position of the French, the Papal States have accepted our proposal on the future of Rome and the lands surrounding it. Likely hopeing to avoid future conflict and recognizing that they have more to gain through a close relationship with our nation, the Papal delegation has codified the proposal. The French will now have to prepare to have their garrisons leave the Papal States as the official transfer of lands is underway."
ita.42.a: "A Great Victory for Italy"
ita.43.t: "The Papal States have Accepted the Italian Proposal"
ita.43.d: "Despite our position on the Italian Proposal on the future of the Roman Question, Italian and Papal delegates have been able to reach a conclusion on their own. Likely hopeing to avoid future conflict and recognizing that they have more to gain through a close relationship with the new Italian nation, the Papal delegation has codified the proposal. We will have to begin the process of moving our garrisons out of the Papal States to allow the transfer of land to conclude and ensure the deal is able to go on."
ita.43.a: "This is a Surprising Result"
ita.44.t: "The Papal States Decline our Proposal"
ita.44.d: "Despite our best efforts it seems Ricasoli will have to give up on solving the Roman Question for now. The attempts to find a diplomatic solution to the question of Rome have yielded no results and King Victor Emmaneul has become very displeased with what he now considers a waste of time. He has now demanded we turn our attention to Venice instead."
ita.44.a: "We Have Failed"
ita.80.t: "The French Decline the Italian Proposal"
ita.80.d: "During the meeting in Paris between delegates from France, Italy, and ourselves, the French have seemed to decline the possibility of the Italian Proposal.

ita.45.t: "Transfer of the Capital to Rome"
ita.45.d: "With Rome now under our control, the time has come to finally transfer our capital to Rome. It was Cavour who boldy claimed in one of his first speeches as Prime Minister of Italy that Rome is the natural capital of Italy, and now that has become reality. Crowds are expected to gather in Rome as King Victor Emmanuel prepares to make a speech on the momentous occasion."

In Trentino the protests have gathered into very organized groups of people, many armed. The Ministers fear that they may mean to lead an insurrection into Veneto.

Our reports indicate that he will land in Calabria within the coming days in order to move futher up the peninsula. If he is allowed to move towards Rome, we risk conflict with the French who are stationed in the Papal States."

An initial firefight between the volunteers and some regulars, as well as some shelling from the navy, has pushed Garibaldi back into the hills of Aspromonte. Colonel Emilio Pallavicini is prepared with a column of 3,000 regulars to advance on the position."

ita.49.t: "The Clash at Aspromonte"
ita.49.d: "Colonel Emilio Pallavicini ordered his troops into chain columns, regulars in the back and Bersaglieri in the front under command to be "on fire while advancing." Garibaldi, distressed by the fact that his troops had dwindled from 2,000 to just over 1,000, ordered his own men to cease fire as to not fire upon their brothers. However, the center led by Menotti, mostly of young volunteers, charged the Bersaglieri and initially pushed them back. Garibaldi, caught between the two firing lines, received two rifle bullets, in the left hip and in the right malleolus. When the general fell the volunteers retreated to the forest while officers tended to Garibaldi. Colonel Pallavicini and his officers approached Garibaldi and asked for his surrender. Seeing former officers that he had fought along side with him just years before, Garibaldi was inclined to surrender and was arrested."

ita.50.d: "With the American Civil War going on and our nation being newly united our government faces a tough decision. The Confederate States would seek to use our ports as a place for their ships to dock and repair away from the eyes of the Union. The Union will seek to have our guarantee that the Confederates will not have this right and we would not recognize them as a legitimate state. Whatever decision our government makes it will have a lasting impact on our relations with whatever state comes out of the Civil War."

This could be a sign of a lasting relationship with the new state, as we have already traded with many of the nations prior to unification."
ita.51.a: "Great News!"
ita.52.t: "Italy Offers Docking Rights"
ita.52.d: "The question of where our navy might be safe to travel has been hard to find an answer for, until now. In a surprising turn of events the new Italian State has foreignd the rights for our ships to enter their long coastline and dock when needed whether under chase of the Union navy, or heavy weather. This could be a major breakthrough in getting major European nations to recognize our state as a legitimate one."

ita.53.d: "In a surprising turn of events the new Italian State to grant them docking rights. This was a concern that many in our government did not expect to see come true.

This has caused a rumor to spread that a Rattazzi-Farini-Minghetti-Peruzzi government may be prepared. However, the reality is that Rattazzi is desperately trying to strengthen his government. Some ministers, especially from the left, have been suggesting an agenda of no confidence may be in the cards soon."

ita.55.t: "Meeting of Dissendent Ministers"
ita.55.d: "Reports are coming that a meeting has taken place between ministers currently in groups dissenting from the support of Rattazzi's government. While exact numbers are not certain, there is certainly reason to be worried. Rattazzi must take control of the situation and gain strength for his government or risk being forced into resignation, preferably before Victor Emmanuel loses favor with him."

Our citizens have been watching the events in Italy unfold over the last decade very intently, and the news has been reporting every development. Now that Italy is a single state, we will be expected to recognize the legitimacy of the new nation.

ita.57.d: "The citizens of the United States have been supporting the unification movement for quite some time now. Many Italians have emigrated from Italy to the United States, which has inspired the media there to keep tabs on our situation. Now, the United States Government has even become one of the first nations to formally recognize us as the Kingdom of Italy."

ita.61.d: "After losing the trust of many deputies and ministers inside the government, Rattazzi fears he has now lost the support of the King himself. He had met with King Victor Emmanuel to inform him of his will to resign, who gave a mandate of trust to Cassinis, who conferred with Count Senator Pasolini on the formation of a new ministry. The short-lived leadership of Rattazzi comes just after the short-lived leadership of Ricasoli, setting a poor precedent for future leaders."
ita.61.a: "Who Will Replace Him?"
ita.62.t: "Luigi Carlo Farini to Replace Rattazzi"
ita.62.d: "It is claimed that Luigi Carlo Farini, a physician turned politician, will succeed Rattazzi when the incumbent minister announces his formal retirement in the chambers today. He has earned the Count Pasolini and the King's trust to that point. Farini had previously held positions in the municipal administrations of Modena and the Neapolitan provinces, where he oversaw some of the plebiscites for unification."

ita.63.t: "Farini's Mental Illness Evident"
ita.63.d: "Following the first few weeks of Farini's prime ministership, it has become increasingly evident that the man is severely mentally ill. The ministers and the king have decided to keep this a secret for now, as important negotiations for loans are occurring with a financial group.

ita.68.d: "Southern Italy, specifically those provinces previously under Bourbon control, is currently in a state of near open-rebellion. Brigands and criminals run amok in the South. Unfortunately, these brigands are aided by bands of foreign volunteers. Both Bourbons from across Europe and clericals alike have started to amass, organizing in taverns in the Papal States - where the Bourbon government exists in exile - in the hopes to raid the South and start revolts. This situation of brigandry must be solved quickly before a proper rebellion is on our hands."

Farini would continue his studies and become well renowned for much of his work. After spending some time studying rabies and hospitals within the Papal States, Farini left for Turin during the events of 1848. After that point he became fully immersed in Italian politics. Farini is a staunch anti-cleric and vocal in his disgust with the people of Southern Italy."

In a recent meeting with King Victor Emmanuel, Farini threatened the King with a knife to his throat to declare war on Russia in support of the Polish cause for independence. The former Prime Minister is expected to soon be admitted to an asylum and the King is preparing to allow Marco Minghetti the power to form a new government."
ita.71.a: "What a Disaster"
ita.72.t: "Marco Minghetti Takes Over as Prime Minister"
ita.72.d: "Marco Minghetti, minister of finance under Farini, has been charged with the task of creating a new government. Minghetti is a newer face to Italian politics than most of the prime ministers before him, however, he does not lack the political skill for the job. He served in foreign policy duties under Cavour and wrote many important political writings during the 1850s. Now he has been thrusted into one of the highest positions in Italian politics, hopefully he will fare better than his predecessors."

The goal behind the project imagines greater municipal autonomy with the enargement of the municipal body and the electivity of the mayor. The project does not appear to have popular support in parliament but it is possible the Minghetti could convince some members who are on the fence if he is willing to make some concessions."

ita.75.t: "The Legacy of General Cialdini"
ita.75.d: "When General Cialdini was appointed to lead the supression of Southern Brigand groups, the government did not expect him to utilize the vicious strategies he ended up employing. General Cialdini's last few months has seen the number of troops being utilized in the South increase to almost 50,000. All the meanwhile, Cialdini utilizes summary shootings, village fires, mass arrests, arbitrary executions, and destruction of private property. While in charge he is also indirectly, or perhaps more directly than we are willing to admit, been responsbile for the events of Pontelandolfo and Casalduni as well as the massacre of Auletta.\n      General Alfonso La Marmora has been appointed as his replacement, as Cialdini has become subject of international scandal."

Liberals of the town fled to neighboring cities to warn the National Guard and the Royal Carabinieri who immediately approached the town. Italian soldiers were initially scared off by shots from the town upon which the Bersaglieri were called upon to flank the town.\n\n Following the military conquest of the town, much of the legitimists had fled. However, the Italian soldiers took out brutal repression on the civilian population. 45 Victims have been confirmed, 5 of which were priests or religious. The priests were beaten to death and forced to kneel infront of the Savoyard tricolor. One elderly religious who tried to get up was shot in the head by a Sergeant. Over 200 citizens now sit imprisoned and rumors spread that as many as 130 lay dead."

ita.77.d: "After local officials and security were forced to flee the region, Brigands known to find shelter South of the Matese mountains overran the town of Pontelandolfo. Bands were greated by townspeople and local clergy while they processed with a marching band in tow. The local barracks was short of demolished and portraits of the King and Garibaldi were torn to shreds. Veterans of the Neapolitan Army, now in service of the Kingdom of Italy, failed to bring the town to order and had their weapons seized. This brigand band is led by Cosimo Giordano, a former member of the Army of the Two Sicilies, and has become a terror in the South."

ita.78.t: "Massacre of Reconnaissance Soldiers"
ita.78.d: "Members of the National Guard and Carabinieri were sent to reconnaissance the towns of Casalduni and Pontelandolfo to gauge the strength of brigands occupying the towns. After camping in a small town the soldiers attempted to retreat following reports of approaching Bourbons. Finding the road closed, the soldiers were caught between two enemy forces. Many men died in the firefight and those who were taken prisoner were later killed in Casalduni. One Sergeant who survived has reached General Cialdini who has given the order to burn the towns to the ground."

Colonel Pier Eleonoro Negri headed General Cialdini's order that 'Pontelandolfo and Casalduni do not remain stone by stone.' Soldiers entered the towns and spared nobody. Buildings were burned and as men, or women and children, exited they were shot. At least one girl was raped and pro-Piedmontese townspeople were not spared of robbery, rape, and murder. It is unclear just how many of the 4500 inhabitants have died but certainly all have suffered."

ita.81.d: "The unfortunate date agreed upon by France in Italy in a conference on the status of Rome has been reached. The French garrison no longer protects our nation from the eager eyes of the Kingdom of Italy. The Italians have wasted no time, and a force is on its way to our lands in order to enact the terms of the treaty they have signed with France. We can meet this force diplomatically or try our best to defend our lands."

ita.82.t: "The Papal States Peacefully Agree to Terms"
ita.82.d: "Now that the French garrison has left the Papal States, a force was sent to Papal Lands to ensure the capture of Rome. The Pope, likely seeing the impossibility of defending Rome, has agreed to the terms set by our treaty with the French. The Catholic Church has been reduced to a small area around the Vatican and Rome may soon be our capital."

Commissioners include a mix of leftist deputies such as Aurelio Saffi, Garibaldine soldiers like Bixio, and right wing deputies such as Massari who is expected to draft a final proposal. The commissioners will travel across the peninsula to investigate local and national government as well as the military repression."
ita.84.a: "Hopefully They Find Answers"
ita.85.t: "Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Banditry"
ita.85.d: "The Massari report, started under the Farini government to investigate brigandage, has published its findings. The report is somewhat startling to many members of the executive as well as parliament. It advocates for extreme measures to be taken against the bandit gangs of the south. It brings particular attention to the activity of foreign generals leading bands in the south. It also highlights distrust of Southern institutions ranging from clergy to local politicians. The government does not have a unified position on the report as of yet but might be inspired soon as brigand forces have increased their attacks."

ita.86.t: "Brigands Escape on French Ships"
ita.86.d: "Southern Brigands Cipriano and Giona La Gala have made an escape from Civitavecchia on a French ship. The brigands were close to apprehension by our forces and will now have the opportunity to escape abroad. The great clamor caused by this incident has inspired Parliament to act on the Massari report. Some deputies are even calling for action against the French government for allowing this to happen."
ita.86.a: "Finally Our Government Acts!"
ita.87.t: "Passage of the Pica Law"
ita.87.d: "Following the publishing of the Massari Report and the situation with French assistance to Brigands, the government has finally passed the Pica Law. Taking its name from Abruzzo deputy Giuseppe Pica, the Pica Law formally introduces banditry as a crime. The transgressors are to be tried by military courts with punishments ranging from shooting, forced labor, to imprisonment. There were only 33 votes against the measure. The law is the first to recognize the formation of criminal organizations."

D'Ondes has made a name for himself in the Italian Chamber of Deputies as a staunch defender of the Catholic faith which he professes. He has referred to the law as granting a colonial type status to the South of Italy. As a strong defender of the regional autonomy within Italy, he has proposed that additions of guarantor be added to the law. Despite these objections, many of his filings and bills fall on deaf ears."

ita.104.d: "Though it was planned that the many news operations owned by members of the government would print a story on the September Convention, the secret clause on the movement of the capital was to stay secret. The middle-class and aristocracy would not take kindly to learning of the movement of the capital to Florence. This move would appear to be the result of diplomatic pressure from France and lead to controversy. Unfortunately for the government, some of the papers have incorrectly printed stories surrounding the movement of the capital and the people of Turin are beginning to gather in the Scontri di Piazza San Carlo in Turin."

The soldiers previously arrested have also now been released. For some in Turin the news is disappointing as there will be no justice for those who lost their lives, but for the government there is some relief as Marmora tried to move past the events of the massacre."

The law extends the provisions of the Ricasoli Decree that made the law of Sardinia-Piedmont standard in much of Italy.

ita.111.d: "In order to stop rumors that the King may reverse the decision to transfer the capital to Florence, King Victor Emmanuel officially moved to Florence today. The move has caused a deep rift to those in Turin who had become accustomed to having the capital located there. However, politicians and citizens from Florence are eager to see how the government may devote resources to build up the city which has largely been ignored by the Italian government.

Under the government of Sardinia-Piedmont, much of the groundwork was laid for us to make further endeavours to increase our influence in the region. As it stands now, we operate a consulate in Hong Kong as well as Shanghai. For the most part, our diplomatic efforts are run by other nations present within the Qing with greater leverage than us, nations such as England and France have been instrumental in these efforts. Our merchants recieve poor treatment in their dealings in the Chinese silk trade, and our efficiency is not what it could be.

He is awaiting word from us before moving on the Beijing.\n\n Most intriguing of his reports is that of the involvement of Italians in the slave trade. Arminjon reports that he has uncovered that a multitude of Italian citizens are involved in China's slave trade and exportation to the America's. He also suggests that Italian consulates already present in China must have been aware of this fact despite never reporting it. This has been the cause of much uproar within our government."

These troops are trained as light infantry, specialized in scouting and flanking. They have become famous for their speed in executing commands. The Bersaglieri have seen action in the Crimean War as well as the various conflicts the past decade within the peninsula. Now that the Italian Army is being organized, a question has come up regarding their position within the army.

The Count of Cavour was an acclaimed figure throughout Europe and the wider world for pushing the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont towards a more offensive standpoint in European politics for the last decade. Benso's notorious efforts to include the kingdom into European politics came to fruition with the subsequent arrival of the Crimean War between the Russians and a unified force of Britain, France, and Piedmont-risorgimento. While their participation came to be seen as morally just, the true purpose was to allow the suggestion of a unified Italian peninsula at the peace discussions. More recently, Cavour has navigated European diplomacy to secure alliances for the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, allowing for the conquest of the rest of the Italian Peninsula; the defeat of the Austrian Empire; and the political unification and alliances made to further Italian unification. \n\n The whole of Europe now joins the Italian Peninsula in its deep anguish as it stops its celebrations to lament the passing of a great leader—the father of unified Italy."

ITA_PIE_focus_Reform_the_Siccardi_Laws_desc: "One of the main obstacles to better relations between the Pope and The Kingdom of Italy is the separation of church and state that was established through the Siccardi Laws of 1850 in Sardinia-Piedmont. The law was extended to the whole of Italy after the unification and complemented with other laws that that restricted religious corporations put church property under state control. Could a reform of the Siccardi laws, giving some of the power back to the church be the goodwill gesture that could significantly improve the relations with the Pope? Perhaps this could convince the Pope to accept the September Convention and from there the Italian unification and, hopefully, a satisfactory solution to the Roman question? "
ITA_PIE_focus_The_Subversive_Laws: "The Subversive Laws"
ITA_PIE_focus_The_Subversive_Laws_desc: "Despite all the goodwill efforts from Italy, the Pope steadfastly refuses to even talk about the Roman question. Furthermore, he is still actively against the Italian unification, by ordering Catholics to not vote in the general elections nor participate in the political decision making. Italy cannot allow a hostile entity to own property on its territory, that is why law 3848 will be implemented, confiscation church property and put it under the control of the state. Even the Pope must face the consequences of his actions!"
ITA_PIE_focus_Build_Recognition_in_Europe: "Build Recognition in Europe"
ITA_PIE_focus_Build_Recognition_in_Europe_desc: "Having won its independence and finally being united into one nation it is now time for Italy to become an equal among the other European nations. As such Italy needs to establish and maintain diplomatic relations with the major powers."
ITA_PIE_focus_Diplomacy_with_Prussia: "Diplomacy with Prussia"
ITA_PIE_focus_Diplomacy_with_Prussia_desc: "Prussia, the nation famous for its well-disciplined troops is on the rise again. The Prussian King has appointed a new chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, a shrewd politician that is working to reduce Austria’s influence in the German states. Perhaps the old saying that the enemy of my enemy is my friend can be applied here? A close diplomatic friendship with Prussia would force Austria to consider a potential threat from both the north and south."
ITA_PIE_focus_Further_Diplomacy_France: "Further Diplomacy with France"
ITA_PIE_focus_Further_Diplomacy_France_desc: "France provided not only moral and diplomatic support to the unification of Italy but also military support against Austria. Even if it, sadly, seems that France has ended on the opposite side of Italy in the Roman question, diplomatic relations with Italy’s closest friend must remain as warm as they are now, to act as a buffer against any Austrian revanchism. "
ITA_PIE_focus_The_Bucharest_Revolution: "The Bucharest Revolution"
ITA_PIE_focus_The_Bucharest_Revolution_desc: "There are developments in the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia that, not directly, affects Italy but are interesting, nonetheless. The current ruler has been deposed in a coup d’état and being replaced with a noble from Prussia. Although the new ruler is a good friend to the French emperor and the local population is Francophile it still shows the growing power of Prussia. There are opportunities here for Italy to, “put its eggs in different baskets”, by aligning itself with Prussia and decreasing its dependence on France in case of future conflicts with Austria."
ITA_PIE_focus_The_Brigandry_Cases: "The Brigandry Cases"
ITA_PIE_focus_The_Brigandry_Cases_desc: "The unification of Italy has brought with it a problem plaguing the former Kingdom of the 2 Sicilies, Brigandry and lawlessness. This problem has now been exasperated by ex-soldiers and loyalist of the old kingdom. Supported by the former king and the pope, these brigands have started a full rebellion against Italy. More troubling is that the brigands also seem to get support from the French! There are reports of Brigands not only being able to walk free in Rome but being encouraged in their endeavour by the French garrison there. There is an urgent need for clarification from France regarding were it stands on this matter."
ITA_PIE_focus_Strengthen_British_Relations: "Strengthen British Relations"
ITA_PIE_focus_Strengthen_British_Relations_desc: "The British Empire were one of the first nations that gave moral and diplomatic support to the unification of Italy despite international opposition. As such the British Empire is among Italy’s closest friends. It is vital that this friendship will be maintained and strengthened."
ITA_PIE_focus_Treaties_with_San_Marino: "Treaties with San Marino"
ITA_PIE_focus_Treaties_with_San_Marino_desc: "The ancient republic of San Marino served as a refuge for many people who were persecuted because of their support for Italian unification, the most famous of those is Giuseppe Garibaldi that hid there in 1849. Because of this Italy has accepted the wish of San Marino to not be incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy. Instead, Italy and San Marino have signed a treaty of friendship in which Italy guarantees the independence of the small republic. This was followed by an economic treaty in which Italy will mint the San Marino lira printing its stamps."
ITA_PIE_focus_Diplomacy_with_Austria: "Diplomacy with Austria"
ITA_PIE_focus_Diplomacy_with_Austria_desc: "Being the main opponent of Italian unification there is no exaggeration to claim that the relations between the new neighbours are frosty. Nevertheless, diplomatic relations will be needed. If for nothing else than to avoid misunderstandings or petty issues to escalate into new wars. "
ITA_PIE_focus_Reaction_to_Gastein_Conference: "Reaction to the Gastein Conference"
ITA_PIE_focus_Reaction_to_Gastein_Conference_desc: "The German question will not be solved peacefully, that much is clear now after the meetings between Prussian Minister President von Bismarck and the Austrian envoy von Blome. Austria must have realised that von Blome underestimated Bismarck’s negotiation skills with Prussia benefitting the most from the resulting treaty, sharpening the rivalry between Austria and Prussia."
ITA_PIE_focus_Open_Negotiations_for_the_Sale: "Open Negotiations for the Sale"
ITA_PIE_focus_Open_Negotiations_for_the_Sale_desc: "With everything pointing towards an armed confrontation between the two German powers, Austria has approach Italy with a sales offer. Italy can buy Veneto for a sum and in exchange of staying out of any war between Austria and Prussia. While seeing as a dishonourable solution by some it is still a worthy task if Veneto can become Italian without bloodshed."
ITA_PIE_focus_News_from_Count_Malaguzzi: "News from Count Malaguzzi"
ITA_PIE_focus_News_from_Count_Malaguzzi_desc: "Count Malaguzzi has brought word from Vienna that the Austrians are more willing than ever to advance with the sale of Veneto, even going so far as to suggest an alliance between Italy and Austria. The Austrian are likely hoping to build an alliance from Paris-Rome-Vienna."
ITA_PIE_focus_News_from_Nigra: "News from Nigra"
ITA_PIE_focus_News_from_Nigra_desc: "The Italian ambassador in Paris, Constantino Nigra, has confirmed that France will remain neutral in any conflict between Prussia and Austria and will have no objections if Italy would join such a war on Prussia’s side. Opening the possibility of an alliance with Prussia."
ITA_PIE_focus_Send_an_Agent_to_Berlin: "Send an Agent to Berlin"
ITA_PIE_focus_Send_an_Agent_to_Berlin_desc: "One of the leading powerbrokers in Europe right now is, without doubt, the current Minister President of Prussia, Otto Von Bismarck. It would be in Italy´s interest to have this man as an ally. Especially considering Italy’s interest in acquiring Italian territory that is still languishing under Austrian rule. It would be interesting to see what the results of some discreet inquiries could be. "
ITA_PIE_focus_Approach_our_Old_Enemies: "Approach Our Old Enemies"
ITA_PIE_focus_Approach_our_Old_Enemies_desc: "Maybe Austria would be interested in ceding Veneto for the price of Italian neutrality in a conflict between Austria-Prussia? A promise of Italian volunteers to fight on the Austrian side could help sweeten the deal. The alternative for Austria is the risk of a two-front war with Prussia in the north and Italy in the South."
ITA_PIE_focus_The_Third_War_of_Independence: "The Third War of Independence"
ITA_PIE_focus_The_Third_War_of_Independence_desc: "War has broken out again. The price for the Italian sacrifices is Veneto and then Rome. Italy shall be fully united. Viva Italia!"
ITA_PIE_focus_Armistice_of_Cormons: "Armistice of Cormons"
ITA_PIE_focus_Armistice_of_Cormons_desc: "The Third Italian War of Independence has come to a conclusion as the greater Austro-Prussian war has concluded with the signing of the Armstice of Cormons."
ITA_PIE_focus_Elections_of_1861: "Elections of 1861"
ITA_PIE_focus_Elections_of_1861_desc: "The first round of elections were held recently followed by a second round of voting. The elections were held according to the 1848 electoral law of the Kingdom of Sardinia, meaning that only men aged 25 or older and paying a certain level of taxation were allowed to vote. The Voters had to choose between the Conservative Right, the Liberal Left and the Radical Far Left."
ITA_PIE_focus_The_Left_Coalition: "The Left Coalition"
ITA_PIE_focus_The_Left_Coalition_desc: "The spirit of 1848 shows it is still strong among the population with this result. In what must be seen as a political upset, the independence heroes on the centre right have been pushed aside by a leftist wave. It is now up to statesmen like Urbano Ratazzi to prove that the dreams of 1848 can survive the contact with reality."
ITA_PIE_focus_Camillo_Benso: "Camillo Benso"
ITA_PIE_focus_Camillo_Benso_desc: "One of the leading figures in the movement for Italian unification and the leader of the Right party, The Count of Cavour, has become the young nations first prime minister. A brilliant statesman and former Prime Minister of Piedmont-Sardinia has his work cut out for him. One of the main issues is the location of the new nation’s capital. Many Italians want that to be Rome, but that would put Italy on a collision course with the Papal States. The new Prime Minister will have to tread carefully."
ITA_PIE_focus_Organization_New_State: "Organization of the New State"
ITA_PIE_focus_Organization_New_State_desc: "Creating a unified Italy out of several Kingdoms creates its own problems. A National Army needs to be created out of the former kingdom’s different armies. Which of the different legal institutions should be retained and were should they be situated? And above all, what about Rome?"
ITA_PIE_focus_Apply_Casati_Law: "Apply the Casati Law"
ITA_PIE_focus_Apply_Casati_Law_desc: "First introduced in the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia in 1859 this education law makes the state primarily responsible for running the public education system instead of the church. At the same time the law allows individuals to open and manage private schools."
ITA_PIE_focus_Bring_Leftist_Policies_Parliament: "Bring Leftist Policies to Parliament"
ITA_PIE_focus_Bring_Leftist_Policies_Parliament_desc: "It wasn’t just the great statesmen of Italy that were behind the unification and independence wars. Without the common people taking up arms and fight on the frontline those statesmen wouldn’t have succeeded. It is time that the common man receives the fruits of their sacrifices and hard work. Fair labour laws, fair elections, equality are the new words of the days."
ITA_PIE_focus_Piedmontization: "Piedmontization"
ITA_PIE_focus_Piedmontization_desc: "The first Italian elections were held according to the election laws of Piedmont-Sardinia. The King of Piedmont-Sardinia became the first King of Italy and now the first Italian prime minister is the former prime minister of Piedmont Sardinia. Others might grumble but being the leading nation behind the unification of Italy it is only natural that the new nation will be heavily influenced by Piedmont."
ITA_PIE_focus_Fiscal_Consolidation: "Fiscal Consolidation"
ITA_PIE_focus_Fiscal_Consolidation_desc: "Italy didn’t only inherit the different kingdoms militaries, judicial institutions and political and administrative systems, it also inherited the former kingdoms debts. This is why Cavour has introduced a policy where higher taxes should help pay these debts off as soon as possible. Giving Italy a truly fresh start as a young nation."
ITA_PIE_focus_Close_Custom_Barriers: "Close Custom Barriers"
ITA_PIE_focus_Close_Custom_Barriers_desc: "Having custom barriers towards neighbouring countries is one thing. Having them inside your country makes absolutely no sense. Southern Italy’s economy has suffered enough, and it is time for the regional customs to go. "
ITA_PIE_focus_Death_of_Cavour: "Death of Cavour"
ITA_PIE_focus_Death_of_Cavour_desc: "After only three months as Prime Minister, with many sleepless nights, Cavour’s health deteriorated. After falling ill and with his regular doctor being away, he asked to being bled by the doctors available. He was bled several times in a futile attempt to cure him until they couldn’t get a drop of blood more out of him. So passed one of Italy’s greatest statesmen."
