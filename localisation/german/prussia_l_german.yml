prussia.1.d:0 "Wegen des schlechten gesundheitlichen Zustands von König Friedrich Wilhelm IV, wurde vorerst sein Bruder und Thronfolger, Prinz Wilhelm I zum Regenten im [PRS.GetName] erklärt. Es sieht so aus, als würde sich die Gesundheit des Königs  nicht mehr verbessern, daher könnte diese Lösung bald dauerhaft werden."

prussia.2.d:0 "Friedrich Wilhelm IV ist tot."
prussia.2.a:0 "May he rest in peace."
prussia.3.t:0 "Die Krönung von Wilhelm I"
prussia.3.d:0 "Nach der Trauer um Friedrich Wilhelm IV muss unser Land nun mit der Krönung des neuen Königs nach vorn blicken. Dies passierte heute, als Wilhelm I offiziell in Königsberg gekrönt wurde!"
prussia.3.a:0 "Lang lebe König Wilhelm!"
prussia.4.t:0 "The King Abdicates"
prussia.4.d:0 "In light of the apparent consent between his ministers and parliament, Wilhelm I, King of Prussia, deeply disappointed with the proposed compromise and the attitude of the crown prince, has announced his intention to abdicate in favor of his son Friedrich Wilhelm, who has signalled his willingness to agree to the proposed reform bill."

There were a few complications during the prince's birth, but the mother and the child are well and their family and the Prussian people are happy for the birth of a new prince. The newborn prince might one day become King of Prussia because of the mental state and childlessness of his granduncle King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, who is very likely to pass the throne to his younger brother Wilhelm. If that happens, the prince will be second in line of succession right after his father, Crown Prince Friedrich."
prussia.8.a:0 "Hail Prince Wilhelm!"

#ADVISOR EVENTS
prussia.16.t:0 "Alexander von Humboldt tot aufgefunden!"
prussia.16.d:0 "Alexander von Humboldt, ein berühmter preußischer Wissenschaftler und Weltreisender, wurde tot in seiner Wohnung aufgefunden, nachdem sich sein körperlicher Zustand nach einigen Schlaganfällen in den letzten Monaten verschlechtert hatte. Nach einer großen Prozession wurde er in Berlin beigesetzt. Sein Tod ist ein großer Verlust für unser Land."
prussia.16.a:0 "Möge er in Frieden ruhen."
prussia.17.t:0 "Death of Ernst Moritz Arndt"
prussia.17.d:0 "The beloved hero, Ernst Moritz Arndt, was well known across the German states as an active nationalist and unifier. In his earlier years, he was an fighting for the abolition of serfdom, a form of debt paid for by peasants with military service, and later against Napoleonic rule. His most famous piece of work would be his song, 'Des Deutschen Vaterland', promoting the idea of a greater German nation. He will be deeply missed among the common people, as he was an inspiration for them."
prussia.17.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.18.t:0 "Death of Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann"
prussia.18.d:0 "Known throughout the German States for his famous writings and later national ideals, Dahlmann also took part in the Napoleonic Wars against the French at the Battle of Aspern, which resulted in an Austrian Victory. In 1848, he was elected to the national assembly at Frankfurt with the objective of unifying the German States under a constitutional monarchy. Although his desired 1848 constitution for Germany failed, he would later be called the 'father of German nationality', and our people, especially those with nationalist ideals, will deeply miss him."
prussia.18.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.19.t:0 "Death of Friedrich Julius Stahl"
prussia.19.d:0 "Word has been received that Friedrich Julius Stahl has unexpectedly passed away during a medical procedure. A Christian convert, Stahl used his wide influence to undermine the Prussian Union of Churches and to increase the power of the Lutheran Church. He wanted the state to adopt religious principles, which did not bring the likes of Bismarck to his side. Despite his reputation, Stahl would not end up playing a major role in the crisis of 1848/49, he asserted his influence under King Friedrich Wilhelm IV in the aftermath, though. Although he will surely be missed by many, the pious in particular, the majority of the Prussian people will probably forget about him."
prussia.19.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.20.t:0 "Death of Ferdinand Lassalle"
prussia.20.d:0 "Reports are coming in that Ferdinand Lassalle has been confirmed dead. Being a devout socialist and pro-monarchist at the same time, Lassalle was an ideologically conflicting man. He maintained relations with both the arch-communist Karl Marx and the arch-monarchist Otto von Bismarck. Although some will claim that Lassalle was a communist, in the end, he was the same thing that Bismarck was: a nationalist at heart, willing to undertake any social ideology to achieve the goal of a united Germany. His untimely death will surely be a severe blow to moderate socialism in Germany, as the movement loses its most brilliant thinker."
prussia.20.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.21.t:0 "Death of Carl von Bodelschwingh"
prussia.21.d:0 "A former parliament and government member, Carl von Bodelschwingh, has recently passed away. Besides his opposition against the 'fratricidal' war with Austria, he was a deeply religious man and a hardline conservative, but still desired a unified Germany all the same. He was a leading force behind the rail connections in the west that would be crucial for fast mobilization in times of war. His legacy, although strengthened by the many things he's done, was tarnished by his resignation over the power struggle with Austria. May he rest in peace."
prussia.21.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.22.t:0 "Death of August von der Heydt"
prussia.22.d:0 "August von der Heydt has recently been reported to have peacefully passed away at his home in Berlin. An economic genius under several administrations, he would become the mastermind behind Prussia's financial and administrative advantage over Austria. Under his oversight, the mining industry was thriving after he had gotten rid of the mining guild's special privileges. Hundreds of banks would thank him later, as without his removal of some of the Prussian banking restrictions, many of these wouldn't exist today."
prussia.22.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.23.t:0 "Death of Ernst Ludwig von Gerlach"
prussia.23.d:0 "Ernst Ludwig von Gerlach, an author and creator of the conservative newspaper 'Kreuzzeitung', has died in a traffic accident in Berlin earlier today. Being a staunch conservative, he opposed any form of conservative alliance with liberal nationalism throughout the 1860s and 70s even in the face of unification success. Although a protestant, he was deputy in the Reichstag for the Catholic Centre Party, and as such, voted against laws that were clearly discriminating against Catholics. Despite his great credentials, he shall remain little more than a footnote in the history of Germany."
prussia.23.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.24.t:0 "Death of Moritz August von Bethmann-Hollweg"
prussia.24.d:0 "Moritz August von Bethmann-Hollweg was a famous jurist and Prussian politician, who sadly passed away earlier today. Known mostly for his incredible influence on judicial reforms, King Friedrich Wilhelm IV elevated him to hereditary nobility shortly after the death of Friedrich Wilhelm III. Serving in both of Prussia's houses of parliament, he was an influential politician who caught the eyes of many. Much opposed to the democratizing tendencies of his time around Europe, he would co-found multiple organizations striving to preserve conservatism, including the 'Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag'. He will surely leave the conservative part of the country mourning him."
prussia.24.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.25.t:0 "Death of Friedrich von Wrangel"
prussia.25.d:0 "Friedrich von Wrangel, a true military legend, has passed away. A cavalry commander in his earlier days, he was loyal and ready to die in the service for his country. A staunch monarchist, during the March Revolution of 1848/49 he used emergency powers to overthrow the liberal president and put the kingdom before all else. He could be a controversial character, too, defying the king's orders to withdraw despite pressure from other European powers amidst the First Schleswig War, always believing in German unification until the end. His military honors shall be a list worth reading, and his name shall be written down in Prussian military history for centuries to come."
prussia.25.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.26.t:0 "Death of Albert Borsig"
prussia.26.d:0 "Today, on April 10 1878, renowned Prussian entrepreneur Albert Borsig has surprisingly passed away aged only 49. The Borsig family has been a very influential force in Prussia's economy, building one of the largest steam locomotive corporations on earth. Albert inherited his family's business after his father's death in 1854 and subsequently expanded operations to a global scale, whilst at the same time caring for the poor. A project remains even after his death, the Borsig Palace at the corner of the Wilhelmstraße in the heart of Berlin, which he had planned as a representative family residence, but sadly will not have the chance to see completed. Many will remember him as a famed entrepreneur and businessman, and the populace of Prussia mourns his death."
prussia.26.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.27.t:0 "Death of Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg"
prussia.27.d:0 "Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg, a well-known diplomat and bureaucrat, passed away in his sleep this morning. The late Eulenburg led our highly successful trade exhibition to Japan and China, resulting in favorable treaties with both nations. For his success, he was appointed to the Prussian government, where he would strive to improve our administrative capacity in the face of liberal and Catholic resistance. Without his efforts, the paperwork necessary to run the state would be miles high, and we may not have gotten this far without him, he will truly be missed."
prussia.27.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.28.t:0 "Death of Wilhelm Stieber"
prussia.28.d:0 "Today, on January 29 1882, Prussia's newspapers are reporting the death of Wilhelm Stieber. Born in Merseburg to a noble government official for the Lutheran Ministry, he began studying German law at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin - against his father's wishes. He would later join the Berlin police force and, finding excitement there, quickly climbed the ranks until he was promoted by King Friedrich Wilhelm IV after the Revolution of 1848. Stieber would participate in many intelligence missions, including gathering intel on exiled political extremist Karl Marx. Alhough many despise his methods, his passing will be a loss for Prussia's secret service."
prussia.28.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.29.t:0 "Death of Heinrich Friedrich von Itzenplitz"
prussia.29.d:0 "Heinrich Friedrich von Itzenplitz has been found dead at his manor this morning and will be buried in his family's graveyard at Kunersdorf in a few days from now. Although few would realize his true worth, von Itzenplitz held many jobs during his over twenty years of service as an advisor to the king and the agricultural ministry. Born into the landed gentry of Brandenburg-Prussia, he symbolized the determination and work ethic of the German people. A controversial railway administrator, his work for the government hasn't always been received without criticism and a fraud scandal, for which he was never found guilty, cost him some of his good reputation among the Prussian public. He died peacefully in his sleep and will be mourned by many, may he lay at rest."
prussia.29.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.30.t:0 "Death of Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch"
prussia.30.d:0 "The death of politician and economist Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch leaves the nation in consternation. Studying law at Leipzig and Halle, he went on to organize the world's first credit union and established Germany's first industrial cooperative. Later he also was a co-founder of the 'Deutsche Fortschrittspartei', always trying to support the common people against vicious capitalists. His early political career saw him seated in parliament from 1848-1851, but he left a far greater mark as an advocate of the workers' well-being, being the mastermind behind the passing of the Prussian law of association in 1867. Schulze-Delitzsch laid the groundwork for social welfare in Germany and will be deeply missed by an admiring public."
prussia.30.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.31.t:0 "Death of Alexander von Schleinitz"
prussia.31.d:0 "Unfortunate news reaches the capital today regarding the death of Alexander von Schleinitz. A fervid politician and ambassador, Schleinitz filled many roles in the royal administration during his lifetime. Originating from an aristocratic family from the Margraviate of Meissen and son of the Regierungspräsident of Blankenburg, Schleinitz often shifted between different positions in the ministry. As foreign executive, he negotiated peace with the Danish during the Second Schleswig War and ensured Prussia bolstered its power among the other European countries. He would remain politically active until the 1860s and became Minister of the Royal Household until his demise. Although he often quarreled with the government, he will surely be missed by conservative Prussians."
prussia.31.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.32.t:0 "Death of Maximilian Duncker"
prussia.32.d:0 "Earlier today, politician and historian Maximilian Duncker passed away. Born in Berlin, Duncker studied at the universities of Bonn and Berlin until 1834, where he and fellow students were accused of participating in then-restricted student societies, for which he had to serve a six month prison sentence. He would eventually graduate in 1842 and obtain a professorship for history at Halle University. His political career saw him be elected to both the Frankfurt Parliament in 1848 and later the Erfurt Assembly in 1850, and after that to the Prussian Abgeordnetenhaus. In 1867, he became director of the Prussian archives, tasked with incorporating those of Hanover, Hesse, and Nassau. A close friend to crown prince Friedrich Wilhelm, Duncker will be dearly missed, especially by German liberals."
prussia.32.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.33.t:0 "Death of Alfred Krupp"
prussia.33.d:0 "This day will be remembered in all of Germany, but especially in its industrial heartland at the Ruhr, as famous metalworker and inventor, Alfred Krupp, has passed away. Krupp inherited a failing steel mill on the brink of bankruptcy from his father. Shortly after his father's death, Krupp re-opened the business with a new agenda. Trains were becoming an ever-more prominent means of travel across Europe, and Krupp seized this opportunity and made a fortune in the railroad construction industry. With his kind leadership, he was renowned for the excellent treatment of his workers, offering insurance and housing to the workers for their service. With thoughts on Prussian expansion, Krupp introduced the breech-loading cannon, engineered using cast steel howitzers, to the Prussian court. The king could not see a use and instead used it as a decorative ornament. However, the king's brother, Prince Wilhelm, thought differently.\n\nWhen Wilhelm became regent in 1859, Prussia purchased its first cannon from Krupp. This deal would eventually lead to Krupp becoming the largest arms producer in Germany, earning him the nickname 'Cannon King'. The Prussian people mourn the death of a brilliant mind and manufacturer, but fortunately, Alfred's son Friedrich promised to continue the business in the name of his father."
prussia.33.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.34.t:0 "Death of Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen"
prussia.34.d:0 "Mayor and cooperative pioneer Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen has passed away, shortly before his 70th birthday in Neuwied-Heddesdorf. Born in 1818 at Hamm, Rhineland, Raiffeisen would leave school at the age of 14, go on to receive three years of education from a local pastor before joining the military at 17. After contracting an eye disease, he was forced to resign in 1843 and soon found interest in public service. He went on to become mayor of a number of smaller towns across the Rhineland, when worsening health forced him to resign from his post in 1852. Retiring from his political career, Raiffeisen became a businessman and started a small cigar factory. Famous for his food banks across Prussia, he created the 'Verein für Selbstbeschaffung von Brot und Früchten' (Association for Self-Procurement of Bread and Fruits) during the winter starvation of 1846/47. The association's purpose was to stock food banks and send external profits to caritative usage. Influential in economics, Raiffeisen would further the idea of cooperative self-help during his time as mayor of Flammersfeld, eventually founding the first rural cooperative bank at Neuwied, from where he would go on to expand the business model across Prussia. A hero of the common people, the Prussian public deeply mourns his death."
prussia.34.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.35.t:0 "Death of Maximilian von Forckenbeck"
prussia.35.d:0 "One of Prussia's most prudent and respected mayors, Maximilian von Forckenbeck, has passed away today from pneumonia at the age of 70. Born in Westphalia, he earned a degree in law at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin. Later, he was elected to Prussia's parliament, the Abgeordnetenhaus, as a member of the liberal faction, where he would set out to co-create the 'Deutsche Fortschrittspartei' (German Progress Party) in 1861, which became the first modern political party of Prussia. Forckenbeck took on many titles over the duration of his political career, such as President of the House of Representatives, President of the Reichstag Parliament, and Mayor of Breslau. In 1878, Forckenbeck was elected mayor of Berlin with an overwhelming majority, a position he would hold until his untimely demise. The people of Prussia, and especially the residents of Berlin, will mourn his death and he will be greatly missed by noblemen and commoners alike."
prussia.35.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.36.t:0 "Death of Werner von Siemens"
prussia.36.d:0 "Electrical engineer, inventor, and industrialist Werner von Siemens has passed away. Born into an old and influential family, Siemens intended to study in Berlin, however, his family was highly indebted and could not pay for the expensive school fees. He instead chose to join the Prussian Military Academy School of Artillery and Engineering, where he received his officer's training. A decorated soldier with various medals to his name and famous for his invention of the electrically-charged sea mine, his popularity grew among Prussian circles of power. Upon returning home from his war duties, Siemens chose to start his career in perfecting technologies, working with many famous minds of Europe during this time, the likes of engineer Elkington of Birmingham. Constructing from the ground up one of the largest manufacturing companies across Europe, his businesses continue to grow with the help of his sons who have split the company amongst themselves. With a strong progressive belief and a creative mind, Siemens will be missed by the innovators of Germany."
prussia.36.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.37.t:0 "Death of Hermann von Helmholtz"
prussia.37.d:0 "The brilliant physicist and physician Hermann von Helmholtz has been reported dead. His scientific prowess is unparalleled. He was an innovator in the field of experimental psychology, a revolutionizer of ophthalmology, and he rejected the speculative science of natural philosophy in favor of materialism. With great admiration people referred to him as 'Reich Chancellor of Physics'. Thanks to his skills, determination, and drive for knowledge transfer, his many students will continue to discover more in his name and in the name of Germany. The scientific community in Germany and across the globe will surely miss his towering intellect and the German people mourn his death."
prussia.37.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.38.t:0 "Death of Gustav Freytag"
prussia.38.d:0 "Novelist and playwright Gustav Freytag has passed away earlier today in the city of Wiesbaden. Born in Kreuzburg, Silesia, he attended the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin where he received his degree in philology. With his humorous and articulate writing, Freytag created, among other works, the Prussian comedic play 'The Journalist', which was an instant blockbuster among the German public. After moving permanently to Berlin, he worked closely with Julian Schmidt and founded 'Die Grenzboten', a weekly journal that became the heart of German and Austrian liberalism. His literary fame grew, even internationally, after the publication of 'Soll und Haben' (Debit and Credit). The novel was hailed for its expression of sturdy but unexaggerated realism with the intention of patriotic views for contrast between the homely vultures of the Germans and negative light on Poles and Jews. Freytag's works of art shined bright and will continue to belaud his name, he shall be remembered."
prussia.38.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.39.t:0 "Death of Georg von Bunsen"
prussia.39.d:0 "Reports from London have brought to our attention that liberal politician Georg von Bunsen has passed away. Despite being a prominent member of the liberal movement of Prussia, he strongly supported Bismarck's unification of Germany and was an advocate for a more centralized German state. Bunsen formed and led the German Africa Society during its rise, bringing many African states to the attention of our noble Kaiser. Bunsen's advocacy for German colonialism in Africa eventually led to the establishment of the first German colonies, and, thus, increased Germany's standing in the world. May he rest in peace."
prussia.39.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.40.t:0 "Death of Ludwig Bamberger"
prussia.40.d:0 "Prussian news headlines read about the death of Ludwig Bamberger, a German-Jewish economist, politician, revolutionary, and writer. Born into a wealthy family, his interests in law would take him to the universities of Giessen, Heidelberg, and Göttingen. During the infamous March Revolution of 1848, he would join the Republican uprising in the Palatinate and Baden. After order was restored by local authorities, Bamberger was sentenced to death but managed a last-minute escape to Switzerland with other revolutionaries on the run. Spending time in London, Holland, and Paris, he returned to Prussia after his sentence was lapsed and would climb to director of a minor banking company. A strong supporter of German unification, he got elected to the Reichstag a few years later, where he joined the National Liberal Party.\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War, Bamberger was summoned by the Prussian delegation to help negotiate the terms of peace. Leading the German Reichstag on matters of finance and economics, he was the leading figure behind German currency politics and the formation of the Reichsbank. An advocate for free trade, he opposed conservative policies of protectionism and went on to co-found an association promoting free trade and competition. Bamberger established the foundations of modern banking and will always be remembered for his great achievements."

prussia.41.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.42.t:0 "Death of Wilhelm Liebknecht"
prussia.42.d:0 "Wilhelm Liebknecht, a German socialist politician and principal co-founder of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, has died. A pioneer of Marxist ideals in Germany and abroad, Liebknecht helped set the foundation for the modern German socialist parties. He studied at Giessen, Berlin, and Marburg, where he eventually graduated in philology, theology, and philosophy, hereby concerning himself the writings of St Simon, from which he gained a first interest in communism and its social structure. In late 1848, Liebknecht joined a poorly organized socialist legion in France aiming to instigate revolution in German but would be captured and charged with treason. On the eve of his trial, revolution erupted once more and a mob had him released.\n\nHe would flee to Switzerland and join a socialist league, but after a failed attempt at a workers revolution in Switzerland, and increased pressure from the Prussian government to hand him over, he would flee to London like so many other revolutionaries. During his time in London, Liebknecht joined the Communist League and became a close associate of revolutionary Karl Marx, ruining his remaining reputation with the Prussian government at the time. After returning to Germany, he became acquainted with August Bebel. The duo tried to foment anti-war sentiment after the Franco-Prussian War for which they were arrested and sentenced to two years in prison in one of the most spectacular trials Germany had ever seen. After his release, he was re-elected to the Reichstag in 1874 and Liebknecht would continue his work for socialism in Germany, even after his party had been outlawed. The Prussian elites might believe his death was good riddance, but his revolutionary ideas will live on."
prussia.42.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
prussia.43.t:0 "Death of Rudolf Virchow"
prussia.43.d:0 "The death of Rudolf Virchow deeply saddens the Prussian people. A physician, anthropologist, writer, and politician, Virchow was a true jack-of-all-trades, considered by many to be the father of modern pathology and founder of social medicine, his colleagues would even reverently call him the 'Pope of medicine'. Virchow was born on October 13 1821, in the small town of Schivelbein, Pomerania. The only son of a farmer and representative in local government, he was a naughty child and poorly behaved at home. However, he was a brilliant student and passionate about science, languages, and driven by success.\n\nTaking unpaid assistant work at Charité Hospital, the largest in Berlin, his position allowed access to laboratories, which he used to study during his younger years. Later in his life, Virchow would strive to be a reformist for progress and modernity, coined for creating the phrase: ''Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale.'' Among many great discoveries and writings originating from his place of work, he is mainly credited for the fantastic piece of medical study called 'Zelluläre Pathologie' (Cellular Pathology). With many great advancements in the field of medicine and physics, both the scientific community and the Prussian people in general grieve over his passing."

prussia.44.t:0 "Death of James Hobrecht"
prussia.44.d:0 "Famous German engineer and urban planner James Hobrecht has passed away today in a peaceful slumber. When he was young, he left school to become a geodesist apprentice. Hobrecht would pass his examination in 1845 and continued his studies at the Berliner Bauakademie, the famous technical academy, joining a loose group of students interested in furthering the architectural development of Prussia. His largest project undoubtedly was the so-called Hobrecht-Plan, which he drafted to modernize Berlin's urban infrastructure, streamline the city's future development and establish sanitary standards in the capital. From there, Hobrecht would go on to engineer and modernize city infrastructures across the globe, in cities as prominent as Moscow, Tokyo, and Cairo. After returning to Berlin, he was commissioned by his brother, Arthur Hobrecht, Mayor of Berlin, to build a sewerage system spanning hundreds of square kilometers. His architectural designs helped the capital grow and, even more importantly, provided better sanitation for its citizens. His work will live on and continue to serve the public, who will miss him dearly. May his soul rest in peace."

prussia.45.t:0 "Death of Theodor Mommsen"
prussia.45.d:0 "History shall remember Theodor Mommsen, who unfortunately passed away today. He truly was a diligent historian in the field of classical Greco-Roman history, spending his days examining records and accounts from times way before Christ. He founded the German Archeological Institute and revolutionized historical study with his Nobel-Prize-winning masterpiece 'History of Rome' and was an influential voice in Prussian politics, too. The Prussian public, but the historiographical community in particular, grieves over his death."

prussia.46.t:0 "Death of Friedrich August von Holstein"
prussia.46.d:0 "Friedrich August von Holstein, an administrative modernizer and influential German diplomat, passed away this morning. Holstein started his career studying at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin, where he graduated in 1856. Joining the diplomatic service in 1860, he became an attaché to the Prussian embassy in Saint Petersburg, later serving as a member of the legations at Rio de Janeiro, London, Washington, Florence, and Copenhagen. He had a key influence on foreign policies during the 1890s, including the plans for acquiring German colonies in East Asia, earning him the nickname 'grey eminence'. Holstein shall be remembered for his thrustful execution of foreign policy which galvanised Germany's future as a diplomatic power, and the government mourns his death."

prussia.47.t:0 "Death of August Bebel"
prussia.47.d:0 "Reports are coming in that August Bebel, aged 73, has died of a heart attack. Bebel has alway been a staunch socialist, from his beginnings as a humble worker in the Badenian journeymen's association to his rise in politics as co-founder of the infamous Social Democrat Party of Germany. The mark he left in German politics as one of the earliest and most ardent socialists in the Reichstag is hard to understate. He was a patriot that never voted with the patriots, an atheist who advocated for secularism, and a man who spoke up for those who had no voice. Whilst some will surely be glad Bebel's time is finally over, it is clear that the socialists and many among the common people across Germany and even internationally will mourn his death."

Die Frage, wo die Trauung stattfinden sollte, hatte im Vorfeld viel Kritik hervorgerufen, da von unserer Seite natürlich vorgeschlagen wurde, die Trauung in Berlin abzuhalten. Königin Victoria bestand jedoch mit großem Einfühlungsvermögen darauf, dass die Hochzeit ihrer geliebten Tochter in der Chapel Royal des St. James' Palace in London stattfinden solle. Königin Victoria ließ sich schließlich nicht beirren und setzte sich durch. Diese Hochzeit wird für den preußischen Staat und die Hohenzollern-Dynastie als Ganzes von großem Nutzen sein - außerdem wird sie unsere internationalen Beziehungen zum Vereinigten Königreich verbessern."

prussia.91.d:0 "Since 1836, Alfred Krupp has been offering his long-term employees a voluntary health insurance, paid in half by the employee and the employer respectively. In the beginning, the employer's share had largely been financed through fines that workers had to pay for rule violation, but soon the number of people in the insurance grew and Krupp readily upheld his part of the bargain. In 1855, the employee health insurance became mandatory and Krupp's workers' insurance scheme is rapidly growing to be by far the largest program of its kind in the nation."

Similar to the health insurance policy at Krupp, the workers will have to pay one half of the contributions, whilst the employer pays the other half. Workers that have been with the company for 15 years or more are entitled to a pension. In case of termination of employment, which Krupp tries hard to avoid even in times of economic struggle, all claims are forfeited.\n\nKrupp has also introduced an accident insurance for his workers that they don't need to contribute to at all. If a worker becomes permanently unfit for work due to a workplace accident, he will receive a pension irregardless of how long he's served the company. In case an employee died after more than 15 years of work before receiving a pension, the widow is also entitled to two thirds of her husband's pension claim."

You have to pay in cash in these stores, though, and food stamps and the like are not accepted as payment. Furthermore, terminated employees lose their discount eligibility.\n\nThe Krupp company also operates a number of schools for the children of employees, a hospital and an outdoor swimming pool.

The labour standards are much stricter in Krupp factories than in most other German companies, and workers found guily of breaking the code are subject to severe, although only financial punishment. Krupp employees are generally forbidden to participate in labour strikes and political associations of the working class, like labour unions. Even reading a socialist newspaper can get you fired. After all, Krupp is a businessman and a wealthy industrialist who wants to keep his place and run his business in his way. He's willing to actively seek improvement for his long-term employees in return, though."

Nach der Märzrevolution von 1848/49 baute er geheime Kommunikationsverbindungen mit dem preußischen Außenministerium auf und übermittelte Informationen über Karl Marx und seine Revolutionäre. Den gesammelten Informationen zufolge verkleidete sich Stieber als Arzt und infiltrierte das Londoner Haus von Marx, um wertvolle Informationen über die Identität marxistischer Anhänger in ganz Europa zu erhalten. In seinen Briefen heißt es, er sei früh am Tag zu Marx' Wohnung in der Dean Street 64 aufgebrochen und sei bis Mittag geblieben. Danach ging in die Botschaft in Paris um die gesammelten Informationen weiterzugeben. Obwohl seine Beteiligung an den anschließenden Prozessen weniger lobenswert war, führten seine Dokumente zur Verhaftung vieler Revolutionäre in ganz Europa und versetzten dem Bund der Kommunisten (einer Geheimgesellschaft von Kommunisten und Marxisten) die 1852 gewaltsam aufgelöst wurde, einen verheerenden Schlag."

The architectural commission led by Heinrich Strack immediately got back to the drawing board and is now profiting from their smart design from after the German War.

Three segments, each over 7 metres high and decorated with the barrels of captured cannons from the enemies of the unification wars, form the column's body. On its top at the height of over 50 metres, sits an 8.32 metre bronze sculpture depicting the Roman goddess of victory, Victoria, who wears a Prussian eagle helmet and, thus, resembles Borussia, the female personification of Prussia. In her right hand, she holds a laurel crown that represent the Prussian victories of the past, and in her left hand, she holds a battle standard featuring the Iron Cross, commemorating the accomplishments of the Prussian military."

In fact, tensions between the different factions within the Prussian parliament, which holds the right of appropriation for government funds, eventually reached the point of personal insults. As a last consequence, member of parliament Otto von Bismarck even fought a pistol duel against fellow parliamentarian Georg von Vincke, for which the difference of opinion regarding the financing of the castle's reconstruction was one of the main reasons. Vincke has always been expressing heavy criticism and remains to see the project as an irrelevant waste of money, suggesting that the funds be redirected towards other projects. What should we do?"

#Economy - HISTORICAL (mainly)
PRS_focus_economy:0 "The Prussian Economy"
PRS_focus_economy_desc:0 "For long the Prussian economy has prospered under its own conditions, but we are falling behind in adapting our economy to the trends of industrialization. A state that lags behind in economics lags behind in superiority; this we must recognize."
PRS_focus_state_rail:0 "Preußische Staatseisenbahnen"
PRS_focus_state_rail_desc:0 "We will subsidize the construction of new railway networks across our country - our infrastructure will certainly benefit from this."
PRS_focus_berlin_anhalt_rail:0 "Expand Berlin-Anhalt Railway"
PRS_focus_berlin_anhalt_rail_desc:0 "The Berlin-Anhaltische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft had rapidly expanded the network of railways within our nation. Originally spanning for a mere 20 kilometers, the Berlin-Anhalt railway project has since connected many places with Berlin, and linked with many other railway lines. Connecting the lines from Wittenberg to Bitterfeld will greatly increase the span of the BAE."
PRS_focus_silesia_rail:0 "Expand Silesian Railways"
PRS_focus_silesia_rail_desc:0 "Expanding the current railway network in Silesia will expand our reach to the provinces of southeastern Prussia, which could be vital should we have to confront Austria one day..."
PRS_focus_ostbahn_rail:0 "Finish Preußische Ostbahn"
PRS_focus_ostbahn_rail_desc:0 "We shall finish the grand railway line expanding infrastructure in the east of our country, and thus, finally connecting our capital, Berlin, with the traditional city of the monarch's coronation, Königsberg."
PRS_focus_rhineland_rail:0 "Expand Rhineland Railways"
PRS_focus_rhineland_rail_desc:0 "Expanding the current railway system in the Rhineland and Westphalia will support economic growth, and allow resources to move more swiftly in the western provinces."
PRS_focus_trade_and_commerce:0 "Trade & Commerce"
PRS_focus_trade_and_commerce_desc:0 "We need to support the growth in trade and commerce to secure financial security for our state affairs."
PRS_focus_norswe_zoll:0 "Zollverein Foreign Trade Treaties"
PRS_focus_norswe_zoll_desc:0 "Originally the Zollverein was a customs union intended to connect the German states, remove custom barriers and manage economic policies within its territory. Despite having differences in culture and history, several countries are interested in trading with the Zollverein, and after much discussion it has been agreed that such treaties would ultimately benefit all member states."
PRS_focus_trade_france:0 "Trade Treaty with France"
PRS_focus_trade_france_desc:0 "No matter how we stand with the French, their country is rich, and we could certainly benefit from expanding trade between our nations."
PRS_focus_berliner_borse:0 "Berliner Börse"
PRS_focus_berliner_borse_desc:0 "The Berlin stock exchange is slowly growing in importance. The old venue, however, offers little to no room for expansion. We should find a site for a new building that will represent the rise in esteem of Prussian finance and commerce."
PRS_focus_prussian_consortium:0 "Preußen-Konsortium"
PRS_focus_prussian_consortium_desc:0 "By forming a consortium of the most powerful banks of Prussia, we could dramatically increase the value and security of our state bonds, which, in turn, would give us financial leeway for both domestic and international projects."
PRS_focus_economic_legislation:0 "Economic Legislation"
PRS_focus_economic_legislation_desc:0 "Prussian economic legislation has only just begun to coordinate the practices of trade, commerce, science and industry more rigorously. By expanding, standardizing and centralizing these regulations, we could certainly remove obstacles and prevent exploitation."
PRS_focus_handelsgesetz_law:0 "Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch"
PRS_focus_handelsgesetz_law_desc:0 "While our trade networks and maritime influence is miniscule compared to the colonial powers of the west, the German regions have been structured through centuries of mercantile trade even far before the Hansa. Until now, the exact state of merchants and trade was only vaguely defined or discussed within the government, and with the rise of capitalism and industrialization, our nation now needs to tackle this. The lack of a centralized trade also resembles the disunity of the German states; as the dominant German power, Prussia needs to push ahead. Reforming the drafts suggested in the Paulskirche Constitution should solidify our trade, and unite the German Confederation closer than before."
PRS_focus_borsenordnung:0 "Neue Börsenordnung"
PRS_focus_borsenordnung_desc:0 "With the growth of the equity market comes the necessity for regulation. To prevent economic disruption and to further stimulate growth and stability, we will need to regulate the stock exchanges in Prussia."
PRS_focus_protect_patentordnung:0 "Protect the Patentordnung"
PRS_focus_protect_patentordnung_desc:0 "For far too long, the lack of a copyright law has hindered scientific and cultural advance. Now, advocates of radical free trade are beginning to gather support for an abolition of the Patentordnung, which protects intellectual property concerning inventions. They claim that such legislation hinders economic growth because it prevents inventions from spreading. However, it has been proven in the UK and the US that a patent law actually encourages ingenuity; hence, we must not give in to their demands."
PRS_focus_mining_standards:0 "Preußisches Berggesetz"
PRS_focus_mining_standards_desc:0 "Mining has been a strong factor of German industry and trade even before medieval times, but with the Industrial Era on our doorstep, we need to improve our mining standards. Germany is full of important resources like coal and iron, but the lack of proper standards is hindering our development."
PRS_focus_prussian_urbanization:0 "Prussian Urbanization"
PRS_focus_prussian_urbanization_desc:0 "Although the majority of the Prussian population still lives in the countryside, the percentage of people living in cities is growing rapidly. This process, commonly referred to as urbanization, goes hand in hand with the industrial development of our country, and encouraging it would probably be beneficial."
PRS_focus_execute_hobrecht_plan:0 "Execute Hobrecht Plan"
PRS_focus_execute_hobrecht_plan_desc:0 "Our capital, Berlin, is growing fast. People from the sorrounding countryside and from all over our realm are moving into the city to find work, a better life, or the thrill of living in one of the most dynamic cities of its time. But thousands of incomers naturally cause problems. Luckily for us, we have an expert in urban planning, by the name of James Hobrecht, amongst the city's administrative body."
PRS_focus_encourage_ruhr_urbanization:0 "Encourage Ruhr Urbanization"
PRS_focus_encourage_ruhr_urbanization_desc:0 "Half a century ago rather desolate regions of Germany, the Rhineland and Westphalia were given to Prussia as a consolation prize at the Congress of Vienna of 1815. For a couple of decades now, they have been turning into properous and industrialized centers of Prussia. Especially cities close to the Ruhr river, like Duisburg, Dortmund, or Essen, built on large deposits of coal and other minerals, are growing rapidly. We should try to encourage and channel this internal migration to our benefit."
PRS_focus_encourage_silesian_urbanization:0 "Encourage Silesian Urbanization"
PRS_focus_encourage_silesian_urbanization_desc:0 "Silesia is another industrial heartland of Prussia. Urban centers along the Oder river valley like Breslau, as well as emerging mining districts in the resource-rich hills of Upper Silesia like Kattowitz are contributing to the industrial development of Prussia, a process that we should try to encourage."
PRS_focus_establish_sewerage_standards:0 "Establish Sewerage Standards"
PRS_focus_establish_sewerage_standards_desc:0 "If we want to prevent epidemics and avoid our growing urban centers from turning into sanitary hellholes, we need to establish sewerage standards. Our city planner James Hobrecht has quite some expertise in this area and we should try to capitalize on this."
PRS_focus_prussian_industrialization:0 "Prussian Industrialization"
PRS_focus_prussian_industrialization_desc:0 "While the industrial revolution has come to our nation, most of our economy is still being dominated by pre-industrial business sectors, like agriculture or handcraft. Promoting the industrial development of urban regions will surely support economic growth."
PRS_focus_borsig:0 "Borsig"
PRS_focus_borsig_desc:0 "August Borsig has been in the business of mechanical engineering since 1837, his company now focuses on locomotives. He has recently expanded his factories in the northwest of Berlin, and supporting him in his efforts could help to secure a dominant and stable supplier of much-needed railway equipment."
PRS_focus_krupp_cooperation:0 "Krupp"
PRS_focus_krupp_cooperation_desc:0 "The uneasy balance between state and corporate has proved superiority for the companies, as both their capital and devotion to production is far greater than we will ever be able to achieve on our own. One of the most prominent of these entrepreneurs, Friedrich Krupp, specializes in the production of steel and artillery, and cooperating with him will surely not only increase our militaristic capacities, but also reduce our burden in times of war."
PRS_focus_siemens_halske:0 "Siemens & Halske"
PRS_focus_siemens_halske_desc:0 "Werner Siemens is one of the most innovative minds in the field of telecommunications worldwide. In 1847, he established his business with the precision engineer Johann Georg Halske in the west of Berlin. Since then, the company has experienced dramatic growth, and we could certainly benefit from supporting them in their efforts."
PRS_focus_vulcan_ag:0 "Vulcan AG"
PRS_focus_vulcan_ag_desc:0 "Pomerania, along with the provinces of Berlin and Brandenburg around it, stands as an example of great industrial might within Central Europe, but when compared to the world leaders of industrialization, it still has quite a way to go. One promising company from Stettin is the so-called Vulcan AG, specialized in the ship-building industry. Expanding their factories and subsidising industrial growth in the region should increase our industrial capability greatly."
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle:0 "Dreyse Rifle"
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle_desc:0 "Originally developed by Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse in his manufacture in the Thuringian hinterland, the Dreyse needle gun is a promising bolt action breechloading rifle. If we can manage to mass-produce this technologically superior rifle, we should enjoy a significant advantage on the battlefield."
PRS_focus_spandau_arsenal:0 "Move the Royal Arsenal to Spandau"
PRS_focus_spandau_arsenal_desc:0 "Originally situated in Potsdam, the Königliche Preußische Gewehrfabrique has been the prime supplier for Prussian arms for quite some time now. The factory grounds in Potsdam have reached their capacity though, and the arsenal and its associated factories are currently moving to Spandau, on the western outskirts of Berlin, to allow room for expansion. We will have to complete the move of the Royal Arsenal to the Spandau Citadel in Berlin, so we can increase its military production in the future."
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle_factory:0 "Dreyse Gewehrfabrik"
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle_factory_desc:0 "In order to mass-produce the Dreyse rifle, we will have to support the company in Sömmerda. The developing Dreyse Mill, if subsidised, could eventually produce a lot of firearms for our country."
PRS_focus_suhl_rifle_factories:0 "Suhler Gewehrfabriken"
PRS_focus_suhl_rifle_factories_desc:0 "The small city of Suhl in the middle of Thuringia surprisingly has a rather rich history of rifle manufacturing. The companies of J.P. Sauer & Sohn, C.G. Haenel and Simson & Co. all enjoy a nationwide renown. Investing in these companies could help us to secure reliable and innovative firearm suppliers."
PRS_focus_erfurt_rifle_factory:0 "Königl. Preuß. Gewehrfabrik Erfurt"
PRS_focus_erfurt_rifle_factory_desc:0 "We will try to expand our military industry close to the Thuringian rifle heartlands and establish an arms factory in Erfurt. We hope that the factory site will profit from the expertise and economic infrastructure sorrounding it."
PRS_focus_powerful_economy:0 "Wirtschaftsvormacht"
PRS_focus_powerful_economy_desc:0 "Our powerful economy fuels our universities, and this increases our scientific capabilities."

#Prussian Army - HISTORICAL (incl. ALT-HISTORY foci)
PRS_focus_army_with_state:0 "An Army with a State"
PRS_focus_army_with_state_desc:0 "'Prussia, is not a state with an army, but an army with a state.' - 18th century quote. Prussia has a history of military excellence, let's make our ancestors proud!"
PRS_focus_king_army_prs:0 "Königlich Preußische Armee"
PRS_focus_king_army_prs_desc:0 "Our Royal Army will perform some exercises to keep drilled and performing well. A new general will bring fresh ideas, but we should also reform the Military High Command."

PRS_focus_heeresreform:0 "Heeresreform"
PRS_focus_heeresreform_desc:0 "The Crimean War and the Second Italian War of Independence have proven that our former military might has suffered. Despite a rapidly growing population, our standing army is still the same size it was in 1815. We need to reform the army, if we want to keep our place among the great powers."
PRS_focus_parlamentsheer:0 "Parlamentsheer"
PRS_focus_parlamentsheer_desc:0 "We must strengthen parliamentary control over the military. The law has to take precedence over power, we should reform the army in this spirit."

PRS_focus_promote_landwehr:0 "Promote Landwehr"
PRS_focus_promote_landwehr_desc:0 "The Landwehr has been the backbone of the Befreiungskriege against Napoleon, and it offered great assistance in our attempt of constitutionalization in 1848/49. This is our opportunity to inculcate liberal ideals into the military. This will certainly provoke a conservative backlash, though..." 
PRS_focus_demote_landwehr:0 "Demote Landwehr"
PRS_focus_demote_landwehr_desc:0 "Many members of the Landwehr collaborated with the rebels during the March Revolution of 1848/49. We should demote this unreliable department of our military juggernaut in favor of the regular army. This might be a way to secure both, a majority in parliament and support from the king."
PRS_focus_adjust_draft:0 "Adjust Two-Year Draft"
PRS_focus_adjust_draft_desc:0 "If we enforce the conscription orders more strictly, we might be able to avoid extending the term of service. This might be a way to secure both, a majority in parliament and support from the king."
PRS_focus_expand_draft:0 "Three-Year Draft"
PRS_focus_expand_draft_desc:0 "We need more soldiers, plain and simple. Extending the term of service would ensure a significant increase in manpower for our professional army. This will certainly provoke liberal opposition, though..."
PRS_focus_push_liberal_reform:0 "Push Liberal Reform Bill Through Parliament"
PRS_focus_push_liberal_reform_desc:0 "Parliamentary control over the military is the way forward, the people have spoken. The king may not like this, but he will have to accept the majority decision - or face the consequences!"
PRS_focus_find_compromise:0 "Find Compromise"
PRS_focus_find_compromise_desc:0 "The demotion of the Landwehr and the adjustment of our conscription laws should be an acceptable compromise to parliament and high command. Let's hope the king agrees..."
PRS_focus_enforce_roon_reform:0 "Enforce Roon's Reform Bill"
PRS_focus_enforce_roon_reform_desc:0 "The military is answerable to the king only, not to parliament. These men have proven their loyalty to the crown during the revolution and we will make sure that it stays this way. There can be no compromise here!"
PRS_focus_finish_reform:0 "Finish Army Reform"
PRS_focus_finish_reform_desc:0 "The more detailed reform plans have been carried out. Let's hope they will prove to be effective on the battlefield."

PRS_focus_jade_bight:0 "Jade Bight Port Expansion"
PRS_focus_jade_bight_desc:0 "A few years ago, we bought a piece of land from the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg at the Jade Bight, an ideal location for a deep-water port at the North Sea. Gotthilf Hagen has proposed a plan to develop the spot into a proper navy base. It's time to turn the plan into action and start the construction works."
PRS_focus_build_high_fleet:0 "Build Hochseeflotte"
PRS_focus_build_high_fleet_desc:0 "Our navy's obvious shortcomings during the First Schleswig War are proof enough for the necessity of a genuine deep-sea fleet. If we want to be taken seriously as a great power, we will also have to expand our navy to some extent."

PRS_focus_ngc_navy:0 "Marine des Norddeutschen Bundes"
PRS_focus_ngc_navy_desc:0 "The North German navy forces must continue to grow, if we want to keep our place among the great powers.

PRS_focus_dissolve_parliament:0 "Dissolution of Parliament"
PRS_focus_dissolve_parliament_desc:0 "We have maneuvered into crisis. Decisive action is required to overcome the political standstill and to continue the army reform.

#Country Leader Descriptions
PRS_OTTO_THEODOR_VON_MANTEUFFEL_LEADER_DESC:0 "A highly successful political strongman and staunch pro-constitutional conservative, Otto Theodor von Manteuffel stands as Prussia's most influential proponent of constitutionalism. Having been raised in an aristocratic family, Manteuffel quickly picked up and mastered law and administration during his earlier years, so much so that he even garnered the interest of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. This new favoritism from the king, alongside his eagerness to prove his parliamentary skill, allowed him to gain influence and power within Prussian politics, having been given several different administrative and executive positions of ministry and power throughout his career. Despite his aristocratic connections, however, he was a staunch reformer, going so far as to say that Prussian politics needed to cease being governed 'like the landed estate of a nobleman.' Since December 1850, he has been Prime Minister of Prussia and has made numerous attempts to reform it, none of which have succeeded. Perhaps it's time for a change of guard in the Berliner Wilhelmsstraße?"
PRS_KARL_ANTON_VON_HOHENZOLLERN_SIGMARINGEN_LEADER_DESC:0 "Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is a prominent Junker aristocrat born into the same aristocratic house as King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, the House of Hohenzollern. Having abdicated as ruler of his family's small principality in favor of his distant cousin and close friend, Wilhelm I, he relinquished control of his principality after its annexation into Prussia. Coming from a military lineage, Prince Karl Anton served in the Prussian military and reached the rank of lieutenant general, even obtaining knighthood in the highest Prussian chivalric order, the Order of the Black Eagle. With a prestigious house name and royal lineage behind him, alongside a decorated military career, Karl Anton entered the field of politics and quickly rose to prominence within the Prussian political landscape. His and Wilhelm I's growing influence and ambitions within the Kingdom of Prussia and its nobility have become the center stage of Prussian politics, with many rallying to their side against Manteuffel's rule."
PRS_ADOLF_ZU_HOHENLOHE_INGELFINGEN_LEADER_DESC:0 "Born to a noble family of military lineage, Prince Adolf Karl Friedrich Ludwig zu Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen served as both a 2nd lieutenant in the German Campaign of 1813 and as a member of the Prussian parliament from 1847-1854. Fiercely opposing any reforms made by the parliamentary conservatives and the popular liberal party, and being a staunch feudal-conservative, he advocates for Junker supremacy in German politics over the reforms of the more liberal bureaucratic-conservative and liberal-conservative parties of the 'New Era'. However, despite his decorated career, Prince Adolf Karl remains an inexperienced, albeit ambitious, politician."
PRS_OTTO_VON_BISMARCK_LEADER_DESC:0 "Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck was born on April 1, 1815, at his family's estate in the Prussian heartland west of Berlin. His family is of fifth-generation Junker aristocracy, and his mother comes from a long bloodline of successful academics and government ministers. Bismarck is known for the underplaying of his past, considerable intellect, and cosmopolitan outlook. Educated in Berlin and graduated from university, he took a series of minor diplomatic posts before retiring at age 24 to help run his family's estate in the village of Kneiphof. In 1847, he married Johanna von Puttkamer, the Duchess of Lauenburg and a Prussian noblewoman. Assigned as a delegate to the new Prussian parliament, where he would emerge as a reactionary voice against the anti-autocratic Revolution of 1848/49. His latest career has been as a Prussian diplomat, traveling Europe from St. Petersburg to Paris, giving him valuable insight into these two nations that Prussia is framed by, while attending conferences with French Emperor Napoleon III, and Tsar Alexander II. He also used to be the Prussian ambassador to the German Confederation in Frankfurt. His previous positions in Prussian, and the larger German politics, have given him great influence in political circles, which he has used to his advantage. Although feared by most moderate delegates for his staunchly conservative attitude, his ambitious ideas and revolutionary thinking may very well hold a few surprises in store."
PRS_FRIEDRICH_III_LEADER_DESC:0 "Son of King Wilhelm I and nephew of the late King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, young Friedrich was raised in the traditional Prussian way, involving both military and classical education. His experiences during the tumultuous period of the German Vormärz and his parents' failing marriage meant that the prince soon broke with the Hohenzollern tradition and pursued a formal education at the University of Bonn, in the heart of the more liberal Prussian Rhine Province. Here, Friedrich became acquainted with the liberal arts and progressive forms of governing, forming his rather liberal outlook on Prussian and German politics as a whole - a controversial stance among noblemen from high aristocracy. Both, his political persuasion and the engagement to Victoria, Princess Royal of the British Crown, were encouraged by monarchs of related families such as King Leopold I of Belgium and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Prince Consort to Queen Victoria, in an attempt to liberalize the Kingdom of Prussia and Germany from the inside. The young monarch now holds the keys to Prussia's future and only time will tell whether he can fulfill his destiny..."
PRS_GEORG_VON_VINCKE_LEADER_DESC:0 "Born in May 1811 in the Rhineland city of Hagen, von Vincke has build a formidable career as a politician, officer, landowner and high noble in the Kingdom of Prussia. Having studied at the Unversity of Berlin and later at Göttingen, he served one year in the army voluntarily, and thereafter worked at courts in Berlin, Minden, and Münster. During the March Revolution of 1848/49, he we was a representative for Westphalia in the Frankfurt Parliment, where he would join the influential so-called 'Café Milani' faction. Regarded as a famous orator with his excellent writing skills and public voice, he would serve many jobs as a public speaker. Although an avid supporter of conservative values, he would change his political approach after Otto Theodor von Manteuffel took office as Prussian prime minister and turned into one of his most outspoken critics. An opponent of the Prussian envoy to the National Assembly in Frankfurt, Otto von Bismarck, the two nobleman duelled with pistols in 1852, which both men left without injury. Vincke has tried again and again to gain office as Prussian prime minister. Particularly with his anti-Polish stance many Prussians supported him for the office - and now it is time to prove himself worthy of this premature praise."
PRS_EDUARD_SIMSON_LEADER_DESC:0 "Born 1810 in Königsberg, East Prussia, into a Jewish family, Simson entered university in 1826 as a student of jurisprudence and law. He was most interested in Roman Law and even spent a year in Berlin to learn more on the topic, graduating with a Doctor Juris, after attending the École de Droit in Paris. Being a lead figure in both the Frankfurt Parliament and the short-lived Erfurt Parliament of 1850, he still exerts high influence in the Kingdom of Prussia. With many influential roles across his career, he has become a well-known figure in Prussian politics and jurisdictions."
PRS_RUDOLF_VIRCHOW_LEADER_DESC:0 "Rudolf Virchow was born October 13, 1821, in the town of Schivelbein. The only son of his father, a farmer, and a representative in local government, he was a naughty child and poorly behaved. But, he was scholastically brilliant and showed much affection towards his talents in science, languages, and hard work. Taking unpaid assistant work at the Charité Hospital, the largest in Berlin, his position allowed him access to laboratories to pursue his studies. As a renowned reformer for modernity, he coined the phrase: 'Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale'. Being a co-founder of the 'Deutsche Fortschrittspartei', he has also proven his abilities and ambition in Prussian politics, and is being held in high regard across the political spectrum."
PRS_AUGUST_VON_DER_HEYDT_LEADER_DESC:0 "An influential German economist, August von der Heydt has held high positions in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, formed after the Revolutions of 1848. Born in 1801 in Elberfeld, Duchy of Berg, August was a smart student and soon rose up the ranks, being appointed by King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. Starting in 1848, he has been in control of the nationalization of many private railway lines, having already bought a few in the name of the 'Preußische Staatseisenbahnen'. While attaining existing lines, he has also laid out plans to expand the railway network across the Kingdom of Prussia. He was also responsible for managing most of the taxes across the country, reforming the mining industry by lowering the average tax, breaking up mining guilds, and ending state supervision. With his economic prowess, he has also helped increasing the circulation of currency, slowly replacing barter for currency trading and making the 'Vereinstaler' a valuable key currency in the Zollverein."
