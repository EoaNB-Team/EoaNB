 ### IDEAS ###
 THU_idea_bastion_of_particularism: "Bastion of Particularism"
 THU_idea_bastion_of_particularism_desc: "In the mid-19th century, Thuringia is not yet an unified state but consists of eight separate independent countries with their own governments and royal families, as well as Prussian and Hessian exclaves. The region remains a peculiar remnant of the Holy Roman Empire, divided between the Ernestine cadet branches of the House of Saxony and two other dynasties. Politically, the Thuringian duchies and principalities have little agency of their own, most heavily influenced by either Prussia or Austria. With German nationalism on the rise, change might be on the horizon. Indeed, some of the states have begun sharing courts and administrative institutions in the past years."
 THU_idea_wartburg: "The Wartburg"
 THU_idea_wartburg_desc: "The Wartburg towers above Eisenach in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, right at the Hessian border. It was first mentioned in 1080 and is undoubtedly one of Germany's most famous and romantic castles, known for hosting Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, Martin Luther and the great Goethe. In the past centuries, it has fallen into a state of disrepair. Nevertheless, it is seen as a German national symbol and therefore attracts nationalist fraternities. Every year, patriotic students and professors meet at the castle to protest against reactionary politics and for German unification."
 THU_idea_germanies_green_heart: "Germany's Green Heart"
 THU_idea_germanies_green_heart_desc: "From the Werra to the Saale, from the Thuringian Forest in the south to the Harz in the north, Thuringia is famous for its nature and the local population is increasingly aware of its touristic potential. The Rennsteig, once a path for messengers high in the southern mountains, now attracts more and more hikers and naturalists."
 THU_idea_university_of_jena: "The University of Jena"
 THU_idea_university_of_jena_desc: "The University of Jena, founded in 1557, is not one of Germany's oldest universities, but certainly one of its most influential and prestigious ones. It belongs to all four Ernestine duchies and counts many famous scientists and philosophers among its alumni. Jena is a center of the German unification movement, it is the place where the Urburschenschaft, Germany's first openly nationalist student fraternity, was founded in 1817."
 THU_idea_international_cultural_center: "International Cultural Center"
 THU_idea_international_cultural_center_desc: "From the founder of Protestantism, Martin Luther, to composers Franz Liszt and Johann Sebastian Bach and the two greatest authors in German history, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich von Schiller, many men found in German history books today came from Thuringia or worked there.
