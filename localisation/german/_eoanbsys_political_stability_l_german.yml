 ###GENERAL EVENTS###
 pssystem.0.t: "Riots in the Streets!"
 pssystem.0.d: "As of late our government has been losing political influence in our country. The people, not content with the weak and unstable [Root.GetRulingParty] as our current main governmental body and incited by our political enemies, have abandoned their work and go on the streets, protesting and rioting against us. If we want to resolve this troubling situation, we must act now and raise our Political Stability."
 pssystem.0.a: "This is only temporary."
 pssystem.1.t: "Big-Scale Protests!"
 pssystem.1.d: "Observing how our Political Stability has been only getting worse, the [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] people have now formed major protests against our government, backed by the politically opposing forces. They claim that the current political crisis in our country is proof of the shaky and unstable [Root.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] governing body. If we let this problem be, it could tear our country apart."
 pssystem.1.a: "This is starting to get irritating."
 pssystem.2.t: "Fighting in the Streets!"
 pssystem.2.d: "After a police officer inadvertently killed a protester that was harassing him, the situation is now finally escalating. Almost on every major street fighting is taking place between our executive forces, consisting mainly of the military and police, and the people. The people demand the current government to step down and a new one to be elected."
 pssystem.2.a: "Hopefully we will overcome this crisis."
 pssystem.3.t: "Call for Civil War!"
 pssystem.3.d: "Seeing no end to the fighting, the people of [Root.GetNameDef] have officially called for a civil war against us. In contrast to the irrational fighting, coordinated combat is now taking place on the very streets of our cities. This is not a matter of workforce protests anymore, it is a matter of life and death."
 pssystem.3.a: "May God help us."
 pssystem.25.t: "Call for Takeover"
 pssystem.25.d: "Seeing no end to the fighting, the people of [Root.GetNameDef] have officially called for a forceful takeover of the government. Militias have already taken over most of our governmental institutions. Coordinated combat is now taking place on the very streets of our cities, with the goal of forcing out our own military forces. It is now a matter of time before the new government gets proclaimed, and if we fail to somehow partly contain this situation until then, we will forever lose control."
 pssystem.25.a: "May God help us."
 pssystem.26.t: "Call for Takeover Dampens"
 pssystem.26.d: "Even if fights on the streets are still a regular sight, organized aggression against the governmental institutions is no more. The ones who collectively called for a takeover have been arrested or killed during clashes with our forces. We still have a long way to go, but a silver lining on the horizon can now be seen."
 pssystem.26.a: "Thank god."
 pssystem.28.t: "Collectivist Socialist Takeover Succeeds!"
 pssystem.28.d: "It is officially over. The collectivist forces have successfully taken most of the governmental institutions and pushed our forces out of the big cities and towns. Creating their own institutions, the collectivists have established a new type of government, a type of government they have fought for."
 pssystem.28.a: "So, we're the [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] collectivist socialists now..."
 pssystem.29.t: "Radical Democratic Takeover Succeeds!"
 pssystem.29.d: "It is officially over. The radical forces have successfully taken most of the governmental institutions and pushed our forces out of the big cities and towns. Creating their own institutions, the radicals have established a new type of government, a type of government they have fought for."
 pssystem.29.a: "So, we're the [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] radical democracy now..."
 pssystem.30.t: "Takeover Avoided!"
 pssystem.30.d: "With the help of our military forces, we have successfully defended our governmental institutions and officials, forcing some of the rioters to retreat. Overwhelmed by our remaining military power, the rioters are withdrawing and as such our government is safe, at least for now."
 pssystem.30.a: "We barely made it..."
 pssystem.4.t: "Call for Civil War Dampens"
 pssystem.4.d: "Even if fights on the streets are still a regular sight, organized aggression is no more. The ones who collectively called for a civil war have been arrested or killed during clashes with our forces. We still have a long way to go, but a silver lining on the horizon can now be seen."
 pssystem.4.a: "Thank god."
 pssystem.5.t: "Fights in the Streets Stop"
 pssystem.5.d: "As our political climate has been slowly but steadily improving, the people seem to be calming down for the first time. Fighting gets rarer by the minute, with our forces and police ensuring the safety of our state. Hopefully all will get better with some more time."
 pssystem.5.a: "We will eventually recover."
 pssystem.6.t: "Big-Scale Protests Quiet Down"
 pssystem.6.d: "Because of how we managed to correct the political situation we were in, fighting has de facto stopped. Big protests are nevertheless a common thing to behold, but the worst seems to be over. One wrong step, however, and we will find ourselves in the mess we have been before."
 pssystem.6.a: "We are almost back on track."
 pssystem.7.t: "Riots gone from the Streets"
 pssystem.7.d: "The situation in [Root.GetNameDef] seems to have finally stabilized, with only small leftovers of protesters on the streets. As we managed to raise Political Stability of our country to its former standards, workers from all around the nation head back to the factories and farms. The situation is lastly resolved."
 pssystem.7.a: "We hope it is over."
 pssystem.8.t: "High Political Stability!"
 pssystem.8.d: "Recently our sphere of influence in our country had spread yet again, furthering our political grasp. Our policies rarely get denied and thanks to our guidance, [Root.GetNameDef] is in a politically stable stance."
 pssystem.8.a: "This is proof of our efficiency."
 pssystem.9.t: "Political Stability Falls"
 pssystem.9.d: "Having enjoyed great political influence in the past weeks, our government now faced a few difficulties when trying to pass new policies. Perhaps being a sign that our way of ruling has become a bit too lax, we have to accept the fact that the current political climate does not allow for errors anymore."
 pssystem.9.a: "This reeks of opposition."
 pssystem.10.t: "Opposition Rises"
 pssystem.10.d: "Recently we have received word that the political opposition in our country is on the rise again. Multiple associations and small organizations begin to move inside the government, hindering our rule over [Root.GetNameDef]. Even if these oppositions are tiny at the moment, we should be on guard."
 pssystem.10.a: "So what? We're the only ones who can rule [Root.GetNameDef]."
 pssystem.11.t: "Opposition Sinks"
 pssystem.11.d: "It did not come to anyone as a surprise, but many governmental politicians who tried to oppose [Root.GetRulingParty] have quieted down, thanks to our efforts. However, it is to be assumed that there still are people who would like to see somebody else as the leader of [From.GetNameDef] than [Root.GetLeader]."
 pssystem.11.a: "They've accepted the factual truth."
 pssystem.12.t: "Overwhelming Political Stability"
 pssystem.12.d: "Not having experienced any difficulties, our government by now is known as a very stable one among our neighbours. Passing laws is nowhere close to a troublesome process anymore, but instead a fast and efficient routine. [Root.GetName] is truly in a period of political prosperity."
 pssystem.12.a: "We have a bright future ahead of us."
 pssystem.13.t: "No Opposition Left"
 pssystem.13.d: "The opposition to the current governing body of [Root.GetNameDef] is now de facto non-existent. Every single politician supports us, or at least is not against us, making the political climate in our country very relaxed."
 pssystem.13.a: "[Root.GetNameDef] is great!"
 pssystem.14.t: "Underwhelming Political Stability"
 pssystem.14.d: "The \"Period of political prosperity\" in [Root.GetName] seemingly ended today, with a resurgence of politicians and writers, criticizing the current political state of [Root.GetName]. Laws are yet again a topic to fight about and the [Root.GetRulingIdeology] of [Root.GetRulingParty] will have to put up with difficulties."
 pssystem.14.a: "We have to move forward."
 pssystem.15.t: "Opposition Returns"
 pssystem.15.d: "As if out of the blue, a few political voices of discontent rang throughout [Root.GetNameDef]. It was simply too good to be true; the Political Stability the government of [Root.GetNameDef] enjoyed lasted for some time, only to lose some Stability later. Still, many are not worried about this event, seeing how the Political Stability within [Root.GetName] remains relatively high."
 pssystem.15.a: "What went wrong?"
 
 ###YEARLY EVENTS###
 eoanb_tt_pswarning: "§YThis will have an impact on your politcal stability. Different ideologies will have different effects.§!"
 pssystem.17.t: "[Root.GetLeader] Speaks to the Nation"
 pssystem.17.d: "Today is the day on which [Root.GetLeader] is going to give a speech to our people. The procedure is expected to go smoothly, seeing how our government has been very stable in the last months. This period of stability has allowed various policies and initiatives to flourish, creating an environment of progress and optimism.\n\nAs [Root.GetLeader] prepares to address the nation, there is a sense of anticipation among the populace. The speech is likely to highlight recent achievements and outline future plans, reinforcing the government's commitment to the well-being and prosperity of the country. This event serves as a moment to reflect on our collective progress and the stable foundation that has been built."
 pssystem.17.a: "The people will love it."
 pssystem.18.d: "Soon [Root.GetLeader] is going to give a speech to our people. Although unsure about the content, [Root.GetLeader] has sought advice, even though the speech is expected to go smoothly. This collaborative approach indicates a desire to ensure the address resonates with the concerns and aspirations of the citizens.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the speech's content, the atmosphere remains calm and optimistic. The government's recent track record of stability provides a reassuring backdrop, suggesting that [Root.GetLeader]'s address will be met with understanding and support. This forthcoming speech is seen as a crucial moment to connect with the people and chart a path forward."
 pssystem.18.a: "This whole thing is merely symbolic, the content itself is irrelevant."
 pssystem.18.b: "[Root.GetLeader] should take a careful approach."
 pssystem.19.d: "Soon [Root.GetLeader] is going to address our people in a speech. In light of improving times in our political climate, multiple close politicians are debating over which approach [Root.GetLeader] should take. This debate reflects the dynamic nature of our leadership and the varied perspectives on guiding the nation towards continued stability and progress.\n\nAs the speech approaches, anticipation builds about the direction [Root.GetLeader] will choose. The differing opinions among politicians highlight the robust dialogue within our political landscape, emphasizing the importance of this upcoming address in shaping the nation's future. This moment captures the essence of our current political discourse and the collaborative effort to ensure continued prosperity."
 pssystem.19.a: "Play it safe and focus on the people."
 pssystem.19.b: "A speech should always rally support. Focus on our neighbours."

 pssystem.20.d: "Tomorrow [Root.GetLeader] will be holding a speech. While preparing for it, we were asked by [Root.GetLeader] for some minor advise. If the speech is to go wrong, the opposition could take this as a chance to gain some influence."
 pssystem.20.a: "The opposition should be mentioned, but not given too much attention."
 pssystem.20.b: "Don't mention the opposition. It could agitate them."
 pssystem.20.c: "The speech should directly address the opposition."
 pssystem.21.d: "In a few days [Root.GetLeader] will give a speech, in an attempt to lower the ever-rising influence of the opposition. If [Root.GetLeader] succeeds in redirecting the focus of the people back to us, it could benefit our political climate immensely."
 pssystem.21.a: "We don't care about the opposition, as long as we're still here."
 pssystem.21.b: "We have to directly engage the opposition."
 pssystem.21.c: "Mention recent problems and how we plan on solving them."
 pssystem.22.d: "As [Root.GetLeader] will be holding a speech in the coming days, planning on regaining some political influence, there are multiple ways on how to approach it. Many think that even if [Root.GetLeader] succeeds in gaining some momentary influence, a speech alone will not be enough to smooth out the political climate inside our country."
 pssystem.22.a: "Just you see, this one speech will be a turnaround for our country."
 pssystem.22.b: "We have to make promises to our people, even if they seem ridiculous at first."
 pssystem.22.c: "Try to blame the opposition for our current state."
 pssystem.23.d: "As the Political Stability in our country seems to be at an all-time low, [Root.GetLeader] will hold a speech and try to soothe and calm our people. We have to act quickly, else it is possible that the whole of the current governmental structure could come tumbling down. We need to decide what the speech will contain."
 pssystem.23.a: "We have to hold on to what remains."
 pssystem.23.b: "Calm the people and try to win them over."
 pssystem.23.c: "We have to search for a scapegoat."
 pssystem.23.e: "The main problem is the opposition. We're not the ones responsible for all this mess."
 pssystem.24.d: "The Political Stability in our country is in a dire state. While all our politicians are busy trying to regain political influence and power, [Root.GetLeader] has decided that it would be a good idea to publish an open letter to the people."
 pssystem.24.a: "The letter should promise prosperity, if the people turn back and support us."
 pssystem.24.b: "The letter could be used as propaganda, so that patriots will stay by our side."
 pssystem.24.c: "The letter should be structured like a speech, while trying to rally some people behind us."
 pssystem.24.e: "The letter should be personally written by [Root.GetLeader], to show how much we care."
 
 pssystem.99.t: "[Root.GetLeader]'s Speech"
 pssystem.99.d: "Due to the military junta currently holding all power within our government, [Root.GetLeader]'s speech, originally scheduled to be held today, seems to have been forcefully rescheduled. Not to mention that our leader's whereabouts are currently unknown, likewise thanks to the junta."
 pssystem.99.a: "Insolent fools!"
