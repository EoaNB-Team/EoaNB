We must expand our tea trade operations, especialy with China."

 #Sale Chain
 alyaska.1.t: "Burden of Alyaska"
 alyaska.1.d: "It seems that economic situation in our American colonies finaly reached its bottom. While RAC's clercs ary trying to sway the government to give subsidies to colony, many officials, especialy liberly-minded, consider Alyaska as burden and reccomend to finally sell it. Anyway, solution for the crisis must be found soon."
 alyaska.1.a: "We will consider our options."
 alyaska.2.t: "Selling Debate"
 alyaska.2.d: "Sell of Alyaska was first duggested during Crimean War by former governor of East Siberia count Muravyov-Amurskiy. He stated, that Alyaska is too insecure for british treat and will anyway be goal of US american expantion in the future. Selling off it Russia will not only recieve great ammount of such needed cash, but improve its relations with eventual buyer and secure russian standing on Pacific in the same time.\n\nHis arguements are still relevant today and recieve support of reformists with naval minister count Konstantin Romanov and finance minister count Reutern on helm. There are also many, who stand against sale, most notably foreign minister count Alexander Gorchakov. They insist on keeping our holding on Alyaska and turn it into our outpost in Wester Hemisphere.\n\nHowever, the final decision is yours, your Majesty. What do we do?"
 alyaska.2.a: "Sell!"
 alyaska.2.b: "Keep!"
 alyaska.3.t: "Contacting the Americans"
 alyaska.3.d: "United States are best candidate to buy Alyaska. They close geographicaly, influencial in Americas and, most importantly, more or less friendly to us. This offer might lead to great venture for us all."
 alyaska.3.a: "Send them a message."
 alyaska.4.t: "Russian representatives offering sale of Alyaska"
 alyaska.4.d: "Today we have recieved an interesting proposal. Russian envoy Eduard de Stoeckl submitted the offer by Russian Empire to sell us their colony of Alyaska. The price is considered to be not too high and additional land has never harmed anyone. Should we agree to their proposal?"
 alyaska.4.a: "We agree to this offer"
 alyaska.4.b: "We are not interested"
 alyaska.5.t: "Americans agreed to buy Alyaska!"
 alyaska.5.d: "Our embassy in Washington informs us that our offer to sell Alyaska to United States was considered interesting by american government. In no time we will start talks about sale price and following actions."
 alyaska.5.a: "Prepare the banking transfers."
 alyaska.6.t: "Americans are not interested in purchase pf Alyaska!"
 alyaska.6.d: "Our embassy in Washington informs us that our offer to sell Alyaska to United States wasn't considered interesting by american government. We have different options how to react on this matter. We may try to convince them by bribing some influencial policymakers, which will campaign for our offer. It will definetly reduce netto gain from the sell, but some money is better than no money at all, right?"
 alyaska.6.a: "We have to try to "convince" them."
 alyaska.7.t: "Russians campaigning for sale of Alyaska?"
 alyaska.7.d: "Alyska affair didn't disappear after our decision to decline russian sale offer. Lately our State Secretary William H. Seward seems to be very optimistic about possible acquirement of Alyaska, which will support our Manifest Destiny, strategic standing on Pacific and, in theory, will lead to acquirement of Brititsh Columbia. However, there are many gossips that Seward was just bribed by russian government to support their will to sell of unprofitable colony or just tries to improve his public image.\n\nThere are no solid proofs of Seward being corrupted and his points are quite reasonable. Shouldn't we reconsider our stance on sale offer?"
 alyaska.7.a: "On the second thought, it is not a bad idea."
 alyaska.7.b: "We allready told, that we are not interested."
 alyaska.8.t: "Americans are still no interested in purchase pf Alyaska!"
 alyaska.8.d: "Even with our best efforts, the Americans are still indifferent towards our sale offer, which depressed many sale supporters considerably. There are not much options left, the most reasonable one are the British. They are our rivals, to be sure, but money is money and sale of additional colony may warm up our relations for a bit. However, this option is considered unpatriotic by many our councelors and may be recieved badly by public. Should we tell our envoy in London to make an offer or maybe we keep luckluster colony and so something ourselves?"
 alyaska.8.a: "Fine, let us contact the British instead."
 alyaska.8.b: "If yankees are not interested we will keep it."
 alyaska.9.t: "Russian representatives offering sale of Alyaska"
 alyaska.9.d: "Today we have recieved an interesting proposal. Russian envoy Philipp Brunnov submitted the offer by Russian Empire to sell us their colony of Alyaska. The price is considered to be not too high and additional land has never harmed anyone. Should we agree to their proposal?"
 alyaska.9.a: "We agree to this offer"
 alyaska.9.b: "We are not interested"
 alyaska.10.t: "British agreed to buy Alyaska!"
 alyaska.10.d: "Our embassy in London informs us that our offer to sell Alyaska to United Kingdom was considered interesting by british government. In no time we will start talks about sale price and following actions."
 alyaska.10.a: "Prepare the banking transfers."
 alyaska.11.t: "British are not interested in purchase pf Alyaska too!"
 alyaska.11.d: "Our embassy in London informs us that our offer to sell Alyaska to United Kingdom wasn't considered interesting by british government. We are running out of options and the voice of those who insist on reforms in colony and its development is getting louder. There is no reason to continue search for buyer, we will have to considering or coming reform in Alyaska."
 alyaska.11.a: "We will bear this burden by ourselves then."
 alyaska.12.t: "Reorganisation of Alyaskan Administration"
 alyaska.12.d: "After our decision to reorganise our american possesions extensive reform of Alyaskan administration will be carried out. Instead of colonial monololy, civilian administration under governor-general will be established, while RAC will continue its operations as private company, specialised on transportations and fur trade."
 alyaska.12.a: "Lots of work ahead"
 alyaska.13.t: "Reorganisation of Alaskan Administration"
 alyaska.13.d: "After purchase of Alaska from Russia we will start the process of incorporating new lands in our administrative system, as Alyaska Department under military governor will be established, wich will oversee transition process and RAC's transfer."
 alyaska.13.a: "Lots of work ahead"
 alyaska.14.t: "Reorganisation of Alaskan Administration"
 alyaska.14.d: "After purchase of Alaska from Russia we will start the process of incorporating new lands in our administrative system, as new territories will be transfered into our colonial administration in Canada."
 alyaska.14.a: "Lots of work ahead"

 alyaska.101.t: "Economic Dead End"
 alyaska.101.d: "The more RAC tried, the more obvious it was that companies ventures are not fixable. Even with expanded recource extraction and trade the Company fails to meet its end loose as the hole in budgets is continuing to expand. RAC employees will continue to keep it afloat but something tells us that government in St.Petersburg will now way less optimistic about continuation of RAC operations and probably will desire to sell it with all the land as profitablitiy of Alyaska for Russia becomes even more questionable."
 alyaska.101.a: "Most concerning"

 #Ideas
 ALK_idea_ice_treaty: "Ice Treaty"
 ALK_idea_ice_treaty_desc: "It is somewhat shamefull, but one of the main revenue routes for RAC is ice trade with american West Coast. This is not a very good venture and competition is high, but money is money."
 ALK_idea_tea_trade: "Tea Trade"
 ALK_idea_tea_trade_desc: "Tea trade is rather new sphere for RAC, but it is allready generating lots of profits, which helps Company to patch the hole in its budget for a bit."
 ALK_idea_alyaska_reorganised: "Reorganised Colony"
 ALK_idea_alyaska_reorganised_desc: "Results of 70 years of RAC's monopoly on Alyaska were considered uninspiring and new colonial administration was setted up. From now on, Alyaska enters new chapter in its history."
