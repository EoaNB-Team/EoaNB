# LEADERS DESCRIPTION

  POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_II_IBN_AL_HUSAYN: "Muhammad II is the Eleventh Bey of the Husainid Dynasty. As Heir Apparent, he had excelled in military affairs and earned the rank of Divisional General within the Ottoman Army in August 1840. He was further promoted to Marshal shortly after he succeeded his cousin Ahmad Bey on the 30th of May, 1855."
  POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_III_AL_SADIQ: "Muhammad III, the Righteous, is the Twelfth Bey of Tunisia. He was 'Bey al-Mahalla' from the 10th of June 1855 to the 23rd of September  1859. The same day he was heir apparent, he was appointed Divisional General in the Imperial Ottoman Army. After the death of his brother, Muhammad II ibn al Husayn, Muhammad III took over as Bey as his nephew was too young at the time to rule, although he did end up adopting him. There are rumours about the British consul trying to persuade him to set up the first official printing press ..."
