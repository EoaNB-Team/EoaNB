 USA_Spirit_Memories_of_Confederation: "Memories of the Confederation"
 USA_Spirit_Memories_of_Confederation_desc: "When we toppled British control over our people, our country faced its greatest challenge it had yet faced, and nearly died because of it. The regionalism of the states separated them from each other, creating rivalries between themselves. This tore into the young republic, as states refused to pay taxes and the army was threatening to mutiny. Many consider it a miracle that our nation survived such times, and it was because of the disposal of the Articles of Confederation, and its replacement by the Constitution. \n \nHowever, it would be an incorrect statement to say the regionalist ideals died out. Many within the country first consider themselves of their state, secondly of their region, and thirdly as an American. Some still see us as more of an Alliance, rather than a nation. After all, it is not 'the' United States, it is 'these' United States."

 acw_generic.80.d: "With John Breckinridge's recent victory in the 1860 election, many parts of the North are extremely sour about the direction the country is heading. Being free states, they're all concerned about Breckinridge's pro-slavery rhetoric from the campaign trail, particularly his support of the expansion of slavery into the territories and possibly beyond. With his victory speech coming up, there are some advisors suggesting that the president-elect take a softer tone on the expansion of slavery while other say that since we won the election, we have no need to seek support from the Northerners."
 acw_generic.80.a: "Take a softer tone"
 acw_generic.80.b: "They lost. We won. Who cares what they think?"

 acw_generic.81.d: "With the unprecedented election of Vice President John C. Breckinridge, many cities in the north have been engulfed in protests or outright rioting.

 acw_generic.82.a: "These troublemakers!"
 acw_generic.83.t: "14 Dead in Columbus Riots"
 acw_generic.83.d: "14 Individuals died, this morning, many more injured as much of downtown Columbus, Ohio went up in flames. While the cause of the fire is still unknown, many are attributing to the zealous abolitionist protests that had captured the city and many more across the north."
 acw_generic.83.a: "We must find the perpetrators and rebuild."
 acw_generic.84.t: "Gunshots In Washington"
 acw_generic.84.d: "Today, President-elect John C. Breckinridge gave his inauguration address as normal.

Fremont in hopes of gaining the trusts of the South. \n \n'There are dangers to the legal persecution of political rivals,' Maine Senator Hannibal Hamlin stated in a briefing. It has been made clear that a government in Washington, no matter which party, could be trusted to instill the Rights of Men. A second revolution must occur.` \n \nThe Abolitionist rebels have been able to establish a foothold in New England and it will only be a matter of time before the rebellion becomes out of our control, lest we address it immediately."

 acw_generic.89.t: "Protests In Boston"

 acw_generic.91.desc: "The Republican candidate for the 1860 election, Abraham Lincoln, released a scathing denouncement of president Breckinridge's policy on slavery.

 acw_generic.92.t: "Douglas' Compromise Amendment"
 acw_generic.92.desc: "Northern Democrat, Stephen Arnold Douglas has proposed the creation of an amendment to the constitution that would mandate that half of the states in the Union be free, and half be open to slavery.

 acw_generic.93.t: "Slavery Expansion Executive Order Leaked!"
 acw_generic.93.desc: "Sir, the papers are reporting that apparently there's been a leaked copy of the text in an executive order you're writing.

 acw_generic.95.t: "Leaked Executive Order Proven Real"
 acw_generic.95.desc: "The worst has happened. An independent investigation into the suspected executive order drafted by the president. This anonymous investigator has found out that the executive order is in fact real and thus released the details of their report to the public.

 acw_generic.96.t: "African-Americans Being Kidnapped At Higher Rates"
 acw_generic.96.desc: "Recent reports from local police departments are showing higher instances of black people being kidnapped.

 acw_generic.98.t: "Winfield Scott and John E. Wool Retire"
 acw_generic.98.desc: "Longtime Generals Winfield Scott and John E. Wool have retired from their positions as generals of the United States Army. Their retirements appear to be motivated by the unrest in the country and possible civil war. For Wool, he's concerned he may be forced to either fight for his home State against the Union or for the Union against his home State. For Scott, he was uncomfortable with the leaked executive order from the White House. Being someone who opposes slavery and owns none himself, he was greatly concerned with the idea that the federal government may impose pro-slavery laws on the North even though Scott himself is a Virginian."

Afterwards in the same paragraph of this declaration, he decreed that the United States Congress be assembled in Musical Hall of San Francisco, the city he lives in. It appears as though the populace of the city had gone along with him in a joking mindset, but of which is slowly beginning to morph into serious devotion. \n \nHe holds no close ties to the Military, so we can easily choose to ignore him. However, such a bold move by one man that is beginning to be taken seriously by the people of his hometown is beginning to represent the forgotten legitimacy of the Federal Government during this time of crisis."

 acw_generic.119.t: "Norton Grows in Influence"
 acw_generic.119.d: "As we have not sent forces to counteract the mutiny, our officers and loyal National Guardsmen were forced to leave San Francisco. Such a move has made Norton grow in fame across the entirety of California, and this has become worrying as we approach a very controversial election.
