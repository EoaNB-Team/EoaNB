 mexico.3.t: "Political Opponents Stir Unrest!"
 mexico.3.d: "Upon hearing president Ignacio Comonfort, many of the radical liberals started protesting his actions including Benito Juárez, a military general, who was next in line for the presidency.

 mexico.3.e: "Upon hearing president Ignacio Comonfort, many of the radical liberals started protesting his actions after the announcement. Though it seems the conservatives have begun rounding up political opponents, including Benito Juárez a military general who was next in line for the presidency. This is not the path to a peaceful conclusion to the civil war!"
 mexico.3.a: "Start imprisoning political opponents opposed to the Tacubaya Plan."
 mexico.3.b: "It seems Ignacio Comonfort is an idealist unable to see our struggles."
 mexico.4.t: "The Crackdown Backfires! Unrest on the Rise!"
 mexico.4.d: "Civil unrest has only grown since the start of the lock-ups of radical liberals and tensions have been brewing between Mexico's different parties. It might be time for president Ignacio Comonfort to acquire extraordinary powers to enforce the plan but taking a moderate approach should be taken into consideration to avoid any more escalations."
 mexico.4.a: "El presidente Ignacio Comonfort could obtain extraordinary powers to pardon them..."
 mexico.5.t: "Felix Maria Zuloaga Demands Resignation"

Now it is time to choose sides on this conflict."

 mexico.7.t: "The Plan de Navidad"

Only time will tell which one is the better option."
 mexico.7.a: "Overthrow Felix Maria Zuloaga for the Christmas Plan"
 mexico.8.t: "A New President"

 mexico.13.a: "Promote Him"
 mexico.14.t: "A New Candidate"
 mexico.14.d: "The Reform War has begun and our nation is split. The Constitution of 1857 should be ended before it does any more damage to the Catholic Church as well as the military.

 mexico.15.a: "Promote Him"
 mexico.16.t: "A New Candidate"

 mexico.25.t: "Disbanding The Parliament"
 mexico.25.d: "As the troops loyal to Miguel Miramón stormed the state parliaments, we ended this coup of the moderates and the church against our federal republic.

Currently the monarchists are waging war against liberal rebels who are supported by the United States.

Certainly the possible expansion of US influence on the southern border is worrying and a stable government in line with French interests would benefit us. We would also ensure the debt payment they owe to our investors."
