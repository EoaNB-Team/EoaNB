  Factionalism_tt_delayed: "Frances political system is at odds with each other. Calling it a Far-right political union would be a gross understatement of the bribes and corruption that breathe throughout the French state. At all times there is someone, somewhere, with a differing opinion. These individuals must be hunted down until their very extinction.\n\nDepending on your level of Factionalism your stability and political power factors will increase/decrease. The Factionalism Fervour modifier will also tick up by a variable of §R+1§! every month so be sure to keep it maintained!\n\nThese modifiers adjust §YMonthly§! and are as follows:\n\nLow Factionalism:\n      £political_power_texticon  Political Power Gain: §G+10.00%§!\n      £stability_texticon  Stability: §G+10.00%§!\n      £stability_popularity_texticon  Party Popularity Stability Modifier: §G+10.00%§!\n\nMedium Factionalism:\n      £political_power_texticon  Political Power Gain: §R-5.00%§!\n      £stability_texticon  Stability: §R-5.00%§!\n      £stability_popularity_texticon  Party Popularity Stability Modifier: §R-5.00%§!\n\nHigh Factionalism:\n      £political_power_texticon  Political Power Gain: §R-10.00%§!\n      £stability_texticon  Stability: §R-10.00%§!\n      £stability_popularity_texticon  Party Popularity Stability Modifier: §R-10.00%§!\n"
