### DECISIONS
DMY_decision_navy: "[ROOT.getname] Naval Expansion"
DMY_decision_navy_desc: "The Japanese Islands have always had a vested interest in seafaring, expanding their reaches to close by islands and reefs for greater fishing and naval capabilities. This way of thinking has not changed. The Daimyos of Edo all border the great seas and have the same capabilities as the Shgun. The doctrine of fleets has only been increasing, and our Daimyo of [ROOT.GetName] will get involved. Enacting a set of requirements for our naval expansion will stabilize our country and secure our position as the pride of the Eastern fleets!"
