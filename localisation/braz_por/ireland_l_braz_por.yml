 ireland.1.t: "Crisis Looms Large"
 ireland.1.d: "Our new Republic has been faced with problems and strife before, but the Unionist Tensions have flared up. Several armed groups have demanded that our government recognize their struggle and their political movement as a legitimate.\n\nWe are faced with a tough decision; some hot-headed Republicans believe this is enough motive to round up all the Unionists once and for all, while some are surprisingly in favour of giving them full recognition and even autonomy!\n\nWe can either give them everything they want, and benefit from their wealth, or destroy them, ravaging our country in war once again. Or maybe we can take the long route, and come to a common agreement between us all?\n"

Entire chunks of the country are demanding that the Unionist Government form a coalition with another popular party, or step down entirely! Some are threatening diplomatic actions, but the old IRB Leaders are not being quite about their own plans for us!\n\nIf we agree to step down, the Unionists will be outraged, particularly in the North. If we strike back with force, we will be on the brink of civil war. We can always ask our friends in Britain for help, but that will give the Republicans even more support. We must decide what to do, or face the chaos of war."

However, the Red Hand organization has offered to help us where the British won’t, while accepting this help may ensure we hold on to power, many would be un-happy with this and will surely lead to anarchy.

 ireland.11.a: "Great!"
 ireland.12.t: "IRB Coup the Government!"
 ireland.12.d: "Earlier today the IRB stormed key government buildings and seized power of the nation swiftly.
