AFG_idea_afghan_splintering: "Afghan Splinter State"
AFG_idea_afghan_splintering_desc: "Following the collapse of the Durrani Empire, Afghanistan dissolved into infighting Durrani remnants, smaller Pashtun emirates, and various warlords. The British invasion of the country in 1839 didn't help either, and Afghanistan continued to be severely divided, until the Barakzai rulers of Kabul returned, pushed the British out, and began consolidating power and annexing smaller emirates. Now only a few splinter states are left with the Barakzai Emirate of Afghanistan being the main contender, but despite this, Afghanistan still stands disunified."
