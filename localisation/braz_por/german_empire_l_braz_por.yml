germany.13.a: "Alright..."
germany.14.t: "[QNG.GetNameDef] is intervening against our military presence"
germany.14.d: "Ever since we have expanded our military presence in China to the areas outside of our trade ports, unrest has been growing in those regions.

#FLAVOUR EVENTS
germany.101.t: "Heinrich Schliemann - Excavations at Hisarlik"
germany.101.d: "Heinrich Schliemann, a wealthy tradesman and amateur archeologist from Mecklenburg, has recently started excavations near the ancient settlement of Hisarlik, at the Aegean Sea in the Ottoman Empire. Schliemann believes the ancient ruins of the mythological city of Troy to lie buried underneath these hills, and is confirmed in his belief by the British expatriate and amateur archeologist Frank Calvert. The team at the site seems determined to prove their theory over the next months and years."
germany.101.a: "Sounds promising."
germany.102.t: "Heinrich Schliemann - Priam's Treasure Found"
germany.102.d: "Breaking news reaches us from the Ottoman Empire, indicating the discovery of the ancient and mythical city of Troy! It was until recently considered by many to be a legend and fictional, but excavations carried out by archeologist Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlik unearthed the secrets that the ground had held for centuries. Schliemann also found a sizable amount of jewelry, gold and artifacts, which he believes to be the so-called 'Priam's treasure', named after the Homeric King Priam. The most notable uncovered pieces of the treasure include weapons mostly made of copper, two gold diadems and other copper artifacts. Although the findings are yet to be confirmed, this discovery has the potential to change the way we teach and view the history of Greece and its mythology forever."
germany.102.a: "What a discovery!"
germany.103.t: "Heinrich Schliemann - Mycenae Excavations"
germany.103.d: "With the help of other renown archeologists like Wilhelm Dörpfeld, Heinrich Schliemann has started new excavation works with the hope of uncovering further truth about Greek mythology at Mycenae, a hillside north of the valley of Argos, on the Greek peninsula of the Peloponnese. Schliemann believes this location to hide secrets involving the Mycenaean king Agamemnon, leader of the Achaeans in Homer's epic of the Trojan War, the 'Iliad'. After his discoveries at Hisarlik, public interest in this new excavation project is believed to be massive."
germany.103.a: "Schliemann is onto something again."
germany.104.t: "Heinrich Schliemann - Mask of Agamemnon Found"
germany.104.d: "A major breakthrough at the archeological site of Mycenae was registered today: Heinrich Schliemann, the German archeologist that unearthed Troy a few years ago, has discovered the Shaft Graves, a royal cemetery. Nineteen bodies have been uncovered in total: eight men, nine women, and two children, as well as the goods and weapons of the deceased that are present there. One of the most impressive artifacts found was a golden mask that Schliemann calls the 'Mask of Agamemnon', named after the legendary Mycenaean king Agamemnon. These findings are yet to be confirmed for their historical value, but it surely seems like another spectacular succes for Schliemann."
germany.104.a: "This guy!"
germany.105.t: "Konrad Duden's First Dictionary of German Spelling"
germany.105.d: "Dr. Konrad Duden, a grammar school principal from Schleiz, has authored a monography called 'Deutsche Rechtschreibung', or 'German Spelling'. As one of its key components, this book contains a dictionary of the German language that lists example words that follow his language principle. Dr. Duden teaches in a region where three German dialects overlap, each with its own spelling features, and the evaluation of the students' orthography depends heavily on the linguistic tradition their teacher was raised in. Duden's dictionary adapts the spelling of the words to be more phonetically accurate and consistent, and it seems vastly more practical and easier to learn and use. His work will definitely be used by experts to push for a unified spelling system instead of keeping the teacher-based language learning system that has thus far dictated which spelling variant the student learns. Since this work simplifies the German language, it is possible that those of lower education could become more literate than has been the case in the past, which Duden has commented that was his goal. He certainly seems intent on continuing his work on the simplification and unification of the German language."
germany.105.a: "Certainly interesting."
germany.106.t: "Conference for the Establishment of Greater Unity in German Spelling"
germany.106.d: "At the behest of the Prussian ministry of education and cultural affairs, 14 specialists of the German language have gathered in Berlin for the 'Conference for the Establishment of Greater Unity in German Spelling' or otherwise called 'Orthographical Conference'. On the basis of a draft by the Germanist Rudolf von Raumer, the participants will discuss possible solutions to the various problems in the days ahead. Dr. Konrad Duden, the school principal responsible for one of the most influential works on the topic, is also present at the conference. This sparks hope that inner unification of the country might be advanced further."
germany.106.a: "Well, good luck."
germany.107.t: "[PRS.GetLeader] Vetoes the Resolution of the Orthographical Conference"
germany.107.d: "The orthographical conference in Berlin ended ten days ago, and the specialists present did come to some important conclusions and presented their resolution to the public and the Prussian government. They have been facing considerable backlash from a variety of sources over the last days, however. Many critics doubt that the changes can be successful as they are deemed too extensive. The Prussian prime minister, [PRS.GetLeader], has today vetoed the resolution of the orthographical conference, and, thus, it has to be considered a failure. The struggle for some sort of unity in the German spelling system will continue."
germany.107.a: "That's a bummer."
germany.108.t: "Duden Publishes 'Complete Orthographic Dictionary of the German Language'"
germany.108.d: "Dr. Konrad Duden has finally achieved his goal of a comprehensive dictionary of the German language. The book is titled 'Vollständiges Orthographisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache', or 'C'omplete Orthographic Dictionary of the German Language'. It contains a staggering 27,000 words on 187 pages that fulfilled everything Dr. Duden wished to do with the current spelling systems taught in schools all over the German states. Unfortunately, it still seems that the Prussian ministry of education and cultural affairs and the prime minister, [PRS.GetLeader], who also happens to be Chancellor of the German Empire, has some reservations regarding the unification of German spelling. Be that as it may, the Prussian government has issued a ban on the usage of Duden's orthography in bureaucracy across Prussia. The reasoning behind this decision is unknown, but here's hoping that this will change in the future, as an easier way of spelling and learning would undoubtedly support the German language in the world."
germany.108.a: "That will undoubtedly have an impact."
germany.109.t: "Second Orthographical Conference Succeeds"
germany.109.d: "Following nearly three decades of debate after the political unification of Germany, the German language will finally have a unified spelling system. Thanks in large part to the continuing efforts of German linguists, teachers, and politicians, spearheaded by Dr. Konrad Duden, the Second Orthographical Conference had more success than its prequel 25 years ago. Over the last three days, 26 plenipotentiaries of the German states, Dr. Huemer as Austrian commissioner, and representatives of other institutions as well as the book trade met and discussed the standardization of a uniform German orthography in Berlin. In addition to state officials, a few experts took part, including Konrad Duden and Wilhelm Wilmanns, who had also already participated in the First Orthographical Conference in 1876. The resolution was accepted by both German and Austrian state officials, and, thus, is binding. It is also expected that [SWI.GetName] will join the resolution for German spelling shortly."
germany.109.a: "Finally!"

#Country Leader Descriptions
OLD_PETER_VON_ROSSING_LEADER_DESC: "Born on February 4, 1805, into a noble family, Peter von Rössing made his way into the political sphere after graduating from the University of Göttingen in 1834. He held a variety of offices following his graduation, being that of an auditor, an assessor, a chamberlain, and even reaching the role of High Court Chancellor within the Military High Court and the Military Collegium. It was not until May 1st, 1851, however, following the resignation of former president Dietrich Christian von Buttel, that von Rössing obtained his current position as President of the General Ministry. Since then, he has achieved several notable changes. The first of which was the constitutional revision of the Basic Law of the State of 1849, which was deemed necessary to alter in a conservative sense following the failed Revolution of 1848 and 1849. He also successfully managed to regulate the conditions of the Protestant Church of Oldenburg in 1853, alongside the reorganisation of the teaching and education system in 1855."
