SWI_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Nestled in the heart of Europe, Switzerland stands as a neutral bastion amidst the political upheavals surrounding it. A decade has passed since the Swiss Civil War, which solidified the federal state and resolved the tensions between conservative Catholic cantons and the progressive forces in Bern. The new Federal Constitution of 1848 marked the country's transformation, balancing the autonomy of cantons with a centralized government.\n\nSwitzerland’s neutrality is respected, but tensions remain high among its diverse linguistic and religious communities. Despite avoiding Europe’s revolutionary conflicts, internal divisions still threaten the fragile unity.\n\nIndustrialization is slowly taking root and ambitious railway projects now cross the Alps, linking the nation to Europe’s economy and marking a new era of development. Switzerland's future remains uncertain. Will it continue successfully navigating its course as a neutral and decentralized state, or will internal divisions and external pressures force the Confederation to change its path?"

 ### Swiss Focus Tree ###
 SWI_Elect_Guillaume: "Elect Guillaume"
 SWI_Elect_Guillaume_desc: "A storm is rising over the Alps! The Bundesversammlung has elected the Sonderbundkrieg veteran Guillaume Henri Dufour as General, he shall have the authority to deal with any foreign policy crisis, which may occur, because of our neighbours' imperialistic ambitions."
 SWI_Neuenburgerhandel: "Neuenburgerhandel"
 SWI_Neuenburgerhandel_desc: "Prussia has renewed their claims over the Neuchatel province, since 1815 part of our Confederation, but also a crown land of the Prussian monarchs. This has caused a great crisis between our two countries. Newly elected General Dufour shall tackle the current crisis in Neuchatel, and he recognised already, that any war between Switzerland and Prussia, one of the great powers, would be costly. In light of the unfolding events, he has thus taken the position that we have to avoid a war against Prussia, until war is the ultima ratio."
 SWI_Prepare_for_Invasion: "Prepare for an Invasion"
 SWI_Prepare_for_Invasion_desc: "We are getting the information that Prussia is preparing to invade us. Around 130k-140k are mobilised by the Prussians and are ready to begin their march. Since they have to cross the south and central German States before arriving at our border, we have some time left to prepare. As part of our preperations we need to fill our arms reserve and prepare our forts at the Rhine River. We need also to prepare the army, as we aim to take the fight to Baden and keep it out of Switzerland. Who knows, perhaps we would have some unexpected assistance if war breaks out? But for know, we have to prepare for the worst..."
 SWI_talk_with_prussia: "Talk with Prussia"
 SWI_talk_with_prussia_desc: "As the other Great Powers have expressed their opinion and showed to Prussia that they do not support them in the Neuchatel crisis, perhaps we could manage to negotiate a solution to the crisis, as we have the edge over Prussia now. Whilst we have the option to tell them that we would not give up a inch of our demands, this would increase the chance of war. It may be in our and their best interest to negotiate a compromise, so that the Prussians can keep their face and we can celebrate the definitive integration of Neuchatel into our Confederation."
 SWI_paris: "Treaty of Paris"
 SWI_paris_desc: "The Prussians have agreed to our offer and during the last days negotiations were held with the Prussians to determine, how the crisis shall end and what the measures will be. At last we have managed to come up with a treaty that gives us full control over Neuchatel, but still gives Prussian monarchs the right to claim the title of 'Prince of Neuchatel'!"
 SWI_hold_prussians_at_rhine: "Hold Prussians at the Rhine"
 SWI_hold_prussians_at_rhine_desc: "Although we had the Great Powers on our side and were ready to negotiate and to find a compromise, Prussia refused to negotiate a treaty, but instead decided to go to war. As Prussia has not yet declared war, we still have time to prepare. The time to negotiate is over - now it's time to fight! We will send our troops into Baden to take the fight to them, in accordance to our plan. May we come out on top!"
 SWI_Savoyerhandel: "Savoyerhandel"
 SWI_Savoyerhandel_desc: "As a part of their French-Sardinian Alliance, Sardinia has declared that it will transfer Savoy to France, if they come out on top in their war against the Austrians. That is indeed the case now, and from our perspective the transfer of Savoy is a violation of the decisions in the Congress of Vienna and could be a danger for us, if France wants to integrate certain territories of ours. And because of that we should use our right, given by the Great Powers in the Congress of Vienna, to occupy Savoy until the situation is resolved!"
 SWI_Preemptive_full_Occupation: "Preemptive Full Occupation"
 SWI_Preemptive_full_Occupation_desc: "We cannot stay neutral if there is a threat to our countries integrity and sovereignity! The French would see a integration of Savoy into their state as only a first step and then perhaps begin longing after our French-speaking part of Switzerland, the Romandie! We have to prevent this from happening - and we will do that by occupying Savoy preemptively, as our hardliners in the Parliament already proposed!"
 SWI_bear_consequences: "Bear the Consequences"
 SWI_bear_consequences_desc: "It is our duty to secure Switzerland's independence and integrity! Sometimes we have to pay a high price for this, like in our situation right now. The French have distanced themselves from us as a result from our Savoyan occupation! But we have to bear the consequences if we want to protect our country - whatever they will be!"
 SWI_establish_canton: "Savoyan Canton"
 SWI_establish_canton_desc: "With time going on it is clear that we will not be able to keep Savoy under military occupation for a long time. As they are not ready to join our confederation just yet and are opposing the idea of it, we should begin with the integration of Savoy to show them the advantages of our Swiss state! Establishing a canton in Savoy will also help us to ease the burden of the administration. So, welcome to our Swiss Family, Canton Savoy!"
 SWI_talk_to_french: "Talks with France"
 SWI_talk_to_french_desc: "It would be not the best idea to use force in this situation, as it may give France a casus belli against us, and lead to their invasion of the Romandie. A wiser step is to try and find a solution to our crisis with diplomacy! Perhaps we will be able to come to an agreement that grants us our territorial integrity."
 SWI_occupy_north: "Occupy Haute-Savoie"
 SWI_occupy_north_desc: "The Congress of Vienna gave us the right to occupy the North of Savoy, also called Haute-Savoie, in case France ever tries to annex Savoy again, whilst also not give up our neutrality. Perhaps we should pursue with this path instead of refusing negotiations all together and occuping the entirety of Savoy."
 SWI_naps_plebiscite: "Napoleon IIIs Plebiscite"
 SWI_naps_plebiscite_desc: "Our diplomatic ambitions have brought some results - there will be two plebiscites in Savoy dealing with the integration of Savoy into France. The first one dealing with the question, if Savoy will be integrated into France proper and the second one dealing with the question of the establishment of a Savoyan Free Trade Zone, that is not being influenced by French governmental decisions, from which our economy would profit. Whilst it may not be every demand that was accepted, it is still a good deal for Switzerland, even if some of our citizens may not be happy with it!"
 SWI_1857_mil_reforms: "The 1857 Military Reforms"
 SWI_1857_mil_reforms_desc: "We have started a military reform in 1850, with which we have managed to solve some issues, and which ensured the centralisation of our army. But some issues persisted and have returned. Because of that, we will have to start a second reform of our military, with the goal of solving these problems."
 SWI_Establish_Oberinstruktor: "Establish the 'Oberinstruktor der Infanterie'"
 SWI_Establish_Oberinstruktor_desc: "We have thought about establishing a new position in our military, the 'Oberinstruktor', the head general of all generals. These ideas were already experimented with, for example, with the 'Oberinstruktor der Artillerie' being a success already, showing that establishing such a position is not a hinderance for our armed forces."
 SWI_centralised_appointment: "Centralised Appointment"
 SWI_centralised_appointment_desc: "Our high command is the most appropriate option to choose our 'Oberinstruktor', as they have the most experience in our army and they will be able to find the most fitting and loyal candidate for this position."
 SWI_non_mill_oberinstruktors: "Non-Military Oberinstruktors"
 SWI_non_mill_oberinstruktors_desc: "Some of the most influential members of the high command will eventually wish to resign from the high command and the military all together. Whilst they will begin a new chapter in their lives, some my go into politics etc., they still wish to able to teach the 'Instruktors'. In such a case. should we allow non-military personnel to interfere in the education of our soldiers, even if they go into politics and could be influenced by their ideologies?"
 SWI_decentralised_appointment: "Decentralised Appointment"
 SWI_decentralised_appointment_desc: "With the high command choosing the 'Oberinstruktor', we may give them too much power and they would perhaps lobbying for the candidate that they think is good enough for this, but not the best objective one. A decentralised approach to this question would ensure that the best candidate gets the position, instead of the high command's candidate."
 SWI_Stabsleitungshilfe: "Stabsleitungshilfe"
 SWI_Stabsleitungshilfe_desc: "Our decentralised approach does lead to the most competent officiers become 'Oberinstruktor'. With that in mind, we should allow the 'Oberinstruktoren' to assist the high command whenever the high command wishes to be helped."
 SWI_expand_posistion: "Expand the Position of Oberinstruktor"
 SWI_expand_posistion_desc: "With the implementation of the position of 'Oberinstruktor', our army has become even more effective than it was prior. That shows that having a 'Oberinstruktor' is not just not hampering, but also strenghten our army! We should thus, begin to establish the position of 'Oberinstruktor' in more sectors of our army!"
 SWI_observe_foreign_conflicts: "Observe Foreign Conflicts"
 SWI_observe_foreign_conflicts_desc: "With numerous conflicts and unrests going on in the world, from America, to Asia, to Europe, we should take the opportunity and observe these conflicts and unrest. Perhaps we could be able to find the weaknesses of the two fighting sides and improve our own army by that. With our experiences we can also look forward to improve our defenses to hinder any foreign country to invade us and succeed in that."
 SWI_import_foreign_expertise: "Import Foreign Expertise"
 SWI_import_foreign_expertise_desc: "Another way to improve our army is to import foreign expertise, may it be in the form of foreign weapons, that we can use in the army and produce for ourselves, or be it with foreign army experts comming to Switzerland and giving us information on how we can improve our army structure, equipment and so on..."
 SWI_learn_from_Sonderbundskrieg: "Learn from the Sonderbundskrieg"
 SWI_learn_from_Sonderbundskrieg_desc: "Whilst we have the opportunity to look into conflicts all around the world, we can also look into a war, where we were involved, the Sonderbundskrieg. Whilst we may have won our own civil war 10 years ago, we still had weaknesses, as well as the enemy faction had. Also, there was a modernising process in the last 10 years regarding tactics, and so, our own tactics we used, are outdated now. With us now being reunited, it is possible to analyse these weaknesses and come up with solutions, how we can eradicate these weaknesses, and also implement new tactics!"
 SWI_update_doctrines: "Update Outdated Doctrines"
 SWI_update_doctrines_desc: "Now that we have observed several wars and conflicts and have gathered a look into modern weaponry and tactics, it is time to update our own doctrines, to be able to defend our territory from our possible enemies!"
 SWI_project_festrung: "Start Project Festung"
 SWI_project_festrung_desc: "Our borders are mostly covered by rivers, mountains and seas, the Rhine in the north and east, the Alps in our eastern and southern borders, and Lake Geneva on our border with Savoy. But besides of this, 40% of our territory have no natural borders for protection. And since we have this situation, we could start the 'Project Festung', which allows us to strenghten our defenses at our non-natural protected borders with our neighbours."
 SWI_human_convention: "Human Convention"
 SWI_human_convention_desc: "War can be horrifing. That's what the most soldiers, generals and politicians in war experience. But there have be no ambitions to stop war and fighting altogether, and it is a unrealistic goal to reach. But what can be done to improve the treatment of the wounded, dead or alive soldiers in a battle? Some politicians and generals wish to start the 'Humanitarian Convention', which shall give war rules and allow a better treatment of the fighting forces from ones country. We wish them luck on their hopeless quest to a more human fighting in wars."
 SWI_question_centralisation: "The Question of Centralisation"
 SWI_question_centralisation_desc: "One of the results of the 1850 reforms was that the Bundesheer was centralised to a certain degree. One of the biggest changes affected by the reforms was the way that conscriptions were handeled. In the current system all males are conscripted for a certain time in their lives. The Cantons were given the right to decide where their military factories where they wish. During the last 7 years, since the last reform, 3 factions in regard to dealing with this topic have appeared. The first one seeks a centralisation of the army, thinking this would make the army better and more effective, the second seeks a stronger decentralisation of the army, wishing that the Cantons have more to say in this matter, and the third one is fairly neutral and wants to keep the current system as a compromise between the two more extreme sides. Now we have to decide, which path we want to follow."
 SWI_keep_current_system: "Keep the Current System"
 SWI_keep_current_system_desc: "Keeping our current system will ensure that a compromise between the two sides still stands and both sides will be appeased by our decision."
 SWI_Establish_Militardepartement: "Establish the Military-Departement"
 SWI_Establish_Militardepartement_desc: "We will establish a supervisor for the production lines, the Militärdepartment! This will allow us to keep an eye on our production and ensure our soldiers always can use the most modern and most reliable weaponry available."
 SWI_Educate_officers: "Educate the Officers"
 SWI_Educate_officers_desc: "If we want to get and keep a strong army, we will have to ensure that our officers and junior officers get educated properly. Only then, we will be able to put up a fight."
 SWI_Waffenplatz_Thun: "Waffenplatz Thun"
 SWI_Waffenplatz_Thun_desc: "With more and better weapons being produced, we will have to expand our 'Waffenplätze' to ensure that we will have enough place to store our weapons. But we will not just expand our current 'Waffenplatz', but also build a military academy in Thun, where we can educate our generals in addition to our other military academies!"
 SWI_mill_academy: "Thun Military Academy"
 SWI_mill_academy_desc: "The Thun Military Academy has been established a short while ago, with the expansion of the Waffenplatz Thun. We want to make the new Thun Academy the place, where important new doctrines will be researched and officiers and junior officiers get teached in combat, by more experienced army members."
 SWI_increase_conscription: "Increase our Conscription"
 SWI_increase_conscription_desc: "Now that we secured our weaponry and our supply, we should look forward and increase our conscription to be able to increase the safety and security of our country."
 SWI_tax_cut: "Cut Taxes with Service"
 SWI_tax_cut_desc: "We will have to incentivise the army service, if we want to achieve that more persons conscript themselves into the army. One way of doing this is to cut taxes from former soldiers, who finished basic training. With this way we could achieve the same effects as with a mandatory service without the people having the side effects of mandatory services!"
 SWI_keep_arms: "Right to Keep Arms"
 SWI_keep_arms_desc: "Our army is relatively small in comparison to our neighbours ones. If we were attacked by one of our neighbours, we would have great problems, even if the Alps are an imprengable barrier. To prevent these problems, the Bundesrat has proposed that every citizen, that has finished his basic training in the army, shall be allowed to keep his rifle to be able to defend himself when another country decides to truly invade us!"
 SWI_Eidgenossische: "Swiss Army"
 SWI_Eidgenossische_desc: "The problems that we had left after 1850 were fixable with our current system and we proved it! With our military reforms we have managed to fix our leftover problems, we strenghthened our defense against other countries and we managed to stabilise our army! Switzerland shall never be conquered, if we are to be wiped out the invader shall be as well!"
 SWI_centralise: "Centralise the Army"
 SWI_centralise_desc: "During the Sonderbundskrieg in 1848 we fought to centralise the Swiss Cantons and establish one centralist Swiss state. But, for some reason, our army stayed uncentralised and thus unorganised until now! It is time to fullfil our promises of centralising the army. It would certainly help us if we are being attacked sometime in the future. Why did we wait all these years?"
 SWI_take_over_production: "Take over Production Lines"
 SWI_take_over_production_desc: "We need to nationalise the production lines and weapons and the factories that are producing them. By that measure we will be able to first produce and use the weapons for a cheaper price then if we buy them from our - or foreign -  businessmans! We could also guarantee a steady flow of certified and modern weaponry, from which our soldiers and civilians will profit!"
 SWI_cream_of_crop: "Recruit Cream of the Crop"
 SWI_cream_of_crop_desc: "We need to change we are conscripting our citizens into the army. From now on it shall be the strongest recruits, which will form our active army and fight for us if we are ever attacked. It shall be a honor to deal for the great Swiss people from now on!"
 SWI_leadership: "Question of Leadership"
 SWI_leadership_desc: "Now that we have decided how to fare with the conscription of our soldiers, we still have to see who we will put in charge of the different armies. We have a lot of generals that are suited from that job, but we will have to decide, which ones are the best."
 SWI_seperate_reserves: "Seperate Reserves from Soldiers"
 SWI_seperate_reserves_desc: "Why should we have both a active army and reserves that are being trained the same things during peacetime. We only need to teach the active soldiers and train them to fight in wars etc. . We can use the reserves in other ways, like to assist in certain things in civilian lives."
 SWI_german_words: "Wir stehen wie die Alpen fest!"
 SWI_german_words_desc: "Our glorious army has been fully centralised by now. We shall not be threatened by a foreign power anymore! The only opposition we still have left, comes from some factions in Switzerland. But alas, as time passes, those whispers will vanish as well, as the centralised army becomes normality."
 SWI_decentralise: "Decentralise Army, Raise Militias"
 SWI_decentralise_desc: "The Cantons do have a lot of authority over their territory, preventing them from self-defending in cases of attack seems unfair to them. And they are right, which is why we will allow the individual Cantons to raise their own Militias, that have the job to defend their Cantons, but also Switzerland in extension. These Militias will operate independently from our Army, which will be decentralised by this beginning process."
 SWI_decentralise_production: "Decentralise Army Productions"
 SWI_decentralise_production_desc: "Since the individual Cantons have the authority over raising army parts and militias now, we can also delegate the responsibilty for equiping these parts to them, as they will now best, what exactly they will need to produce!"
 SWI_Militiasman_book: "The Militiasman Handbook"
 SWI_Militiasman_book_desc: "We, or rather the Cantons, had the idea of giving the newly established militia units a handbook, in which they will find a lot of useful informations, maps and other important instructions. This will certainly help in the short-term teaching of these militias!"
 SWI_guerilla: "Teach Guerilla Warfare"
 SWI_guerilla_desc: "We shall teach all militias how guerilla warfare works, as it is a useful tactic when a stronger foreign power occupies your state, like Spain showed Europe during Napoleon's occupation of Iberia. In case we ever get the same experience this will help us to engage in warfare even after surrendering or in case our army collapses during a invasion."
 SWI_restrict: "Restrict the Army"
 SWI_restrict_desc: "Now that the Cantons' Militias are almost ready to be conscripted, we still need to think about the army. Whilst they are useful during wartime and are still needed for fighting during these times, we need to see what we are going to do with the army whilst we are at peace."
 SWI_disband: "Disband the Army"
 SWI_disband_desc: "Now that the Cantons' Militias are almost ready to be conscripted, we still need to think about the army. It has become increasingly clear during the last days, since the establishment of these militias, that they are being supported more than our regular, centralised army. With the Militias even organised and equiped better than our army is and it become better in fights, due to their guerilla warfare, it is perhaps time to disband our army and just use the militias now!"
 SWI_raise_militia: "Raise the Milita"
 SWI_raise_militia_desc: "The Militias were trained from the decision to allow them onwards, until now. The first of the Militia units has finished it's training now and is ready to be deployed now!"
 SWI_more_german_words: "Das Volk ist die Armee!"
 SWI_more_german_words_desc: "Through our reforms we have managed to decentralise our army and to establish individual defence forces for every Canton. The first Militias are already deployed. Whilst we have now established a Confederate Army, we still have a centralised political system. Perhaps we should take a look at that, and see whether we can implement our army model there?"
 SWI_paris_2:"Peace Treaty Of Paris"
 SWI_paris_2_desc:"We have done it! The Prussians have been defeated and most of Baden is under our control, this gives the upper hand and ww can now begin peace talks, and even id the prussians refuse our kind offer, sooner or later the French Empire will break their neutrality, join our side to put an end to this, conflict, our victory is only a matter of time...

 swiss.1.t: "French Have Won"
 swiss.1.d: "The short war that broke out in Savoy ended with a French victory. Resulting in the Swiss forces retreating back over the new border. It is clear that the Swiss were not expecting any French opposistion..."

 swiss.2.t: "Swiss Forces Have Won"

 swiss.5.t: "Switzerland Occupaion of Savoy!"
 swiss.5.d: "Swiss forces have occupied the region of Savoy which is now ours! If we do nothing, it is very likely that Switzerland will annex Savoy.

Whilst they will begin a new chapter in their lives, some my go into politics etc., they still wish to able to teach the 'Instruktors'. In such a case. should we allow non-military personnel to interfere in the education of our soldiers, even if they go into politics and could be influenced by their ideologies?"
