	# IDEAS
	CAU_fighters: "Caucasian Ghazawat"
	CAU_fighters_desc: "A Ghazwa (plural Ghazawat) is a battle or raid against non-Muslims; The people of Caucasus have rallied under Islam to resist the Russian Invasion - they do so through irregular warfare, which is especially effective in the mountainous terrain of Circassia and Dagestan"
	CAU_muridism: "Muridism"
	CAU_muridism_desc: "Muridism was the political-military ideology of the Northern Caucasians from the 1820’s through 1860’s. It aimed to unite all Caucasian Muslims (thus removing the split caused by the various schools of Islam that existed in Caucasus) in a holy war for freedom against the Russian invaders. Muridism was deeply grounded in the Islamic faith and was used to construct a modern, efficient, united and centralized state. It is represented in-game with national ideas and laws."
	CAU_fierce_resistance: "Fierce Resistance"
	CAU_fierce_resistance_weak: "Fierce Resistance"
  CAU_nomadic_artillery: "Shoot-and-scoot"
  CAU_nomadic_artillery_desc: "For the Tsarist troops, Talhig's innovations were completely unexpected. Talhig's artillery was practically elusive: having given several shots from guns at the tsarist troops, he quickly moved on a horse-drawn carriage to another place, from where he again inflicted damage on the Russians. This was repeated periodically. Dragoons and Cossacks who rushed to the sound of shots did not find artillery on the spot. The Russians called this tactic of the mountaineers "nomadic artillery"."

It has enlisted the services of Dr. Millingen, who would become the Quarantine Officer at Trabzon, to distribute the collected funds appropriately among the refugees in Istanbul. Dr. Millingen has been sending regular updates to the Press back home in the hope that more support would be attracted by his accounts of the refugees’ suffering. Contributions were sent over as soon as they came in, “since every pound sent at once may save a life”."
