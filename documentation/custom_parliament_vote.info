# HOW TO IMPLEMENT CUSTOM VOTES FOR EOANB USING THE PARLIAMENT SYSTEM
# By AtomicSoviet
#
# This reference document will show two example events, the first one being the setup for the vote
# and the second one being the results of the votes.
# Using the Parliament system rather than a more direct vote system allow the use of the Parliament
# interactions and to make your votes more dynamic. Thus, I recommend using this system.
#
# Note: If you have any questions, about the structure or even about everything related to the party
# issues and all of that, contact me directly.

# This very scary series of code lines are very easy to use
# For each ideology, ^0 represents Cultural Issues, ^1 represents Economic Issues, ^2 represents Demographic Issues, ^3 represents War Issues and ^4 represents Monetary Policy (aka budget) Issues.
# The value assigned to each of them is the ID already shown earlier in "ISSUES ID DOCUMENTATION".
# You can individually change them in an event by just copy-pasting the correspoding line and assigning a new value to it.
#
# Note: I haven't tested the load order of the files, so your on_startup setup might get overwritten by the generic one. If that happens, notify me and I'll try to find a solution.
