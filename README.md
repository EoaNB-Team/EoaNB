## Troubleshooting

### Crashes
`Recalculating Naval Distances Crash`: The current build of our mod crashes during the game-booting process between the launcher window and the main menu for some users with incompatible graphics cards. A good fix for most users has been to enter the Steam Library and enter the option `-opengl` into Hearts of Iron 4's launch settings. <a href="https://github.com/team-eoanb/EoaNB/wiki/Common-Troubleshooting-Actions"> Instructions Here</a>

`Railgun Crash`: There is a railgun tech in our mod that crashes the user when they hover over the tech icon. We are still unsure what is causing this crash and are looking for a fix.

### Other notable issues
`Save Game Load Times`: It is a notable issue of how long save games take to load. Our average developer notices it takes them 5-10 minutes to load a save; longer as the game progresses past 1880. This issue is to be addressed with Ars Bellica.

## Join the Team

If you wish to contribute to the development of the mod, support us on Patreon or join the team. The links to support/apply can be found in our `#faq` channel on Discord. Donators will be given the special Auxillaires role on Discord which gives backdoor access to most of our development process/work and given special personalized easter eggs in our mod. Applicant Developers will be given the `Curia` Team Member Role and the `Disciplio` Trial Role. After passing the Trial Period, members will be fully accepted into the team and be given GitHub write access if applicable.

### Rules for Developers
- Current General Development for EoaNB shall be pushed onto the `(0.3)-Ars-Bellica` branch.
- All code should be error-checked before pushed onto the Github
- Merging should be done carefully and procedurely. Do not override other developers' work without acknowledgment of the team.
- If procedural pushing (including incomplete content) is crucial to development, request a new branch.
- Merging any branch into the master branch (the distributed branch) will require a pull request which can only be initialised by a *Centurion*, and requires the approval of at least another Centurion. Errors are to be checked and minimalised by the Centurion who does the request.
- Additional rules in the **Developer Bible**
