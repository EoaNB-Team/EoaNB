## Troubleshooting

### Crashes
`Recalculating Naval Distances Crash`: The current build of our mod crashes during the game-booting process between the launcher window and the main menu for some users with incompatible graphics cards. A good fix for most users has been to enter the Steam Library and enter the option `-opengl` into Hearts of Iron 4's launch settings. <a href="https://github.com/team-eoanb/EoaNB/wiki/Common-Troubleshooting-Actions"> Instructions Here</a>

`Multiplayer Chat Crash`: The current build of our mod crashes during Multiplayer games when any individual tries to open the *multiplayer chat function* located at the bottom-left of the screen. We are working to fix this, for now please regulate all communication in MP games to voice-calls or other chat platforms.

`Railgun Crash`: There is a railgun tech in our mod that crashes the user when they hover over the tech icon. We are still unsure what is causing this crash and are looking for a fix.

### Other notable issues
`Save Game Load Times`: It is a notable issue of how long save games take to load. Our average developer notices it takes them 5-10 minutes to load a save; longer as the game progresses past 1880. After the Pax Orientalis update, we will work to improving on this issue.

Applicant Developers will be given the `Curia` Team Member Role and the `Disciplio` Trial Role. After passing the Trial Period, members will be fully accepted into the team and be given GitHub write access if applicable.

### Rules for Developers
- Current General Development for EoaNB shall be pushed onto the `Ver-Tersus-(Optimization-and-Finishing-Pax)` branch.
- All code should be error-checked before pushed onto the Github
- Merging should be done carefully and procedurely. Do not override other developers' work without acknowledgment of the team.
- If procedural pushing (including incomplete content) is crucial to development, request a new branch.
- Merging any branch into the master branch (the distributed branch) will require a pull request which can only be initialised by a *Centurion*, and requires the approval of at least another Centurion. Errors are to be checked and minimalised by the Centurion who does the request.
- Additional rules in the **Developer Bible**
